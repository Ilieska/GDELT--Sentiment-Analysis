Law&Crime has cross-referenced the terse and unilluminating docket entries to shed some light on the case.\\n\\nThe entries do not currently list a defense attorney for Allen, but they do say he\\u2019s being held on the aforementioned $20 million bond in \\u201ccash or corporate surety.\\u201d It had previously been reported that Allen was being held without bond.\\n\\nCiting the local prosecutor\\u2019s office and the local sheriff\\u2019s department, Indianapolis FOX affiliate WXIN reported Wednesday evening that the bond entry was some kind of error, but the prosecutor\\u2019s office never returned Law&Crime calls to confirm the dollar amount listed on the docket when we inquired about it earlier Wednesday afternoon. Nor was Law&Crime able to reach the Carroll County Clerk of Court\\u2019s office; it is closed as a matter of usual business on Wednesday afternoons. The Clerk of Court\\u2019s office previously told Law&Crime on Tuesday that it considered the online docket to be the best source of information about the matter going forward.\\n\\nA smattering of other entries in the case docket are dated Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, when news leaked out that Allen had been arrested. It is on that date that the prosecution formally was opened and a \\u201cverified request to prohibit public access\\u201d to the records was filed. An immediate order issued by Carroll County Circuit Judge Benjamin A. Diener sealed various records in the case.\\n\\nThe information and a probable cause affidavit \\u2014 both of which Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas C. McLeland said on Monday would remain sealed \\u2014 were also filed on Oct. 28.\\n\\nMcLeland and the state police announced on Monday that the charges are in connection with the deaths of Liberty \\u201cLibby\\u201d German, 14, and her best friend Abigail \\u201cAbby\\u201d Williams, 13. The young teens vanished while walking the Monon High Bridge Trail near Delphi, Indiana, on Feb. 13, 2017. The trail traverses an abandoned stretch of the old Monon Railroad and crosses a tall trestle.\\n\\nThe court docket indicates, as McLeland previously announced, that Allen is charged with two counts of murder. Until now, we didn\\u2019t know precisely which subsection of Indiana\\u2019s murder charge was at play. The docket says Allen is charged with murder under Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(2), which is a murder involving a specific underlying criminal offense.\\n\\nBasic Murder Law in Indiana\\n\\nBy way of comparison, let\\u2019s start with Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(1), the Hoosier State\\u2019s basic murder statute. It defines and criminalizes murder as having occurred when a person \\u201cknowingly or intentionally kills another human being.\\u201d Those words are brief, but the reality is more complex \\u2014 perhaps explaining why prosecutors did not choose this particular option in Allen\\u2019s case.\\n\\nTo secure a conviction on the basic charge, according to Indiana\\u2019s model jury instructions, the state must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim in a (4) knowing and intentional matter.\\n\\nThat might sound simple, but at times, it is not.\\n\\nProving the fourth element can sometimes be vexing. A review of a few Indiana criminal appeals suggests that convicted defendants do litigate the issue of whether prosecutors proved their crimes were \\u201cknowingly or intentionally\\u201d committed \\u2014 especially in cases which involve an accomplice or a theory of accomplice liability.\\n\\nPlus, in Indiana, voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense to murder, and the model jury instructions suggest that it can operate as somewhat of a default when coupled to a murder charge. Voluntary manslaughter involves a killing committed in \\u201csudden heat.\\u201d The jury instructions say the state has to prove a lack of \\u201csudden heat\\u201d to convict an individual of murder. If the state fails to prove that sudden heat did not exist, manslaughter is proven, and the jury default to that count, the model jury instructions indicate.\\n\\nMurder During Another Crime\\n\\nThat background is important as we look toward the charge the docket says Allen actually is facing. It\\u2019s verbose, but in some ways it is less complex.\\n\\nThe specific charge being alleged against Allen applies when a defendant:\\n\\n(2) kills another human being while committing or attempting to commit arson, burglary, child molesting, consumer product tampering, criminal deviate conduct (under IC 35-42-4-2 before its repeal [this involves deviate sexual conduct]), kidnapping, rape, robbery, human trafficking, promotion of human labor trafficking, promotion of human sexual trafficking, promotion of child sexual trafficking, promotion of sexual trafficking of a younger child, child sexual trafficking, or carjacking (before its repeal)[.]\\n\\nIt is unclear from the docket precisely which underlying offense or offenses is alleged in the Delphi case \\u2014 but the list of possibilities contained within the statute is harrowing.\\n\\nIt is possible that kidnapping is alleged because the authorities long ago publicized a brief video clip recorded by Libby German of someone saying \\u201cguys, down the hill.\\u201d Most of the clip has never been made public, nor have many other details about the grim case. But, again, the docket is silent as to the specifics.\\n\\nRegardless of which underlying offense is at play, the murder charges \\u2014 as they are currently listed under Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(2) \\u2014 will require prosecutors to prove as follows: (1) that the named defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim (4) while \\u201ccommitting or attempting to commit\\u201d the underlying offense.\\n\\nAnd that might be easier, depending on the facts of the case. It appears from the statutes themselves and from the model jury instructions that prosecutors will not have to dance around proving a lack of \\u201csudden heat\\u201d (should the lesser-included offense come into the equation). Nor will prosecutors have to negotiate the minefield of proving that the deaths themselves were knowing or intentional.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, statues such as the one cited in Allen\\u2019s docket require prosecutors only to prove that deaths occurred during the commission of an underlying offense \\u2014 even unintentionally. Again, depending on the facts of the case, that burden can oftentimes be easier for the state to carry.\\n\\nThe decision of which charge to apply to a case is strategic, and here, prosecutors aren\\u2019t saying much. Beyond announcing the charges and indicating that the case file itself remains sealed, they\\u2019ve remained tight lipped. McLeland\\u2019s office has refused to return Law&Crime\\u2019s phone calls even to confirm whether the bail amount is indeed accurate.\\n\\nAdditional Details\\n\\nAccording to the newly revealed docket, initial hearing for Allen was held on Friday, Oct. 28, at 10:30 a.m.\\n\\nThe docket also reveals \\u2014 for the first time \\u2014 when Judge Diener will hold a hearing to ascertain whether any of the currently sealed records in the case will be made public. That hearing is slated for Nov. 22, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., the docket says.\\n\\nAs prosecutors previously announced, a pretrial conference is scheduled for Jan. 13, 2023, at 9 a.m.\\n\\nA jury trial in the matter is currently scheduled to last five days. It\\u2019s scheduled to begin on March 20, 2023, and to conclude on March 24, 2023. It\\u2019s rare that a trial date scheduled this early in a proceeding would, indeed, occur on time, but it does happen from time to time. Much will depend on whether Allen waives his right to a speedy trial or enforces that constitutional right.\\n\\nUnder Indiana Criminal Procedure Rule 4, defendants can file a motion for an \\u201cearly trial.\\u201d If such a motion is filed, trial must be held within 70 days of the date of the request. That same rule also contemplates that a criminal trial be held within six months of an arrest \\u2014 though defendants can request delays, usually so their attorneys can examine evidence and mount a defense.\\n\\nLaw&Crime was unable to secure additional information about the case because the clerk of court\\u2019s office was closed for the aforementioned reason.\\n\\n[Images of the victims via the FBI; image of the suspect via the Indiana State Police.]\\n\\n[Editor\\u2019s note: this report has been updated to reference WXIN\\u2019s story which suggests the bail amount listed in court records is not accurate. The headline has also been updated accordingly.]\",\n          \"According to gun control activists, the only (or at least the best) way to combat violent crime is by creating more non-violent, possessory criminal offenses involving firearms. Every call to \\u201cdo something\\u201d is, in reality, a demand to put more laws on the books; a cycle that inevitably repeats itself when those new laws fail to curb violent criminal activity.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, what about all the existing laws in place? Oh sure, gun control activists will complain when \\u201cred flag\\u201d laws aren\\u2019t used, but it\\u2019s exceedingly rare for gun control organizations or even individual activists to ever object when light sentences are handed down for violating laws that are already in place.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been writing quite a bit, for instance, about the growing number of auto sears that authorities say are popping up around the country. The small devices, which are either smuggled in from China or produced on 3D printers domestically, illegally modify semi-automatic handguns and rifles to shoot multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. Possession of these devices is a federal crime, as well as illegal under most state law, and those convicted in federal court can receive up to ten years in prison.\\n\\nTwo brothers from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area who were caught in possession of illegally modified handguns didn\\u2019t receive a ten-year term, however. In fact, when they were prosecuted in Hennepin County, Minnesota they got off with minor consequences. Unsurprisingly, the only lesson the pair learned from their first run-in with the law is that they had little to fear by breaking it.\\n\\nTwin brothers in the metro area have pleaded guilty after they were found to be in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition while being on probation for a separate weapons conviction, according to officials. The U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office says Quantez Demarco Ward and Cortez Demario Ward, both 19 years old, pleaded guilty on Monday to illegal possession of a firearm as a felon and illegal possession of ammunition as a felon, respectively. At the beginning of the year, both brothers were charged in Hennepin County District Court for modifying firearms with auto sears. They pleaded guilty to those charges and were released on terms of probation, court documents show.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter they were released on probation, the Wards were pulled over for a traffic stop in Maple Grove, Minnesota. Officers discovered Cortez Ward carrying a 9mm pistol, and apparently this time around local authorities brought in the feds. Two months later their home was the subject of a federal search warrant that turned up multiple firearms as well as ammunition, and the two men were charged in U.S. District Court, where they recently accepted a guilty plea.\\n\\nThe brothers haven\\u2019t been sentenced yet, but I suspect this time around they\\u2019ll get several years in a federal penitentiary as opposed to the slap on the wrist they received in Hennepin County District Court.\\n\\nYou\\u2019d think this would be the type of case that would have gun control activists raising hell, but there\\u2019s been nothing but silence, even from locals in the Twin Cities. Two teenagers caught illegally carrying guns that they\\u2019d illegally modified to turn into machine guns get probation, and not even a peep from the crowd routinely demanding that concealed carry licensees face felony charges if they so much as set foot into a designated \\u201csensitive place\\u201d?\\n\\nViolent crime has been rising in Hennepin County, as it has across much of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in the years since the riots over the murder of George Floyd. And yet when prosecutors and a judge allow the Wards to not only receive probation for their original crime, but to apparently avoid being sent to jail after Cortez Ward was once again discovered with a gun just a few months later, the gun control lobby is mum; demanding neither action nor accountability from the criminal justice system. Instead, they remain laser-focused on infringing on the rights of peaceable gun owners; including trying to convince the Biden administration to impose a gun ban through regulation, not legislation.\",\n          \"Archinect Jobs Visualizer\\n\\nA new way to view job opportunities, with\\n\\na focus on the work by hiring companies.\\n\\nGet a better look at the kind of projects\\n\\nyou could be working on.\\n\\n\\u2192\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Law&Crime has cross-referenced the terse and unilluminating docket entries to shed some light on the case.\\n\\nThe entries do not currently list a defense attorney for Allen, but they do say he\\u2019s being held on the aforementioned $20 million bond in \\u201ccash or corporate surety.\\u201d It had previously been reported that Allen was being held without bond.\\n\\nCiting the local prosecutor\\u2019s office and the local sheriff\\u2019s department, Indianapolis FOX affiliate WXIN reported Wednesday evening that the bond entry was some kind of error, but the prosecutor\\u2019s office never returned Law&Crime calls to confirm the dollar amount listed on the docket when we inquired about it earlier Wednesday afternoon. Nor was Law&Crime able to reach the Carroll County Clerk of Court\\u2019s office; it is closed as a matter of usual business on Wednesday afternoons. The Clerk of Court\\u2019s office previously told Law&Crime on Tuesday that it considered the online docket to be the best source of information about the matter going forward.\\n\\nA smattering of other entries in the case docket are dated Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, when news leaked out that Allen had been arrested. It is on that date that the prosecution formally was opened and a \\u201cverified request to prohibit public access\\u201d to the records was filed. An immediate order issued by Carroll County Circuit Judge Benjamin A. Diener sealed various records in the case.\\n\\nThe information and a probable cause affidavit \\u2014 both of which Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas C. McLeland said on Monday would remain sealed \\u2014 were also filed on Oct. 28.\\n\\nMcLeland and the state police announced on Monday that the charges are in connection with the deaths of Liberty \\u201cLibby\\u201d German, 14, and her best friend Abigail \\u201cAbby\\u201d Williams, 13. The young teens vanished while walking the Monon High Bridge Trail near Delphi, Indiana, on Feb. 13, 2017. The trail traverses an abandoned stretch of the old Monon Railroad and crosses a tall trestle.\\n\\nThe court docket indicates, as McLeland previously announced, that Allen is charged with two counts of murder. Until now, we didn\\u2019t know precisely which subsection of Indiana\\u2019s murder charge was at play. The docket says Allen is charged with murder under Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(2), which is a murder involving a specific underlying criminal offense.\\n\\nBasic Murder Law in Indiana\\n\\nBy way of comparison, let\\u2019s start with Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(1), the Hoosier State\\u2019s basic murder statute. It defines and criminalizes murder as having occurred when a person \\u201cknowingly or intentionally kills another human being.\\u201d Those words are brief, but the reality is more complex \\u2014 perhaps explaining why prosecutors did not choose this particular option in Allen\\u2019s case.\\n\\nTo secure a conviction on the basic charge, according to Indiana\\u2019s model jury instructions, the state must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim in a (4) knowing and intentional matter.\\n\\nThat might sound simple, but at times, it is not.\\n\\nProving the fourth element can sometimes be vexing. A review of a few Indiana criminal appeals suggests that convicted defendants do litigate the issue of whether prosecutors proved their crimes were \\u201cknowingly or intentionally\\u201d committed \\u2014 especially in cases which involve an accomplice or a theory of accomplice liability.\\n\\nPlus, in Indiana, voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense to murder, and the model jury instructions suggest that it can operate as somewhat of a default when coupled to a murder charge. Voluntary manslaughter involves a killing committed in \\u201csudden heat.\\u201d The jury instructions say the state has to prove a lack of \\u201csudden heat\\u201d to convict an individual of murder. If the state fails to prove that sudden heat did not exist, manslaughter is proven, and the jury default to that count, the model jury instructions indicate.\\n\\nMurder During Another Crime\\n\\nThat background is important as we look toward the charge the docket says Allen actually is facing. It\\u2019s verbose, but in some ways it is less complex.\\n\\nThe specific charge being alleged against Allen applies when a defendant:\\n\\n(2) kills another human being while committing or attempting to commit arson, burglary, child molesting, consumer product tampering, criminal deviate conduct (under IC 35-42-4-2 before its repeal [this involves deviate sexual conduct]), kidnapping, rape, robbery, human trafficking, promotion of human labor trafficking, promotion of human sexual trafficking, promotion of child sexual trafficking, promotion of sexual trafficking of a younger child, child sexual trafficking, or carjacking (before its repeal)[.]\\n\\nIt is unclear from the docket precisely which underlying offense or offenses is alleged in the Delphi case \\u2014 but the list of possibilities contained within the statute is harrowing.\\n\\nIt is possible that kidnapping is alleged because the authorities long ago publicized a brief video clip recorded by Libby German of someone saying \\u201cguys, down the hill.\\u201d Most of the clip has never been made public, nor have many other details about the grim case. But, again, the docket is silent as to the specifics.\\n\\nRegardless of which underlying offense is at play, the murder charges \\u2014 as they are currently listed under Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(2) \\u2014 will require prosecutors to prove as follows: (1) that the named defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim (4) while \\u201ccommitting or attempting to commit\\u201d the underlying offense.\\n\\nAnd that might be easier, depending on the facts of the case. It appears from the statutes themselves and from the model jury instructions that prosecutors will not have to dance around proving a lack of \\u201csudden heat\\u201d (should the lesser-included offense come into the equation). Nor will prosecutors have to negotiate the minefield of proving that the deaths themselves were knowing or intentional.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, statues such as the one cited in Allen\\u2019s docket require prosecutors only to prove that deaths occurred during the commission of an underlying offense \\u2014 even unintentionally. Again, depending on the facts of the case, that burden can oftentimes be easier for the state to carry.\\n\\nThe decision of which charge to apply to a case is strategic, and here, prosecutors aren\\u2019t saying much. Beyond announcing the charges and indicating that the case file itself remains sealed, they\\u2019ve remained tight lipped. McLeland\\u2019s office has refused to return Law&Crime\\u2019s phone calls even to confirm whether the bail amount is indeed accurate.\\n\\nAdditional Details\\n\\nAccording to the newly revealed docket, initial hearing for Allen was held on Friday, Oct. 28, at 10:30 a.m.\\n\\nThe docket also reveals \\u2014 for the first time \\u2014 when Judge Diener will hold a hearing to ascertain whether any of the currently sealed records in the case will be made public. That hearing is slated for Nov. 22, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., the docket says.\\n\\nAs prosecutors previously announced, a pretrial conference is scheduled for Jan. 13, 2023, at 9 a.m.\\n\\nA jury trial in the matter is currently scheduled to last five days. It\\u2019s scheduled to begin on March 20, 2023, and to conclude on March 24, 2023. It\\u2019s rare that a trial date scheduled this early in a proceeding would, indeed, occur on time, but it does happen from time to time. Much will depend on whether Allen waives his right to a speedy trial or enforces that constitutional right.\\n\\nUnder Indiana Criminal Procedure Rule 4, defendants can file a motion for an \\u201cearly trial.\\u201d If such a motion is filed, trial must be held within 70 days of the date of the request. That same rule also contemplates that a criminal trial be held within six months of an arrest \\u2014 though defendants can request delays, usually so their attorneys can examine evidence and mount a defense.\\n\\nLaw&Crime was unable to secure additional information about the case because the clerk of court\\u2019s office was closed for the aforementioned reason.\\n\\n[Images of the victims via the FBI; image of the suspect via the Indiana State Police.]\\n\\n[Editor\\u2019s note: this report has been updated to reference WXIN\\u2019s story which suggests the bail amount listed in court records is not accurate. The headline has also been updated accordingly.]\",\n          \"According to gun control activists, the only (or at least the best) way to combat violent crime is by creating more non-violent, possessory criminal offenses involving firearms. Every call to \\u201cdo something\\u201d is, in reality, a demand to put more laws on the books; a cycle that inevitably repeats itself when those new laws fail to curb violent criminal activity.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, what about all the existing laws in place? Oh sure, gun control activists will complain when \\u201cred flag\\u201d laws aren\\u2019t used, but it\\u2019s exceedingly rare for gun control organizations or even individual activists to ever object when light sentences are handed down for violating laws that are already in place.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been writing quite a bit, for instance, about the growing number of auto sears that authorities say are popping up around the country. The small devices, which are either smuggled in from China or produced on 3D printers domestically, illegally modify semi-automatic handguns and rifles to shoot multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. Possession of these devices is a federal crime, as well as illegal under most state law, and those convicted in federal court can receive up to ten years in prison.\\n\\nTwo brothers from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area who were caught in possession of illegally modified handguns didn\\u2019t receive a ten-year term, however. In fact, when they were prosecuted in Hennepin County, Minnesota they got off with minor consequences. Unsurprisingly, the only lesson the pair learned from their first run-in with the law is that they had little to fear by breaking it.\\n\\nTwin brothers in the metro area have pleaded guilty after they were found to be in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition while being on probation for a separate weapons conviction, according to officials. The U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office says Quantez Demarco Ward and Cortez Demario Ward, both 19 years old, pleaded guilty on Monday to illegal possession of a firearm as a felon and illegal possession of ammunition as a felon, respectively. At the beginning of the year, both brothers were charged in Hennepin County District Court for modifying firearms with auto sears. They pleaded guilty to those charges and were released on terms of probation, court documents show.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter they were released on probation, the Wards were pulled over for a traffic stop in Maple Grove, Minnesota. Officers discovered Cortez Ward carrying a 9mm pistol, and apparently this time around local authorities brought in the feds. Two months later their home was the subject of a federal search warrant that turned up multiple firearms as well as ammunition, and the two men were charged in U.S. District Court, where they recently accepted a guilty plea.\\n\\nThe brothers haven\\u2019t been sentenced yet, but I suspect this time around they\\u2019ll get several years in a federal penitentiary as opposed to the slap on the wrist they received in Hennepin County District Court.\\n\\nYou\\u2019d think this would be the type of case that would have gun control activists raising hell, but there\\u2019s been nothing but silence, even from locals in the Twin Cities. Two teenagers caught illegally carrying guns that they\\u2019d illegally modified to turn into machine guns get probation, and not even a peep from the crowd routinely demanding that concealed carry licensees face felony charges if they so much as set foot into a designated \\u201csensitive place\\u201d?\\n\\nViolent crime has been rising in Hennepin County, as it has across much of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in the years since the riots over the murder of George Floyd. And yet when prosecutors and a judge allow the Wards to not only receive probation for their original crime, but to apparently avoid being sent to jail after Cortez Ward was once again discovered with a gun just a few months later, the gun control lobby is mum; demanding neither action nor accountability from the criminal justice system. Instead, they remain laser-focused on infringing on the rights of peaceable gun owners; including trying to convince the Biden administration to impose a gun ban through regulation, not legislation.\",\n          \"A flyer seeking information about the killings of four University of Idaho students who were found dead is displayed on a table along with buttons and bracelets during a vigil in memory of the victims in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 30, 2022.\\n\\nA flyer seeking information about the killings of four University of Idaho students who were found dead is displayed on a table along with buttons and bracelets during a vigil in memory of the victims in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 30, 2022.

However, it doesn\\u2019t alter the outcome or alleviate the pain,\\u201d Chapin\\u2019s family said in a statement to ABC after his arrest. \\u201cWe miss Ethan, and our family is forever changed.\\u201d\\n\\nXana Kernodle\\u2019s cousin, Sheldon Kernodle, urged people to come forward with more information. \\u201cOur work isn\\u2019t done yet,\\u201d he wrote on social media.\\n\\nBryan Kohberger. (Monroe County (Pa.) Correctional Facility via AP)\\n\\nOther Details In his interview with the network, LaBar said he did not discuss the murder charges and did not have probable cause documents in connection to the case. LaBar said he is only representing Kohberger in connection to his extradition from Pennsylvania to Idaho.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a procedural issue, and really all the Commonwealth here has to prove is that he resembles or is the person who the arrest warrant is out for and that he was in the area at the time of the crime,\\u201d LaBar said . The attorney, meanwhile, said that waiving the extradition was \\u201can easy decision\\u201d because \\u201che doesn\\u2019t contest that he is Bryan Kohberger.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMr. Kohberger is eager to be exonerated of these charges and looks forward to resolving these matters as promptly as possible,\\u201d LaBar also said, adding that his client should be presumed innocent until he is proven guilty. Since his arrest in Pennsylvania, there have been numerous unconfirmed reports from the New York Post and Daily Mail tabloids\\u2014citing unnamed sources\\u2014about Kohberger and his possible motives.\\n\\nOfficials in Moscow, Idaho, on Dec. 30 held a news conference that named Kohberger as the primary suspect in the case, coming weeks after the murders were reported. For weeks, investigators said they were baffled by the case and frequently asked the public for help in providing possible clues, and by mid-December, investigators were working through nearly 12,000 tips and had identified more than 22,000 vehicles matching that make and model.\\n\\nThe killings initially mystified law enforcement and shook the small town of Moscow a community of about 25,000 people that had not had a murder for five years. Fears of a repeat attack prompted nearly half of the University of Idaho\\u2019s more than 11,000 students to leave the city and switch to online classes.\\n\\nLatah County prosecutor Bill Thompson confirmed a criminal complaint was filed against Kohberger with four counts of murder and other charges in connection to the case. An affidavit has been sealed until Kohberger returns to Idaho, he said.\\n\\n\\u201cOnce he gets here, he will have an initial appearance with a magistrate,\\u201d Thompson said.\\n\\nA day later, Moscow Police Department Captain Anthony Dahlinger told The Associated Press that \\u201cwe believe we\\u2019ve got our man.\\u201d Investigators obtained samples of Kohberger\\u2019s DNA directly from the suspect after he was arrested, Dahlinger said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s the one that we believe is responsible for all four of the murders,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nKohberger graduated from Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania with an associate of arts degree in psychology in 2018, according to college spokesperson Mia Rossi-Marino. A Ph.D. student with the same name is listed in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Washington State University, which is a short drive across the state line from the University of Idaho.\\n\\nDeSales University in Pennsylvania confirmed that a student by that name received a bachelor\\u2019s degree in 2020 and completed graduate studies in June 2022.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Law&Crime has cross-referenced the terse and unilluminating docket entries to shed some light on the case.\\n\\nThe entries do not currently list a defense attorney for Allen, but they do say he\\u2019s being held on the aforementioned $20 million bond in \\u201ccash or corporate surety.\\u201d It had previously been reported that Allen was being held without bond.\\n\\nCiting the local prosecutor\\u2019s office and the local sheriff\\u2019s department, Indianapolis FOX affiliate WXIN reported Wednesday evening that the bond entry was some kind of error, but the prosecutor\\u2019s office never returned Law&Crime calls to confirm the dollar amount listed on the docket when we inquired about it earlier Wednesday afternoon. Nor was Law&Crime able to reach the Carroll County Clerk of Court\\u2019s office; it is closed as a matter of usual business on Wednesday afternoons. The Clerk of Court\\u2019s office previously told Law&Crime on Tuesday that it considered the online docket to be the best source of information about the matter going forward.\\n\\nA smattering of other entries in the case docket are dated Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, when news leaked out that Allen had been arrested. It is on that date that the prosecution formally was opened and a \\u201cverified request to prohibit public access\\u201d to the records was filed. An immediate order issued by Carroll County Circuit Judge Benjamin A. Diener sealed various records in the case.\\n\\nThe information and a probable cause affidavit \\u2014 both of which Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas C. McLeland said on Monday would remain sealed \\u2014 were also filed on Oct. 28.\\n\\nMcLeland and the state police announced on Monday that the charges are in connection with the deaths of Liberty \\u201cLibby\\u201d German, 14, and her best friend Abigail \\u201cAbby\\u201d Williams, 13. The young teens vanished while walking the Monon High Bridge Trail near Delphi, Indiana, on Feb. 13, 2017. The trail traverses an abandoned stretch of the old Monon Railroad and crosses a tall trestle.\\n\\nThe court docket indicates, as McLeland previously announced, that Allen is charged with two counts of murder. Until now, we didn\\u2019t know precisely which subsection of Indiana\\u2019s murder charge was at play. The docket says Allen is charged with murder under Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(2), which is a murder involving a specific underlying criminal offense.\\n\\nBasic Murder Law in Indiana\\n\\nBy way of comparison, let\\u2019s start with Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(1), the Hoosier State\\u2019s basic murder statute. It defines and criminalizes murder as having occurred when a person \\u201cknowingly or intentionally kills another human being.\\u201d Those words are brief, but the reality is more complex \\u2014 perhaps explaining why prosecutors did not choose this particular option in Allen\\u2019s case.\\n\\nTo secure a conviction on the basic charge, according to Indiana\\u2019s model jury instructions, the state must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim in a (4) knowing and intentional matter.\\n\\nThat might sound simple, but at times, it is not.\\n\\nProving the fourth element can sometimes be vexing. A review of a few Indiana criminal appeals suggests that convicted defendants do litigate the issue of whether prosecutors proved their crimes were \\u201cknowingly or intentionally\\u201d committed \\u2014 especially in cases which involve an accomplice or a theory of accomplice liability.\\n\\nPlus, in Indiana, voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense to murder, and the model jury instructions suggest that it can operate as somewhat of a default when coupled to a murder charge. Voluntary manslaughter involves a killing committed in \\u201csudden heat.\\u201d The jury instructions say the state has to prove a lack of \\u201csudden heat\\u201d to convict an individual of murder. If the state fails to prove that sudden heat did not exist, manslaughter is proven, and the jury default to that count, the model jury instructions indicate.\\n\\nMurder During Another Crime\\n\\nThat background is important as we look toward the charge the docket says Allen actually is facing. It\\u2019s verbose, but in some ways it is less complex.\\n\\nThe specific charge being alleged against Allen applies when a defendant:\\n\\n(2) kills another human being while committing or attempting to commit arson, burglary, child molesting, consumer product tampering, criminal deviate conduct (under IC 35-42-4-2 before its repeal [this involves deviate sexual conduct]), kidnapping, rape, robbery, human trafficking, promotion of human labor trafficking, promotion of human sexual trafficking, promotion of child sexual trafficking, promotion of sexual trafficking of a younger child, child sexual trafficking, or carjacking (before its repeal)[.]\\n\\nIt is unclear from the docket precisely which underlying offense or offenses is alleged in the Delphi case \\u2014 but the list of possibilities contained within the statute is harrowing.\\n\\nIt is possible that kidnapping is alleged because the authorities long ago publicized a brief video clip recorded by Libby German of someone saying \\u201cguys, down the hill.\\u201d Most of the clip has never been made public, nor have many other details about the grim case. But, again, the docket is silent as to the specifics.\\n\\nRegardless of which underlying offense is at play, the murder charges \\u2014 as they are currently listed under Ind. Code \\u00a7 35-42-1-1(2) \\u2014 will require prosecutors to prove as follows: (1) that the named defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim (4) while \\u201ccommitting or attempting to commit\\u201d the underlying offense.\\n\\nAnd that might be easier, depending on the facts of the case. It appears from the statutes themselves and from the model jury instructions that prosecutors will not have to dance around proving a lack of \\u201csudden heat\\u201d (should the lesser-included offense come into the equation). Nor will prosecutors have to negotiate the minefield of proving that the deaths themselves were knowing or intentional.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, statues such as the one cited in Allen\\u2019s docket require prosecutors only to prove that deaths occurred during the commission of an underlying offense \\u2014 even unintentionally. Again, depending on the facts of the case, that burden can oftentimes be easier for the state to carry.\\n\\nThe decision of which charge to apply to a case is strategic, and here, prosecutors aren\\u2019t saying much. Beyond announcing the charges and indicating that the case file itself remains sealed, they\\u2019ve remained tight lipped. McLeland\\u2019s office has refused to return Law&Crime\\u2019s phone calls even to confirm whether the bail amount is indeed accurate.\\n\\nAdditional Details\\n\\nAccording to the newly revealed docket, initial hearing for Allen was held on Friday, Oct. 28, at 10:30 a.m.\\n\\nThe docket also reveals \\u2014 for the first time \\u2014 when Judge Diener will hold a hearing to ascertain whether any of the currently sealed records in the case will be made public. That hearing is slated for Nov. 22, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., the docket says.\\n\\nAs prosecutors previously announced, a pretrial conference is scheduled for Jan. 13, 2023, at 9 a.m.\\n\\nA jury trial in the matter is currently scheduled to last five days. It\\u2019s scheduled to begin on March 20, 2023, and to conclude on March 24, 2023. It\\u2019s rare that a trial date scheduled this early in a proceeding would, indeed, occur on time, but it does happen from time to time. Much will depend on whether Allen waives his right to a speedy trial or enforces that constitutional right.\\n\\nUnder Indiana Criminal Procedure Rule 4, defendants can file a motion for an \\u201cearly trial.\\u201d If such a motion is filed, trial must be held within 70 days of the date of the request. That same rule also contemplates that a criminal trial be held within six months of an arrest \\u2014 though defendants can request delays, usually so their attorneys can examine evidence and mount a defense.\\n\\nLaw&Crime was unable to secure additional information about the case because the clerk of court\\u2019s office was closed for the aforementioned reason.\\n\\n[Images of the victims via the FBI; image of the suspect via the Indiana State Police.]\\n\\n[Editor\\u2019s note: this report has been updated to reference WXIN\\u2019s story which suggests the bail amount listed in court records is not accurate. The headline has also been updated accordingly.]\",\n          \"According to gun control activists, the only (or at least the best) way to combat violent crime is by creating more non-violent, possessory criminal offenses involving firearms. Every call to \\u201cdo something\\u201d is, in reality, a demand to put more laws on the books; a cycle that inevitably repeats itself when those new laws fail to curb violent criminal activity.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, what about all the existing laws in place? Oh sure, gun control activists will complain when \\u201cred flag\\u201d laws aren\\u2019t used, but it\\u2019s exceedingly rare for gun control organizations or even individual activists to ever object when light sentences are handed down for violating laws that are already in place.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been writing quite a bit, for instance, about the growing number of auto sears that authorities say are popping up around the country. The small devices, which are either smuggled in from China or produced on 3D printers domestically, illegally modify semi-automatic handguns and rifles to shoot multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. Possession of these devices is a federal crime, as well as illegal under most state law, and those convicted in federal court can receive up to ten years in prison.\\n\\nTwo brothers from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area who were caught in possession of illegally modified handguns didn\\u2019t receive a ten-year term, however. In fact, when they were prosecuted in Hennepin County, Minnesota they got off with minor consequences. Unsurprisingly, the only lesson the pair learned from their first run-in with the law is that they had little to fear by breaking it.\\n\\nTwin brothers in the metro area have pleaded guilty after they were found to be in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition while being on probation for a separate weapons conviction, according to officials. The U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office says Quantez Demarco Ward and Cortez Demario Ward, both 19 years old, pleaded guilty on Monday to illegal possession of a firearm as a felon and illegal possession of ammunition as a felon, respectively. At the beginning of the year, both brothers were charged in Hennepin County District Court for modifying firearms with auto sears. They pleaded guilty to those charges and were released on terms of probation, court documents show.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter they were released on probation, the Wards were pulled over for a traffic stop in Maple Grove, Minnesota. Officers discovered Cortez Ward carrying a 9mm pistol, and apparently this time around local authorities brought in the feds. Two months later their home was the subject of a federal search warrant that turned up multiple firearms as well as ammunition, and the two men were charged in U.S. District Court, where they recently accepted a guilty plea.\\n\\nThe brothers haven\\u2019t been sentenced yet, but I suspect this time around they\\u2019ll get several years in a federal penitentiary as opposed to the slap on the wrist they received in Hennepin County District Court.\\n\\nYou\\u2019d think this would be the type of case that would have gun control activists raising hell, but there\\u2019s been nothing but silence, even from locals in the Twin Cities. Two teenagers caught illegally carrying guns that they\\u2019d illegally modified to turn into machine guns get probation, and not even a peep from the crowd routinely demanding that concealed carry licensees face felony charges if they so much as set foot into a designated \\u201csensitive place\\u201d?\\n\\nViolent crime has been rising in Hennepin County, as it has across much of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in the years since the riots over the murder of George Floyd. And yet when prosecutors and a judge allow the Wards to not only receive probation for their original crime, but to apparently avoid being sent to jail after Cortez Ward was once again discovered with a gun just a few months later, the gun control lobby is mum; demanding neither action nor accountability from the criminal justice system. Instead, they remain laser-focused on infringing on the rights of peaceable gun owners; including trying to convince the Biden administration to impose a gun ban through regulation, not legislation.\",\n          \"A flyer seeking information about the killings of four University of Idaho students who were found dead is displayed on a table along with buttons and bracelets during a vigil in memory of the victims in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 30, 2022.\\n\\nA flyer seeking information about the killings of four University of Idaho students who were found dead is displayed on a table along with buttons and bracelets during a vigil in memory of the victims in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 30, 2022. Ted S. Warren/AP Photo\\n\\nThe family members of four Idaho college students who were killed in November released statements after officials said a suspect, Bryan Christopher Kohberger, was arrested late last week.\\n\\nAfter Kohberger\\u2019s arrest, Steve Goncalves, victim Kaylee Goncalves\\u2019s father, said he saw links between Kohberger and his daughter, a lawyer for the family told ABC News. Nobody in the family recognized the suspect, the lawyer said, adding that he wouldn\\u2019t elaborate on the alleged connections.\\n\\n\\u201cNow that there\\u2019s a person and a name that someone can specifically look for and see if there\\u2019s any connections in any way. So they\\u2019re just trying to figure it out,\\u201d family attorney Shanon Grey told ABC News.\\n\\nJason LaBar, the chief public defender for Monroe County, Pennsylvania, told CNN that Kohberger is \\u201cshocked a little bit\\u201d after he was arrested last week at his home in connection to the killing of Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, in November. LaBar said Kohberger would waive his extradition this week to expedite his return to Idaho.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are relieved this chapter is over because it provides a form of closure. However, it doesn\\u2019t alter the outcome or alleviate the pain,\\u201d Chapin\\u2019s family said in a statement to ABC after his arrest. \\u201cWe miss Ethan, and our family is forever changed.\\u201d\\n\\nXana Kernodle\\u2019s cousin, Sheldon Kernodle, urged people to come forward with more information. \\u201cOur work isn\\u2019t done yet,\\u201d he wrote on social media.\\n\\nBryan Kohberger. (Monroe County (Pa.) Correctional Facility via AP)\\n\\nOther Details In his interview with the network, LaBar said he did not discuss the murder charges and did not have probable cause documents in connection to the case. LaBar said he is only representing Kohberger in connection to his extradition from Pennsylvania to Idaho.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a procedural issue, and really all the Commonwealth here has to prove is that he resembles or is the person who the arrest warrant is out for and that he was in the area at the time of the crime,\\u201d LaBar said . The attorney, meanwhile, said that waiving the extradition was \\u201can easy decision\\u201d because \\u201che doesn\\u2019t contest that he is Bryan Kohberger.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMr. Kohberger is eager to be exonerated of these charges and looks forward to resolving these matters as promptly as possible,\\u201d LaBar also said, adding that his client should be presumed innocent until he is proven guilty. Since his arrest in Pennsylvania, there have been numerous unconfirmed reports from the New York Post and Daily Mail tabloids\\u2014citing unnamed sources\\u2014about Kohberger and his possible motives.\\n\\nOfficials in Moscow, Idaho, on Dec. 30 held a news conference that named Kohberger as the primary suspect in the case, coming weeks after the murders were reported. For weeks, investigators said they were baffled by the case and frequently asked the public for help in providing possible clues, and by mid-December, investigators were working through nearly 12,000 tips and had identified more than 22,000 vehicles matching that make and model.\\n\\nThe killings initially mystified law enforcement and shook the small town of Moscow a community of about 25,000 people that had not had a murder for five years. Fears of a repeat attack prompted nearly half of the University of Idaho\\u2019s more than 11,000 students to leave the city and switch to online classes.\\n\\nLatah County prosecutor Bill Thompson confirmed a criminal complaint was filed against Kohberger with four counts of murder and other charges in connection to the case. An affidavit has been sealed until Kohberger returns to Idaho, he said.\\n\\n\\u201cOnce he gets here, he will have an initial appearance with a magistrate,\\u201d Thompson said.\\n\\nA day later, Moscow Police Department Captain Anthony Dahlinger told The Associated Press that \\u201cwe believe we\\u2019ve got our man.\\u201d Investigators obtained samples of Kohberger\\u2019s DNA directly from the suspect after he was arrested, Dahlinger said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s the one that we believe is responsible for all four of the murders,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nKohberger graduated from Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania with an associate of arts degree in psychology in 2018, according to college spokesperson Mia Rossi-Marino. A Ph.D. student with the same name is listed in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Washington State University, which is a short drive across the state line from the University of Idaho.\\n\\nDeSales University in Pennsylvania confirmed that a student by that name received a bachelor\\u2019s degree in 2020 and completed graduate studies in June 2022.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"news_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
