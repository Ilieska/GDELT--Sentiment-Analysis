Earlier this month, the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council, the FAR Council, finalized new, more stringent rules for U.S. content in what agencies buy. But the whole regime is not quite as strict as it might seem at first glance. For what it does mean to contracting officers and to contractors, the Federal Drive with Tom Temin turned to a partner and the head of the contracts group at the law firm Miller and Chevalier, Jason Workmaster.

Interview transcript:

Tom Temin: Mr. Workmaster, good to have you back.

Jason Workmaster: Oh, it’s a pleasure to be here, Tom, thanks so much for having me back.

Tom Temin: And you have written extensively about this. What do we take away from all of this because things are either made in the United States or they’re not. And it’s not as if the United States has been buying all of its shells from China, that they fire at the Russians or something, but tell us what this all means.

Jason Workmaster: All of this domestic preference stuff goes way back, back even to the 1930s. There’s always been, this strain within government procurement, that we want to buy stuff that’s made America to the greatest extent possible. And these various rules and regulations have been around for a while to codify that concept. But one thing that’s important, right off the bat to note, with all this stuff – I’ll talk some more about the specifics of the various statutes that are out there. But just to set the stage here, the Buy America stuff is only one piece of the puzzle. We have a lot of trade agreements with a lot of countries around the world, where the basic premise of those is, those other countries that we have trade agreements with, they get to participate in the government procurement market, just like an American company. And so, the Trade Agreements Act is another statute that’s out there. And that regime where American companies and American goods are basically on par with goods that are made overseas, that regime governs the vast majority of procurements by the federal government. Again, they’re subject to treaties, treaties are on the same par as like a Constitution itself. So it’s important to remember that. There’s been a lot of talk about Buy America. But it’s important to note, if you’re a federal contractor out there, by and large, if you’re in a procurement, that’s $170,000, $180,000 or more, you’re not going to be dealing with Buy America, you’re going to be on the same playing field as all of our trading partners. Now, it’s important to note, one of those trading partners that we’re signed up to is not China, it’s not India. So those goods are not subjects you’re not competing on the same playing field.

Tom Temin: What about Japan?

Jason Workmaster: Japan is, Japan and the U.K. And you think of Western Europe, Australia, there’s lots of countries that are on there called designated countries, lots of countries on the designated countries list that you’re on par with, under our trade agreements. That’s kind of setting the stage. All that said, there has been a lot of focus on Buy American, which is Buy “Ameri-can,” that goes back to the ’30s. And another thing that’s important to note here, when Buy American, which applies to federal procurements, or Buy “Ameri-ca” – so it’s gets very confusing quickly – Buy America applies to highways, Department of Transportation, where the money is federal money. So you think about the recent infrastructure bill, that money is going to go down to the states, and the states are actually going to use that money to conduct the procurements. Now it’s going to come with federal strings attached to it. And one of those is going to be Buy America. But in both that world, and in federal procurement, when you’re under that $180,000 bucks, and you’re subject to Buy American, it’s only a price preference. It doesn’t prohibit the government from buying. This is another thing that gets kind of lost when you hear people talk about this, it doesn’t actually prohibit the government from buying non-American stuff. What it does is it establishes it when the government goes to evaluate price, it gives the American-made product a price preference. And so when the government’s of making making its evaluation decision, the American-made good is going to have a 20, 30 if it’s a small business, it’s gonna have a price preference when the government’s doing its evaluation. But it is not a strict prohibition.

Tom Temin: So this is all a balancing among then, first, the size of the contract and what laws actually apply, then this pricing belay, and then you have to avoid certain countries, period, because they’re evil countries or –

Jason Workmaster: Right, right.

Tom Temin: All right. Well, that’s good groundwork. We’re speaking with Jason Workmaster. He’s a partner and the head of the contracts group at the law firm Miller and Chevalier. So does this practically change anything? Well, let me ask you about this, let me ask you specific: in the infrastructure bill, states will be building, they say, bridges and so forth. A lot of infrastructure is built with not only steel structures, but premade steel construction elements, like when they built the ballpark. They built whole stands preassembled, came on a ship already bolted together from Korea. What does the infrastructure bill have to do now, if people are buying components that are semi finished out of, say, steel I beams for some piece of infrastructure?

Jason Workmaster: So for the infrastructure work again, you’re going to be dealing with a lot of money there, that’s going to be given to the states to grants from the Department of Transportation. So that in general means you’re going to be dealing with the Buy America regime. And in general, that regime requires the recipients’ federal money from DOT to purchase U.S.-produced steel, iron, and Tom, to your point, manufactured products. And now the specific list of what that’s going to be, that’s going to be tied to exactly what grant, and who’s administering the money. I mean, it’s gonna get more complicated than that. But as a general proposition, the price preference here is going to apply to manufactured products, the kind you were just mentioning, in addition to like raw materials, like iron and steel.

Tom Temin: Right, because someone could buy half of a bridge pre-made and buy the two halves and just weld them together on site, as opposed to building it like an erector set where you buy all the little slice. And then there’s the labor and union requirement, but that’s another story.

Jason Workmaster: Right, that’s right. Exactly.

Tom Temin: And what about electronics? Because the government buys so much electronics and that’s always been a question, well, can I buy a Toshiba laptop? Because it’s Toshiba, but it might be assembled in China, where most of them are. So how does that all change if it does?

Jason Workmaster: Yeah, so IT procurements are not subject to this. Any of this stuff we’re talking about with Buy America, IT is not subject to these rules. Now, it is going to be subject, I talked about before trade agreements. And when you look across the past 20, 30 years, where the government has purchased, of course, a lot of IT, where folks get tripped up in that space. Again, I’m representing contractors, and there’s been actually a lot of litigation over the past few decades, a lot of IT is purchased through something called the GSA Schedules Program.

Tom Temin: Oh, yes.

Jason Workmaster: And that program is subject to the Trade Agreements Act requirements, which means you cannot sell from non-designated countries, one of which is the People’s Republic of China. And so, there that has generated a lot of litigation and investigations and that kind of stuff over the course of time, because, allegedly, Chinese-made goods have, snuck through the schedules, madke their way into the hands of government agencies. And so that is a problem. It’s not a Buy America problem, it’s a trade agreement set.

Tom Temin: Because you do see products from time to time that you would assume, are made in China, and are surprised sometimes to see they’re made in America. Pencils, for example, are made in the United States, I guess the government still buys a lot of pencils, whenever a pencil commodity costs?

Jason Workmaster: Right, well and that’s a good example. Pencils are something – when the threshold’s $170,000, $180,000 your pencil procurements are gonna be underneath that. I think it would be an unusual procurement where the government’s buying $250,000 worth of pencils. Those will be smaller purchases, and so the smaller purchases are going to be subject to Buy America. So it’s interesting what you’re just saying, Tom, I mean, where you see the supply chain of all these various products, it very much does kind of tie to, okay, is the procurement going to be under the threshold or over the threshold, because if it’s under the threshold, you are going to see more of a domestic industrial base.

Tom Temin: And when you get out of the office, though, of federal agencies and say get into the fleets where you might have a fleet of 100 cars or 500 cars or someday 200,000 electric postal vehicles and they all need new batteries, that’s going to be a multimillion-dollar purchase.

Jason Workmaster: That will, yes. Yeah then you’re going to be out of Buy America. You’re going to be in Trade Agreements Act land.

Tom Temin: Right. So it’s worthwhile for every nation that wants to sell the United States, the good guys that is, the Australias, that may be get into that business so they can sell brake pads and batteries to U.S. government fleets?

Jason Workmaster: Yes.

Tom Temin: So what advice are you giving contractors then?

Jason Workmaster: It is, and again, I mean, we put out advisories on it, all the government contracts shops have put out advisories. As you mentioned, the FAR Council put out a final rule just earlier this month, that is on the universe of procurements to which Buy American applies. It is going to make it more difficult to demonstrate that what you’re selling is made in America. So what it’s going to do is it’s going to increase – so the Buy American test, there’s a two part test. You have to demonstrate, the thing was “mined or manufactured” in the United States, and then you have to look at the cost of the components of the finished product. And currently, you have to demonstrate that 55% is domestic U.S. content. That is going to increase in October to 60%. So that domestic content requirement is going to go up. And then under this final rule, it’s going to keep going up to 65% by 2024, and then to 75% by 2029.

And so if you’re selling again, if my advice to contractors, look at your track record of the size [of] the procurements that you’re competing for, and if you’re competing for procurements that are, and it’s going to be easy to tell, if you’re subject to the Buy American requirements, you’re going to look at your solicitations, you’re going to see the Buy American clauses in your solicitation. So it shouldn’t be difficult to figure out if you’re playing in this world. And one other thing that’s important to note here, Tom, kind of, regardless, this is one thing, where there is for all the very many differences between the previous administration and this administration, this is one thing they actually agree on. Under the Trump administration, President Trump had taken a lot of steps towards increasing the requirements on Buy American. And that just continued under the Biden administration, it’s really been just very similar approach to this.

So kind of regardless of what happens in 2020, for next presidential election, or whatever, regardless of that, we don’t see this kind of stuff change, which actually makes things a little bit easier for contractors to deal with. Because unlike things like, we’ve done a lot of work on the vaccine mandates. That kind of stuff, it does make a huge difference who’s in the White House. This stuff it doesn’t. So it makes things a little bit easier for contractors to kind of have some predictability. And so on this one, again, unless something strange happens, we are going to see these increases. And so for contractors who are selling in that market, they need to be assessing now, if they haven’t already been. I mean, going back again, to the previous administration, we were telling folks even then you need this, this is coming, you need to be preparing for it. And so you need to be looking at where you’re sourcing your content from that goes into your finished product to make sure that you’re going to meet these ever increasing thresholds.

Tom Temin: Attorney Jason Workmaster heads the federal contracts group at Miller and Chevalier. Thanks so much for joining me.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/6/8/23160414/state-board-approves-sale-of-weiss-memorial-hospital-west-suburban-medical-center,"State board approves sale of Weiss Memorial Hospital, West Suburban Medical Center","The sale of Weiss Memorial Hospital in Uptown and West Suburban Medical Center in Oak Park cleared a major hurdle this week after a state review board approved the $92 million transaction.

The two hospitals were purchased three years ago by California-based Pipeline Health as part of a package deal and announced its plans to sell them to Michigan-based Resilience Healthcare in March.

Sitting members on the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board approved the sale 6-0 with three other board members not present for the vote. This paves the way for the sale to finalize, which is expected to happen over the next several weeks.

“It is clear to me that successful turnaround of these hospitals requires full time boots on the ground local system leadership,” Nick Orzano, founder and board member of Pipeline, said in a statement. “At the same time, these hospitals need strong public funding support to thrive — and this public funding can be maximized in Illinois only by an owner whom elected officials embrace.”

The newly created Resilience Healthcare is led by Manoj Prasad, a health care executive, with New Jersey-based businessman Rathnakar Patlola as a financial partner in Resilience.

“Rathnakar and I are very pleased that the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board approved our applications,” Prasad said in a statement. “We are excited to provide healthcare services to the communities served by West Suburban Medical Center and Weiss Hospital.”

Pipeline said it has made “significant investments” in the hospitals, which total $60 million. It also previously said it would refund $12 million to Resilience Healthcare from a separate deal to sell a parking lot at Weiss Memorial.

Irene Dumanis, CEO for Weiss Memorial, applauded the approval, saying the sale will only improve the quality of care the hospital provides.

“The two hospitals are in better shape now than when the previous Pipeline leadership team took ownership in 2019,” Dumanis said in a statement. “We are ready to move forward at Weiss as we celebrate the hospital’s 70th anniversary this summer.”

In 2019, Pipeline bought the hospitals in a package deal that included Weiss Memorial, West Suburban and Westlake Hospital in Melrose Park for $70 million from Tenet Healthcare.

The group quickly fell out of favor with residents and political leaders after announcing it would close Westlake despite promising to help improve the safety-net hospital’s services.

The looming closure sparked months of protests and a bitter legal battle between the village of Melrose Park and Pipeline. Several state leaders also got involved in the fight.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker ousted two state board appointees after it unanimously approved the closure of the hospital. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx joined the legal battle to keep the hospital open. Then former employees of Westlake filed a lawsuit against Pipeline, alleging the former owners violated U.S. labor laws.

Ultimately the fight was lost as Westlake filed for bankruptcy, saying it was losing nearly $3 million a month, which provided a pathway to closure.

The closure also helped create a new law that would make it easier for hospitals like Westlake to reopen.

Top of the Market

You Can’t Eat Prestige

If you could somehow see every biennial or triennial in the last five years, what patterns would emerge? Which stars would shine brightest?

These are the questions behind the Biennial Artist Project, a series from Artnet News on the stars of the biennial circuit. We examined the artist lists for 211 biennials and triennials held over the past five years to find out which artists are the most widely exhibited.

The research revealed not only a surprising cast of leading figures, but also several key distinctions between what our art critic Ben Davis dubbed Biennial World and Art Market World. Here’s what we found.

These Are Parallel Universes.

Biennial stars don’t at all correlate with art-market power rankings. There is almost no overlap between the under-40 stars who have emerged from the recent epoch of biennials—such as multimedia artist Korakrit Arunanondchai, video artist Uriel Orlow, and sound artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan—and those of the same generation who have become art-market darlings over the last five years (think: Amoako Boafo, Ivy Haldeman, Anna Weyant).

Biennial Stars Come From All Over—But They Congregate in a Few Spots.

A total of 1,599 artists have appeared in more than one of these big survey shows since the last Documenta in 2017. The majority come from outside of typical market centers, with a strong representation of diasporas stemming from Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Look closer, however, and a more traditional concentration of geographical power persists: Mapping out the places where the 75 top artists keep their studios, a little more than half work in Berlin, London, or New York.

The Biennial Star System Has Its Own Economy.

Most of the mega-galleries are entirely absent from the list of dealers who represent the top 30 biennial artists. The leaders are Mor Charpentier (which reps four of the top 30), König Galerie (three), and Tanya Bonakdar (three). Many of these dealers consider promoting biennial stars as its own kind of calling—but it’s not lucrative, especially at the start. “Money has never interested me really,” dealer Andrée Sfeir-Semler said. “We need it, but it is not our aim.”

The Bottom Line

There is a widespread assumption that inclusion in biennials will lead to sales for artists down the line. But the gulf between the mainstream art market and the biennial world shows that this assumption is deeply flawed. (Paris dealer Imane Fares even transfers money from her construction business to keep her biennial frequent fliers solvent.)

Certain commonalities among biennial stars help explain this phenomenon. They often focus on complex, critical themes such as climate change, politics, violence, and oppression. And they usually express these ideas through media that are difficult to display, including ambitious installations and multi-channel video works. The problem is that, now more than ever, dealers say, even once-ambitious buyers want painting, painting, and more painting.

For now, then, most biennial artists rely on a patchwork of support that includes government funding, public foundations, and private money, as well as dealers who are playing the long game. But these safety nets are fragile, and should they break, institutionally prized “biennial artists” will be left in the cold.

All this to say, if biennials do not find a way to adequately pay their participants, or scale back in number and size, their proliferation is actually a threat to the production of the work they purport to champion. All that will be left of this generation’s artistic output will be easy-to-digest paintings that make a splash at Art Basel or Christie’s. And that would be a bland future indeed.

https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/may/10/musk-says-he-would-reverse-twitters-ban-of-donald/,Musk says he would reverse Twitter's ban of Donald Trump,"LONDON — Elon Musk said he will reverse Twitter’s permanent ban of former President Donald Trump should the Tesla CEO conclude his deal to acquire the social media company for $44 billion.

Musk, speaking virtually at a Future of the Car summit hosted by the Financial Times, said Twitter’s Trump ban was a “morally bad decision” and “foolish in the extreme.” He said permanent bans of Twitter accounts should be rare and reserved for accounts that are scams or automated bots.

“I think that was a mistake because it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice,” Musk said. “So I think this may end up being frankly worse than having a single forum where everyone can debate. I guess the answer is that I would reverse the permanent ban.”

Musk has repeatedly criticized Twitter’s content moderation decisions, including the Trump ban, but had mostly avoided saying what he would do about Trump’s account until he was pressed for more details Tuesday by Peter Campbell, a Financial Times automotive correspondent. Twitter banned Trump's account in January 2021 for “incitement of violence” following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Trump has previously said that he had no intention of rejoining Twitter even if his account was reinstated, telling Fox News last month that he would instead focus on his own platform, Truth Social, which has been mired in problems since its launch earlier this year.

“I am not going on Twitter. I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told the network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”

A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment in response to Musk’s remarks.

While Trump was president, his Twitter persona functioned as a mix of policy announcements, often out of the blue; complaints about the media; disparagement of women, minorities and his perceived enemies; and praise for his supporters, replete with exclamation marks, all-caps, and one-word declarations such as “Sad!”

He fired numerous officials on Twitter and his posts, like his speeches at rallies, were a torrent of misinformation.

In announcing Trump's ban, Twitter said Trump tweets amounted to glorification of violence when read in the context of the Capitol riot and plans circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.

Musk’s remarks raise questions about whether those banned besides Trump could also return. The long list of people banned from Twitter includes QAnon loyalists, COVID deniers, neo-Nazis and former reality star Tila Tequila, who was suspended for hate speech.

Other Trump allies kicked off Twitter include Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell, Lin Wood and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was permanently banned in January for repeatedly spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccine safety.

White supremacist David Duke and the often violent Proud Boys organization have been banned, along with far-right trolls like one who goes by the name Baked Alaska, who promoted anti-Semitic tropes and faces charges stemming from his involvement in the Jan. 6 attack.

Conspiracy theorists also have been eliminated. David Icke was kicked off the platform two years ago for spreading misinformation about COVID-19, including claims that Jews and 5G towers were behind the pandemic. Icke is a prominent advocate of the belief that a race of lizard people have taken over the Earth by posing as human leaders.

Alex Jones, the creator of Infowars, was permanently banned in 2018 for abusive behavior. Last year, Jones lost a defamation case filed by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting over Jones’ repeated claims that the shooting was fake.

Twitter, Musk said Tuesday, currently has a strong bias to the left, largely because it is located in San Francisco. This alleged bias prevents it from building trust in the rest of the U.S. and the world, he said: “It’s far too random and I think Twitter needs to be much more even handed.” Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk's comments.

Earlier, Musk said he supported a new European Union law aimed at protecting social media users from harmful content after he met with the bloc's single market chief.

EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he outlined to Musk how the bloc’s online regulations aim to uphold free speech while also making sure whatever is illegal “will be forbidden in the digital space,” which Musk “fully agreed with.”

In a video Breton tweeted late Monday, Musk said the two had a “great discussion"" and that he agrees with the Digital Services Act, which is expected to get final approval later this year. It will make big tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook parent Meta police their platforms more strictly for illegal or harmful content like hate speech and disinformation or face billions in fines.

Capital Bureau | USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Florida’s election-year culture war campaign intensified overnight Tuesday with reports of a leaked draft of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion access.

The ruling, if released as is, would leave states in charge of abortion regulations.

Planned Parenthood of Florida immediately called for protesters to converge on the Florida Supreme Court building in Tallahassee and other courthouses around the state at 5 p.m. Tuesday.

The draft opinion was published by Politico Monday evening, which also reported that most of the justices have voted to overturn the 50-year-old Roe v. Wade decision. In an extraordinary statement hours later, Chief Justice John Roberts verified the authenticity of the draft and announced the court had launched an investigation into the leak.

The court is expected to issue its opinion by the end of June or early July.

Florida lawmakers earlier this year approved a 15-week abortion ban, with strict exceptions for a woman's health or fetal abnormalities, in anticipation of a favorable high court ruling.

“This should be a wakeup call – none of our rights are guaranteed. We have to fight for them and fight to protect them,” said Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, about the draft Politico report that was signed by Justice Samuel Alito.

Abortion and Florida:

'The moment we have been waiting for our entire lives'

The draft if enacted would overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established access to abortion as a constitutional right.

“This is the moment we have been working for our entire lives,” said John Stemberger of the Florida Family Policy Council.

Stemberger and the FFPC was among the groups that backed the 15-week abortion ban (HB 5, signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year.

From USA TODAY:

A poll by Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida found 57% of respondents oppose the new law.

The ban goes into effect July 1, mirrors the Mississippi law at issue in the leaked draft opinion, and abortion rights advocates say they will challenge it.

Paving the way for 'no more legal abortion, period'

Gov. Ron DeSantis encouraged the Legislature to follow Texas and Mississippi in restricting access to abortions.

“We're here today to defend those who can't defend themselves,"" said DeSantis when he signed HB 5 at an evangelical church last month.

“Fifteen weeks is a time where these babies have beating hearts. They can move. They can taste. They can see. They can feel pain. They can suck. And they have brain waves,"" said DeSantis.

Abortion opponents’ efforts to undermine Roe are bolstered by a court system packed with DeSantis and former President Donald Trump appointees.

With the recent announcement that Florida Supreme Court Justice Alan Lawson will retire in August, DeSantis will have selected four of the seven justices.

Meanwhile, three Trump appointees sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.

In an interview after oral arguments, Florida State University law professor Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion law, told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida that the justices went looking for a case to reconsider the Roe decision.

She noted former President Donald Trump “promised to pick, in his words ‘pro-life justices.’”

If Roe is struck down, women’s access to abortion in Florida would not end immediately, said Ziegler, because of the privacy provision in the state constitution that has been used to block abortion restrictions.

But it will end — eventually.

""We have a Republican governor and a Republican legislature and a conservative super-majority on the (state) Supreme Court, so you'd expect sooner or later that Florida would resemble the rest of the South and essentially have no more legal abortion, period.""

Florida officials react: 'nconstitutional, unacceptable, and taking us back to a dark, dark time'

Women advocates view Alito’s draft as an example of government overreach of authority.

Congresswoman Lois Frankel, D-Palm Beach, said it was inappropriate for politicians to decide whether a woman should give birth.

“The decision of whether and when to become a parent should be made by the person who is pregnant, not by their governor or anyone else,” said Frankel, a former Florida House Democratic Leader.

Frankel found it “devastating” Alito not only dismantles Roe’s protections but also criticizes abortion rights as “illegitimate” and not “deeply rooted in history.”

And while U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, up for reelection in November, tweeted a Biblical verse (Jeremiah 1:5), “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,” and denounced Democrats for wanting the “Senate to pass a federal law legalizing the killing of unborn children right up to the day of delivery,” his Democratic challenger, Congresswoman Val Demings, D-Orlando, called the draft “appalling and dangerous.

“We refuse to go back to being treated as second-class citizens whose personal decisions are made by politicians like Marco Rubio, who has fought relentlessly against the right of Florida women to control their own destiny,” said Demings in a statement.

Eskamani plans to use the Alito draft as a rallying cry for the fall campaign.

“We must elect leaders this election cycle who are committed to … defending bodily autonomy and helping those who are most marginalized be able to access abortion,” said Eskamani.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Congressman Charlie Crist, D-St. Petersburg, was quick to remind people he had vetoed an anti-abortion bill when he was governor.

“And I’ll do it again if need be — because I will always stand with women,” tweeted Crist.

Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, also a Democratic candidate for governor, said the draft is the latest attack against women by right wing radicals.

“Overturning our freedom over our bodies is unconstitutional, unacceptable, and taking us back to a dark, dark time,” said Fried, adding, “if they can control our bodies, what do we have left?”

And state Sen. Anette Taddeo, D-Miami, also a gubernatorial candidate, issued a statement saying she was terrified for her teenage daughter’s generation.

“Regression like this is commonplace in fascist countries but has no place in a free society,” said Taddeo. “Make no mistake about it, the brunt of this ruling will be felt by women who cannot afford to cross state lines, the majority of them Black and Brown, to states that allow access to this medical care.”

Abortion opponents call on DeSantis to go further

Florida Voice for the Unborn waded into the debate Tuesday morning with a news release to call on DeSantis to amend this month's special session on property insurance to include legislation to prohibit nearly all Florida abortions.

Andrew Shirvell, the groups executive director, said now is the time for DeSantis to act and outlaw abortion with a narrow exception to protect the mother's life.

""How DeSantis responds at this historic moment in time will forever cement his legacy,"" said Shirvell.

https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/putins-ruthless-special-forces-wiped-29721849,"Putin's ruthless Special Forces wiped out on battlefield, leaked documents reveal","Vladimir Putin's elite special forces have been all but wiped out on the battlefield in Ukraine, leaked documents reveal.

The Russian President's Spetsnaz forces have allegedly been left ""extremely depleted"", suffering a 90 to 95 per cent casualty rate.

Multiple units only narrowly avoided being completely annihilated in the opening weeks of the invasion, it is claimed.

The ruthless troops - which usually carry out clandestine operations - are said to have suffered ""significant losses"" after being brought in to prop up infantry soldiers, with Putin planning to take Kyiv in days.

It comes after the chief suspect behind 'the Pentagon leaks' has been revealed to be a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman.

Investigators believe that guardsman Jack Teixeira, who specialises in intelligence, led an online gaming chat group named 'Thug Shaker Central' where the documents were posted.

FBI agents swarmed Teixeira’s Massachusetts home and heavily armed tactical agents took a man wearing a T-shirt and shorts into custody.

US officials say it could take up to a decade to replenish the Spetsnaz squad, which sees new personnel undertake four years of training.

The Pentagon documents, consisting of 100 pages and dated late last year, suggest Moscow commanders impulsively sent in their best assets almost immediately.

The leaked documents claim the 346th Spetsnaz unit ""lost nearly the entire brigade with only 125 personnel active out of 900 deployed"".

Before-and-after satellite images show a base in southern Russia used by the 22nd Separate Spetsnaz Brigade are said to back up the claims.

Snaps from November 2021 shows the HQ full of tactical vehicles but a picture from a year later shows a substantial lack.

The 25th Spetsnaz Regiment is alleged to have not come back from Ukraine at all.

The supposed losses are also said to have prevented the Kremlin from undertaking clandestine ops in Ukraine.

Three of the special force's top fighters were killed in the Mariupol in March last year.

Captain Konstantin Druzhkov, 33, Islam Abduragimov, 19 and Shamil Aselderov were reportedly taken out by the Azov regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine.

Major Dmitry Toptun was then reportedly killed when his armoured vehicle is said to have been hit by an anti-tank missile while fighting in Izyum, near Kharkiv.

And paratrooper commander Major Alexey Osokin is another top commander killed in battle - with 17 in all said to have been KIA during the invasion.

Russian military expert Rob Lee told the Washington Post the depletion of troops and artillery effectively botched the entire war for Moscow.

The papers also allegedly detail a plot by Kremlin officials to sabotage Putin, hinging on him being incapacitated while undergoing chemo.

Moscow has denied the claims.

In the aftermath of the leak, the Pentagon has ""begun to limit who across the government receives its highly classified daily intelligence briefs,"" reports CNN.",Q2
https://www.infowars.com/posts/astronomers-detect-weird-radio-frequency-radiation-burst-from-galaxy-far-away/,Astronomers Detect ‘Weird’ Radio Frequency Radiation Burst From Galaxy Far Away,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are very short bursts of radiation (only about a millisecond in duration) that flare brightly at radio frequencies.

The majority of them come from distant galaxies, while our Milky Way has only one, and they’re extraordinarily bright, releasing as much energy in a moment as 500 million Suns.

Just the second-ever example of a very active, repeated Fast Radio Burst with a confined source of weaker but persistent radio emission between bursts has been discovered by astronomers, revealing its “weird” nature, according to new research published in the journal Nature.

The discovery raises new questions regarding the nature of these enigmatic pulses of energy, as well as their utility as research tools into the nature of intergalactic space. The pulse, initially spotted in 2019, was studied using the National Science Foundation’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and other telescopes, according to the research.

The pulse, designated as FRB 20190520B, was discovered by China’s FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope).On May 20, 2019, the burst reached Earth, and data from that telescope was discovered in November of that year. Unlike many other FRBs, 20190520B reportedly releases frequent, repetitive bursts of radio waves, according to follow-up observations.

The object’s location was established by measurements with the VLA in 2020, which allowed visible-light studies with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii to demonstrate that it is in the outskirts of a dwarf galaxy roughly 3 billion light-years from Earth. Between bursts, the object produces weaker radio waves, according to the VLA data.

According to Casey Law, an astronomer with Caltech who was part of the research team, these features suggest that it looks similar to the very first confirmed observation of a persistently active FRB.

“These characteristics make this one look a lot like the very first FRB whose position was determined — also by the VLA — back in 2016,” Law said, per the Science Daily report. “Now we have two like this, and that brings up some important questions.”

According to the scientist, that discovery was significant since it provided the first information on an FRB’s environment and distance. However, the 2016 object, known as FRB 121102, was distinguished from all other known FRBs by its combination of repetitive bursts and continuous radio emission between bursts, which came from a compact location.

The distinctions between FRB 20190520B and FRB 121102, as well as all the others, support the hypothesis that there are two types of FRBs, the researchers said. The astronomers speculate that FRBs could be produced by two separate mechanisms or by objects that function differently at different stages of their existence. The superdense neutron stars left over after a big star explodes as a supernova, or neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic fields, known as magnetars, are reportedly the most likely producers of FRBs.

According to the Science Daily, the efficacy of FRBs as tools for examining the material between them and Earth is cast into doubt by one feature of FRB 20190520B.

Astronomers frequently study the effects of intervening material on radio waves radiated by faraway objects in order to understand more about that flimsy material. When radio waves flow across space containing free electrons, one such effect happens. Higher-frequency waves travel faster than lower-frequency waves in this scenario. This effect, known as dispersion, can be studied to determine the density of electrons in the space between the object and Earth, or to offer a rough estimate of the distance to the object if the electron density is known or assumed. The effect is often used to calculate pulsar distances.

The galaxy where FRB 20190520B occurs is estimated to be roughly 3 billion light-years away from Earth, according to an independent assessment based on the Doppler shift of the galaxy’s light induced by the expansion of the Universe.

The burst’s signal, on the other hand, has a level of dispersion that would normally indicate a distance of 8 to 9.5 billion light-years.

FRB 20190520B may be a “newborn,” still surrounded by dense material blasted by the supernova explosion that left behind the neutron star, according to the astronomers. The dispersion of the burst signals would similarly decrease as that substance degrades. According to them, the recurring bursts may be a feature of younger FRBs and fade with age in this scenario.

One of the most interesting features of the FRBs is that the majority of these outbursts have only been observed once: they appear out of nowhere, explode once, and then vanish. As a result, they’re nearly impossible to forecast, as well as trace and examine.

The FRB that was identified in the Milky Way reportedly came from a magnetar, a type of dead star, implying that magnetar eruptions are responsible for at least some FRBs.

https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/03/us/midterms-primary-elections,David McCormick concedes to Dr. Oz in the G.O.P. primary for Senate in Pennsylvania.,"DALLAS — When Beto O’Rourke interrupted a news conference in Uvalde to criticize Gov. Greg Abbott, Jason Smith bristled.

Mr. Smith, a Fort Worth lawyer and Democrat, worried that Mr. O’Rourke’s approach was too confrontational in that moment, a day after an 18-year-old gunman stormed into Robb Elementary School. But in the days that followed, as details emerged that the police waited in a school hallway for more than an hour as children called 911 for help and Mr. Abbott acknowledged being “misled” about the response to the massacre, Mr. Smith changed his mind.

“I was really glad he did it,” he said of Mr. O’Rourke.

Mr. O’Rourke, 49, clearly took a political gamble when he disrupted the governor in an emotional outburst that Republicans and some Democrats believed crossed a line in the aftermath of a mass shooting that left 19 students and two teachers dead. He was speaking not only as an outraged parent and Texan, but also as Mr. Abbott’s Democratic opponent in the race for governor.

But interviews with Democratic lawmakers, strategists and voters in recent days showed that his return to speaking out about gun control and gun violence has helped him make a powerful connection with many over the tragedy in Uvalde, bringing a new energy to his long-shot campaign to unseat Mr. Abbott and a new urgency to efforts to overhaul the state’s lax gun laws.

The very issue that had haunted his campaign for governor for months — his remarks during his 2020 presidential campaign calling for more aggressive gun restrictions — has suddenly helped revive it. Those past comments — “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” he said on a debate stage in 2019 — had seemed politically foolish as he campaigned in gun-friendly Texas, and he had sought to moderate them. Now, to many Texans saddened and angered by a deadly attack on schoolchildren by a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle, Mr. O’Rourke’s stance on guns has taken on a fresh resonance.

“They say that cost him the election,” said Mary Taylor, 66, a retired human resources manager and former substitute teacher who attended a town hall event on guns that Mr. O’Rourke held in Dallas on Wednesday. “But he had the right idea last time, and now he has more people that are getting on the bandwagon.”

In an address at the White House on Thursday, President Biden called on Congress to pass gun control measures. Many were similar to the ones Mr. O’Rourke has been pressing for in Texas — including stronger background checks, a ban on assault weapons and laws to require gun owners to keep their firearms safely stored and allow authorities to take guns away from people who may hurt themselves or others.

For some Democratic state leaders, the massacre and Mr. Abbott’s response compounded their frustration with the governor after his hard-right push on abortion and his rhetoric against immigrants, as well as his handling of the state’s troubled electric grid. Mr. O’Rourke has embodied that breaking point.

“He is frustrated just like me, just like everyone else,” said State Senator Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat who represents Uvalde and who made his own interruption at another Abbott news conference, urging the governor to call for a special session of the Texas Legislature to pass gun-control legislation.

Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign for governor is an uphill battle that some say remains all but impossible in Texas, where Republicans have a solid grip on state power.

No Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas since November 1994 and no Democrat has occupied the governor’s mansion since January 1995, the last day of Gov. Ann W. Richards’s tenure. Despite years of Democratic promises of a blue wave, Texas keeps passing and enforcing some of the most conservative policies in the country. Democratic organizers continue to grapple with low voter turnout as Republicans have made gains in South Texas border cities. And in the governor’s race, Mr. Abbott has a significant financial advantage — he had nearly $50 million in cash on hand compared to Mr. O’Rourke’s roughly $6.8 million as of Feb. 19, according to the latest Texas Ethics Commission filings.

“Their prospects are bleak,” said Cal Jillson, a political analyst and professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “In a good year, they can win some down-ballot offices and even some Texas state legislative seats, but they have not been able to break through statewide, and 2022 is not shaping up to be a good year.”

For the longtime Democratic strategists and activists who have been working to turn the state blue, recent electoral contests have left them at once optimistic and worried. Mr. O’Rourke’s Senate bid in 2018 re-energized the party and helped sway down-ballot races in favor of Democrats as he came within three percentage points of unseating Senator Ted Cruz.

But Texas Republicans were aided by higher turnout in smaller counties in the 2020 election, and those largely rural areas have been shifting even more to the right. In a Republican primary runoff for attorney general two weeks ago, Ken Paxton, the Trump-backed incumbent, trounced George P. Bush, the state’s land commissioner and the last member of the Bush family still in public office.

Mr. O’Rourke, the former El Paso congressman, has cast the race between himself and Mr. Abbott as a choice between old leadership beholden to the gun lobby and his vision for a state where “weapons of war” are removed from civilian life. At the Dallas forum on Wednesday, he said he had rushed the stage to confront the governor in Uvalde because he wished someone had done the same after a mass shooting at a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso in 2019.

“I am more worried that one of those AR-15s is going to be used against my kid or your kid,” he told reporters after the Dallas forum. “The problem we have is that people are more worried about the politics or polling than doing the right thing.”

But Luke Macias, a Republican political consultant who has worked with some of the state’s most conservative lawmakers, said Mr. O’Rourke seems to be returning to the stances that he took as a presidential candidate, ones that damaged his credibility with independent Texas voters.

“Once you lose their trust, it is hard to gain them back,” Mr. Macias said.

Still, Democrats and some independents said they hoped this was the moment that would transcend politics. For many, the emotions from the attack are still raw as funerals have begun in Uvalde, and the trauma has made it difficult for many to even discuss its political ramifications. In conversations, the voices of Democratic leaders and voters often cracked with emotion, and some of them shed tears.

Mr. Smith, the Fort Worth lawyer, spoke as he picked up his 12-year-old twins and 8-year-old son on the last day of school. His children had not been able to bring their backpacks on the last day before the summer break because officials had been concerned someone would bring a gun.

“I think people are really heartbroken about what has happened,” Mr. Smith said. “I don’t think this is just another news story. Parents are scared.”

Since 2017 alone, Texas has been the site of five mass shootings that have taken the lives of 87 victims, including attacks at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs in 2017 and Santa Fe High School southeast of Houston in 2018. Yet even as the governor has held town halls and at times has expressed an openness to tightening gun laws, Texas continues to have some of the least restrictive rules in the country. In 2021, Mr. Abbott signed a law allowing anyone over 21 to carry a handgun without a permit or training.

After the killings in Uvalde, he and other Republican leaders in Texas have focused on the need to increase school security and access to mental health care, though the Uvalde gunman had no known history of mental issues. On Wednesday, Mr. Abbott tweeted a letter to state leaders calling for a special committee to address mass violence in schools. Among the list of topics was “firearm safety.”

Mark Miner, a spokesman for Mr. Abbott’s campaign, said the governor was focused on the response to the tragedy and was declining to speak on political issues at this time.

At Mr. O’Rourke’s town hall in Dallas, where supporters welcomed him with cheers and a standing ovation, he held firm on his support for stronger gun control measures yet also pledged to work with Republicans. He challenged his supporters to knock on doors and have uncomfortable conversations with voters on gun measures in the hopes of finding common ground.

Mr. O’Rourke described how he had promised the mother of Alithia Ramirez, a 10-year-old girl who was killed at Robb Elementary, that he would work to prevent another mother from going through the same trauma. Yet even in Alithia’s own home, the divide was evident: One of her relatives told Mr. O’Rourke that he did not want to give up his AR-15 because he hoped to serve in the military.

“If you are going to trust me to give my life for this country, you should trust me to own an AR-15,” Mr. O’Rourke said the young man told him. But, Mr. O’Rourke added, “there was more that we agreed upon than we disagreed on.”",Q2

Following a number of social posts between the couple, a lot of people like to joke about the engaged pair exchanging blood and morphing souls . It makes for the perfect time for MGK to go undercover and see how people really think about him.

With the help of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Machine Gun Kelly transformed into a brown-haired, glasses and suit-wearing alter ego, who took to the streets of Hollywood to ask random people what they think of him to his face. Here’s one unfiltered opinion MGK heard while standing beside a Hollywood and Highland pedestrian:

I like his music. I find the whole blood-drinking thing a bit unusual. … I'd say [to MGK] congratulations on the wedding. Please don't sacrifice a goat at it.

Little did she know she was speaking to the man himself! When Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly got engaged in January, the Transformers actress ended her sweet social media post by saying “then we drank each other’s blood” which I’d like to think was some sort of poetic metaphor. But maybe she meant it literally like many people took it? Who knows. Anyway, here’s another reaction during MGK’s undercover mission:

Um… not a huge fan. Yeah, I think his new direction is a little forced.

Yikes! Thankfully the pop punk star took the criticism like a champ. He also asked another pedestrian if he looked like Ellen DeGeneres. She said no, but then he brought out a printed side by side of the pair. You could tell he was having a blast making fun of himself, referring to the images of him and Ellen as a “couple of beautiful ladies”. Check out the Jimmy Kimmel “Gundercover” video for yourself:

A couple weeks ago, Machine Gun Kelly released his seventh album Mainstream Sellout, which has the artist continuing to lean into the pop punk revival . The album features collaborations with Willow Smith, Avril Lavigne, Bring Me The Horizon and Lil Wayne among others. Since the artist previously was known for a more hip hop sound, not everyone has jumped aboard his new sound.

MGK’s undercover moment also had some sweet moments, too. He met a fan who clocked him even in his disguise before he shared that he did a big jump during one of his shows before signing a copy of his album. Another funny moment involved the artist revealing himself to a pedestrian after interviewing them, who was totally pleasantly surprised to see it was him. As MGK said at the end of the late night segment:

Came out here expecting a lot of hate, but [there’s] a lot of love. So, fuck you Internet.

Along with the latest album, MGK is planning his wedding with Megan Fox, which he shared he has an “artistic vision” for . The Hollywood couple reportedly are looking to have an “extravagant, dark wedding” that will not be traditional. All that in between the couple each expected to be part of a number of upcoming movies .",Q2
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/delaware-bar-recommends-dgcl-amendments-7732428/,"Delaware bar recommends DGCL amendments, including officer exculpation charter provisions","The Council of the Corporation Law Section of the Delaware State Bar Association has provided recommendations to the Delaware General Assembly for a number of changes to the Delaware General Corporation Law, some of them significant, such as an amendment authorizing charter provisions that would eliminate the personal liability of specified officers for breaches of the duty of care—basically, an extension of DGCL Section 102(b)(7). Typically, the Delaware legislature follows the Council’s recommendations. If adopted and signed into law, the amendments would become effective on August 1, 2022, and generally would apply to actions taken on or after August 1. Several of the recommended changes are discussed below.

Officer exculpation. As you probably remember, DGCL Section 102(b)(7) permits companies to include a provision in their charters limiting or eliminating the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty, excluding the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, transactions in which the director derived an improper personal benefit, and unlawful dividends, stock purchases or redemptions. In effect, the provision primarily provides protection for directors for breaches of the duty of care. Probably the most significant change proposed by the Council for 2022 is the extension of this exculpatory provision to include certain corporate officers. The term “officers” under the proposed amendment refers to persons who, at the time of the act or omission as to which liability is asserted, are deemed to have consented to service of process under DGCL Section 3114(b) (including residents of Delaware), meaning (1) the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, controller, treasurer or chief accounting officer of the corporation; (2) a person identified in the company’s public filings with the SEC as one of the most highly compensated executive officers; or (3) a person who has, by written agreement with the corporation, consented to be identified as an officer for purposes of Section 3114(b).

The exculpatory provision for officers would have the same exclusions as the provision for directors with one significant addition: exculpation would not be permitted for any action by or in the right of the corporation, i.e., derivative claims. Accordingly, the proposed amendments would afford protection for claims for breach of the duty of care brought directly against officers by stockholders, but claims in which officers are alleged to have breached the duty of care could still be made by the board in the name of the corporation and by stockholders on a derivative basis. Why is this change being proposed? According to a memo from the Delaware firm, Richards, Layton & Finger, the amendments were proposed largely “in response to the perverse outcome in which claims for breach of the duty of disclosure against directors were being dismissed, while the same claims against the officers were allowed to proceed.” RLF observes that “the amendments recognize the basic structure of the Delaware corporation—that directors are principally responsible for oversight of the corporation and the long-term best interests of stockholders, while officers are responsible for management of the corporation’s day-to-day affairs. Given that basic design, directors must have the ability to rely on officers—and should have the opportunity to pursue claims for breach of the duty of care against officers who fall short of their obligations.” With regard to derivative litigation, because stockholders must first make a demand on the board (unless futile), the board “will in most cases retain the ability to determine whether to pursue claims for breach of the duty of care against officers.” If the proposed amendment becomes law, companies will be able to take advantage of the new provision only if they amend their charters to include the new language.

Authorization of stock and options. Proposed amendments to DGCL Sections 152, 153 and 157 would change the way stock and options and rights to acquire stock may be authorized. Specifically, the proposed amendments would allow the board or an authorized board committee to delegate to another person or body its authority to issue stock, rights or options, at the times and for the consideration as the person or body may determine, in a resolution that fixes the following: (i) the maximum number of shares of stock, rights or options (including the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of the rights or options), that the person or body may issue or sell, (ii) a time period during which the issuances and exercises may occur, and (iii) the minimum amount of consideration for which the shares, rights or options may be issued (including a minimum amount of consideration for the shares issuable on exercise of the rights or options). The resolution cannot permit the person or body to issue stock, rights or options to the person or body. Any provision in a resolution may be made dependent on facts ascertainable outside the resolution, such as the occurrence of an event, but in that case, the terms contemplated by (i),(ii) and (iii) may not be made dependent on a determination or action by such person or body.

Virtual meeting issues. Section 219 of the DGCL requires companies to make available, for ten days prior to a stockholders’ meeting and at the time and place of the meeting, a list of stockholders entitled to vote, including, in the case of a virtual meeting, on a reasonably accessible electronic network. But do stockholders really need to look at the list during the meeting? This Section is proposed to be amended to require availability of the list ten days ending on the day before the meeting date either at the company’s principal place of business or on an electronic network. The list would no longer be required to be available at the place of the meeting.

The Council is also recommending that Section 222 be amended to address notices of adjournment of virtual meetings, including adjournments taken to address a technical failure to convene or continue a meeting using remote communication. Under the proposal, unless the bylaws provide otherwise, if the meeting is adjourned, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, of the adjourned meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, are (i) announced at the meeting (ii) displayed, during the time scheduled for the meeting, on the same electronic network used to enable stockholders and proxy holders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication or (iii) as set forth in the notice of meeting. The proposed amendment seems to contemplate that, if a technical failure might prevent or crash a virtual meeting, companies may want to include adjournment information in the original meeting notice or, in the event of a crash, on the meeting site.

The Council is also recommending amendments related to conversions of entities to Delaware corporations and conversions of Delaware corporations to other entities, domestication of non-U.S. entities to Delaware corporations, appraisal rights (including demands for appraisal by beneficial owners), stockholder consents, dissolutions, signing of instruments, principal place of business address in the annual franchise tax report and status as large corporate filers.

https://radio.wpsu.org/2022-06-01/a-rare-visit-by-pakistanis-to-israel-has-caused-furor-in-islamabad,A rare visit by Pakistanis to Israel has caused furor in Islamabad,"Updated June 2, 2022 at 10:13 AM ET

JERUSALEM — ""THIS PASSPORT IS VALID FOR ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD EXCEPT ISRAEL,"" reads the phrase on every Pakistani passport.

But there was Fishel BenKhald, one of Pakistan's few Jews, gripping that passport in front of the Western Wall, the revered Jewish prayer site in Jerusalem —

""the land where my heart and my soul is connected to,"" he says.

He arrived in Israel in early May with a rare visit of 15 mostly Pakistani Americans, who traveled on their U.S. passports but who hold close ties in their home country. The trip was organized by an American Muslim women's activist group, and sponsored by an Israeli organization seeking to expand Israel's ties with Muslim-majority countries.

/ Daniel Estrin / Daniel Estrin Pakistan indicates its passport cannot be used for entry into Israel.

The trip drew little attention from Israelis and Palestinians, but it stirred fury in Pakistan, where opposition politicians including ousted ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan saw it as a secretive opening gambit to end their country's official boycott of Israel. Pakistanis were especially angered that a talk show host from state-run television, whom Khan's supporters claimed is close to Pakistan's military, was on the trip. He was subsequently fired.

""The good news,"" Ahmed Quraishi, the TV journalist, says about the Israel trip and subsequent controversy, is ""we today have the first, robust and rich nationwide debate in Pakistan on establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. This is huge.""

Pakistan's senate on Monday passed a resolution confirming its stance against Israel. A senator called for a ban on the organization that spearheaded the trip, the American Muslim and Multifaith Women's Empowerment Council. Some in Pakistan called to strip the expats who traveled to Israel of their Pakistani citizenship.

""This is the price Muslim American Pakistani women have to pay for peace building,"" the group's co-founder, Anila Ali, told NPR.

The anger in Pakistan surged after Israeli President Isaac Herzog spoke publicly about his private meeting with the Pakistani and Pakistani American delegation at his residence in Jerusalem in early May.

""I must say, this was an amazing experience, because we haven't had a group of Pakistani leaders in Israel ever, on such scope,"" Herzog said about the civil society activists before an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""That all stemmed from the Abraham Accords.""

Why Pakistan boycotts Israel

Pakistan officially refuses to forge diplomatic ties with Israel until Palestinians get an independent state. That's long been the case for many Muslim-majority countries. But in 2020, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain established relations with Israel and signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords. Morocco and Sudan have since joined in, and there has been constant speculation among Pakistanis about whether their country might follow suit.

Pakistan and Israel have long held quiet dialogues on military and security matters — both are nuclear powers — and their respective foreign ministers met publicly in 2005.

""I cannot tell you that Pakistan ... is the next state to join the Abraham Accords and that it's going to happen tomorrow,"" Israeli Intelligence Minister Elazar Stern told NPR. ""We hope that every moderate Muslim state, country, in the Middle East will join.""

Israel's focus is more on Saudi Arabia than Pakistan

President Biden's anticipated visit to Israel this month has prompted hopes in the country that a new U.S.-brokered normalization deal could be in the works. Israel has set its sights on Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam's top holy sites and a heavyweight in the region.

/ Sharaka / Sharaka A delegation of Pakistani American and Pakistani interfaith activists meets with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in the president's official residence in Jerusalem.

Israeli media report the U.S. is currently mediating talks for what could become a first public Israeli-Saudi agreement over the status of two Red Sea islands where Israeli ships pass.

""The next stage in the Abraham Accords, in normalization, needs to be normalization with Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told Israel Army Radio on Monday. ""It's a long, cautious process from both sides.""

Though Pakistan is often influenced by its ally Saudi Arabia, the odds today appear stacked against normal relations between Israel and Pakistan.

Many Pakistanis incorporate a Palestinian flag in their social media profiles, and protests against Israel flare up in Pakistan whenever there is an Israeli military escalation with Palestinians. As Pakistan lurches from one political crisis to another, one stance that would almost certainly unite most Pakistanis is opposition to relations with Israel.

There is also deep-seated antisemitism in Pakistan. It is fairly normal in political discourse for events to be blamed on Jews or Jewish conspiracies; the former foreign minister made antisemitic comments on CNN last May.

Geopolitically, Pakistan doesn't have the same concerns about Iran — its nuclear program and its support for militant activities in the Middle East — that drove Pakistan's Gulf neighbors toward Israel.

""If Iran is not the main issue for them, what can they gain?"" Eyal Zisser, a Middle East expert at Tel Aviv University, says about Pakistan. ""Why should they risk themselves in terms of, you know, the public opinion there?""

But Sharaka, the Israeli group that sponsored the delegation to Israel, says both current and former Pakistani officials acquiesced to BenKhald's participation in the Israel trip.

""I would be shocked if this will be the last delegation of Pakistanis, or Pakistani Americans, to Israel,"" says Elie Pieprz, Sharaka's director of international affairs.

Fawad Chaudhry, the former information minister under Khan's government, would not confirm Pakistan gave a green light. ""Our policy is absolutely no recognition or engagement with Israel until establishment of state of Palestine,"" said in a text message to NPR.

Is it a trial balloon?

""It's an open secret that [the Pakistani] establishment has very close ties to the Gulf states,"" says Raza Rumi, director of the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College in New York, and the editor of the liberal Pakistani outlet Naya Daur. ""There must be some debate going on, and this visit was just a testing-the-waters-type visit.""

It may seem that a small interfaith group would have little influence on a country's foreign policy. But such trips can serve as a trial balloon.

An interfaith delegation of Sunni and Shiite Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus and Sikhs from Bahrain made an unprecedented visit to Jerusalem in late 2017, three years before Bahrain established diplomatic relations with Israel.

The Pakistani American delegation visited Tel Aviv, toured Israel's Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, and were guided by a Palestinian tour guide at the Al Aqsa Mosque, central in Islam.

""It is such a blessing to be here in Masjid Al Aqsa. The best moment of my life,"" says Pakistani American Rana Seyd, fighting back tears after her visit to the religious site. ""It's very true that on a Pakistani passport I couldn't have traveled. But that is why I prayed here, that may Allah please guide each one of us to be friends.""

BenKhald, who lives in Karachi and runs a Jewish kosher certification business for food manufacturers exporting their products abroad, hopes his country will end its official boycott of Israel to get help with Pakistan's water crisis. Israel is a parched country that transformed itself into a water technology powerhouse.

""We need that, not after 50 years, no, in the next 15 years, we are requiring that,"" he says.

A chance encounter with an official from another country with tense relations

The Pakistani American activist who helped organize the visit is Ali, the California-based co-founder of the American Muslim and Multifaith Women's Empowerment Council.

""Whenever I've spoken to politicians, and behind closed doors, they'll say, 'You know, we don't have a problem with Israel.' They also say, 'We don't have a problem with Jews.' But then, when you're a politician, that's it, you use that rhetoric. You use the rhetoric to divide,"" she says. ""We must, as people say, 'We don't want you to use that.'""

Last month, she stood with the delegation in front of the Western Wall when suddenly a visiting dignitary arrived from another country at odds with Pakistan.

Indian Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar was in Jerusalem to sign a water technology agreement with Israel. The activists lined up in front of him, and Ali, who counts her family among Pakistan's founding leadership when the country separated from India in 1947, asked the Indian minister to deliver a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""We pray that India and Pakistan make peace and we share Allah's resources,"" she said. ""Water is important for Pakistanis and important for the Indians. So let's all pray for that.""

She proposed India and Pakistan embrace each other, like India has embraced Israel.

The response from the Indian minister was a polite smile.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/06/ukrainian-refugees-european-union-eu/,"Millions of Ukrainian refugees will stay in European Union., says European Commission VP","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. In just over a hundred days, close to 7 million Ukrainians have fled across their nation’s borders, with the vast majority finding sanctuary within the European Union. Ukraine counts four E.U. member states as its neighbors, all of whom opened their borders for what was a mass exodus.

In an unprecedented move following the Russian attack, the European Union as a bloc invoked an emergency power not used since it was conceived two decades ago and granted Ukrainians a kind of blanket protection. The “temporary protection directive,” as it’s known, gives those who receive it an extended right to move freely within the European Union, as well as permissions to work and access to health care, education and housing.

It is “a very generous offer, far beyond the classical asylum protections,” Margaritis Schinas, vice president of the European Commission, told me last week during a visit to Washington. “I would say it’s Europe at its best.”

Schinas, whose portfolio includes coordinating the European Union’s continental approach to asylum and migration policy, thinks that many of these refugees may in the long run not return to their homeland. “I anticipate that this offer is so generous that regardless of the evolution of the war, at least 2.5 million to 3 million people will stay,” he said.

That’s a figure multiple times larger than the number of Syrian and Afghan war refugees given asylum by the E.U. in recent years. For Schinas, it’s a positive development. He described many of the Ukrainian refugees as “highly educated and skilled people” who “can immediately incorporate into our systems,” especially when the continent as a whole faces demographic decline and a significant skills gap in certain critical sectors.

Many of the refugees have tapped into networks of the Ukrainian diaspora and found housing and accommodation, while tens of thousands of citizens across the European Union, Britain and the United States, among other countries, have registered to host or sponsor Ukrainian refugees. Ukrainian schoolchildren are able to access their curriculums digitally. And though coronavirus vaccination rates in Ukraine were relatively low, the surplus stock of vaccines in the European Union means there’s plenty to go around.

All of this, Schinas observed, has led to the continent’s traditional opponents to immigration on the far right being relatively muted about this major Ukrainian influx, which, for now, appears to have caused minimal strains in host nations.

But onlookers elsewhere are less impressed. The reception for Ukrainians stands in stark contrast to how Europe on the whole has viewed asylum seekers from other parts of the world. The slow-burning crisis provoked by the war in Syria in 2015 left deep political scars on the continent: E.U. member states clashed over how to shoulder the burden of the influx, while the arrivals of hundreds of thousands of non-White, non-Christian migrants inflamed the nationalist far right across Europe.

Even last year after the fall of the Afghan government in Kabul to Taliban militants, a statement from E.U. interior ministers prioritized thwarting “illegal migration from the region” and “[reinforcing] border management capacity” over protections for the Afghan people, who bore witness to two decades of a failed Western military adventure in their country.

“The Russian-Ukrainian war revealed the ugly face of Europe. It showed their racism against Arab and African immigrants despite all the human rights slogans,” wrote Marwa El-Shinawy in a column for Daily News Egypt, adding that European governments “seem to believe that the protection of refugees is a right for Europeans only and that the rest of the races are not human beings.”

Perhaps one pointed illustration of this can be seen in Poland, whose right-wing nationalist government had fumed over the prospect of resettling a handful of Syrian refugees but has opened its doors for millions of Ukrainians from next door. In 2015, “the refugees were dark-skinned Muslims, and Warsaw slammed its borders shut,” wrote Andreas Kluth, former editor in chief of Handelsblatt Global, a publication based in Germany. “Now they’re fellow Christians and Slavs, and Poland has warmly welcomed more than half of the 6.7 million Ukrainians who’ve fled abroad.”

Schinas is aware of the criticism but rejects accusations of racism. To those who “somehow imply that skin color is a factor in European migration policy, let me be crystal clear,” he said. “It is not.”

The Brussels official argued that the war in Ukraine — on the E.U.’s immediate doorstep — is a unique circumstance that triggered a different legal mechanism than the earlier waves of migrants. “We give protection to people who flee from war,” he said. “This does not translate to an automatic right of admission for everyone who comes to the European Union.”

But Schinas added that the 2015 migration crisis was a “catalyst,” which “galvanized the European Union into some sort of belief that migration was a common issue.” Compared to seven years ago, the bloc has far greater funding and capacity to absorb migrant influxes and monitor borders.

But no matter the consensus around welcoming Ukrainians, the E.U. still lacks political unity for setting a policy on asylum seekers. Schinas thinks one will emerge soon, which will require unanimity among the bloc’s 27 member states.

“It is mind blowing that Europe has the biggest single market in the world, we account for 20 percent of the world’s GDP,” said Schinas, and can pursue major policy goals, including issuing shared debt and instituting the world’s most aggressive climate goals.",Q2

""It was also solved thanks to the men and women of our agency.""

Devonshire was arrested in late March, 2022 after a DNA sample proved to be a match to swabs collected from one of the victims, Kelliann Ripley. Her body was found in late February in a wooded area in the 1100 block of North Tamiami Trail. Days later, on March 10, the body of another woman was found not far away.

""We had some information leading us to believe that he (Devonshire) could be our suspect, so we had surveillance on him while we were trying to work on the back end with respect to the DNA,"" Troche said.

Devonshire had a criminal history in several states, and was convicted of murder in the state of Delaware in 2005. He was hospitalized in mid-May following a medical event, and after his return to the jail, was under hospice care with a ""do not resuscitate"" order.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/17/democrats-response-buffalo/,Opinion | Democrats are crafting a response to Buffalo. What will the right do?,"As sometimes happens in Washington, a terrible event — in this case the mass shooting in Buffalo — has given new life to an old piece of legislation. So Congress is considering anew the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which has bounced around the Hill for a few years. The bill would create a new department for tackling violent extremism. In considering it, Democrats are having an actual, substantive debate about how the federal government should respond to what is clearly a serious and ongoing threat. People of different perspectives are debating and negotiating as they try to find a solution that balances security and civil liberties.

Which raises a question: How will the right respond? It’s unclear where Republicans will ultimately come down on the bill, but if they engage in good faith, it could be valuable. Yet if the right demagogues the issue — treating it as another occasion to warn that jackbooted federal thugs are out to oppress them — the whole debate could turn into yet another crap show.

Advertisement

The debate among Democrats is producing results. Members of the “Squad” of progressive lawmakers — including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Cori Bush (D-Mo.) — are demanding new changes to strengthen civil liberties protections.

Follow Paul Waldman Follow

And they appear to be getting somewhere. We’re told the changes they want are getting into the bill, and that they’re close to supporting it.

The bill would create new offices focused on domestic terrorism within the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. What is “domestic terrorism”? The bill relies on an existing statutory definition of the term: It refers to acts that threaten human life with the intention of intimidating or coercing a civilian population or influencing government policy.

This is not an ideological definition of “domestic terrorism.” It could refer to white-supremacist terrorism or leftist terrorism, so theoretically a future right-wing president could try to apply this to Black Lives Matter or some other group on the left.

Advertisement

Indeed, it was out of concern that the new offices could target communities they represent that Squad members Omar and Bush worked to put the brakes on the bill. They were echoing objections raised to past versions by the American Civil Liberties Union.

But now, Omar and Bush are close to getting House Democratic leaders to build in protections to prevent abuses of this law, whether toward political activity on the left or right.

For instance, drafters are adding language underscoring limits on the power of the new offices to analyze and monitor targets. The language strengthens the requirement that in carrying out their mission, the offices won’t violate the First Amendment, or the right to protest and assemble, or any applicable civil rights and civil liberties regulations and laws.

With new language, Omar and Bush will be prepared to support the bill, sources close to their offices tell us.

In theory, Republicans should be able to support such a compromise. They tend to support aggressive law enforcement. At the same time, you could understand the safeguards secured by the Squad as protecting people Republicans are more sympathetic to.

That’s because at least in the short run, any effort to track and combat domestic terrorism will necessarily focus in part on the right, because that’s where most domestic terrorism comes from. The Anti-Defamation League documented that from 2012 to 2021, domestic extremists killed 443 Americans, 75 percent of whom were killed by right-wing extremists.

The bill does include a provision to create “an interagency task force to analyze and combat White supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of the uniformed services.” But that’s because this is a serious and specific problem; there does not appear to be any organized effort by left-wing extremists to recruit within the military.

Advertisement

So Republicans could see this moment as an opportunity for bipartisanship: Everyone is supposedly against domestic terrorism, and both liberals and conservatives want to prevent the government from trampling civil liberties in fighting it. Right?

Maybe not. Because we’ve already seen a furious right-wing media response to efforts to combat domestic terrorism, including this bill.

For instance, when an earlier version was introduced after the insurrection attempt, Fox News host Tucker Carlson railed that Democrats “are rushing to embrace a new surveillance state” and “using that as a pretext for creating a new secret police force.”

He was making that up: Neither the earlier vision nor the current one creates a “secret police force.”

But this has been the pattern since President Biden took office. After he called on Americans to reject extremism in his inauguration speech, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) screamed that Biden had called conservatives “racists” and “white supremacists.” Republicans such as J.D. Vance regularly refer to those charged with crimes on Jan. 6 as “political prisoners.”

In other words, some on the right prefer to turn any discussion of domestic terrorism into a story of their own victimhood and a reason to oppose any government action.",Q2

More than 130 protestors arrested during street rallies.

Officers claim crowd defied orders and threw broken bottles and stones.

Diplomatic storm for India as nearly 20 countries call in their Indian envoys for explanations.

Indian police shot dead two protesters and arrested more than 130 others during street rallies sparked by a ruling party official's remarks about Prophet Mohammed (PBUH), authorities told AFP Saturday.

Anger has engulfed the Islamic world since last week when a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party made offensive remarks about the Holy Prophet (PBUH) on a TV debate show.

Muslims took to the streets after Friday prayers in huge numbers across India and neighbouring countries to condemn the remarks, with police firing on a crowd in the eastern city of Ranchi.

""Police were forced to open fire to disperse protesters [...] resulting in the death of two,"" a police officer from the eastern city of Ranchi told AFP.

Officers claimed that the crowd had defied their orders not to march from a mosque to a market and thrown broken bottles and stones when police attempted to disperse the rally with a baton charge.

Authorities cut internet connections in the city and imposed a curfew, with local resident Shabnam Ara telling AFP the atmosphere remained tense on Saturday.

""We are praying for peace and harmony,"" she added.

Police in Uttar Pradesh fired tear gas to disperse at least one rally after several demonstrations were staged across the northern state.

Most protests ended peacefully but demonstrators in some cities had ""thrown stones at police and injured at least one officer"", said Avanish Awasthi, a senior government secretary in the state.

""We will take strict action against those indulging in stone pelting and violence,"" Awasthi told reporters.

""Those working behind the scene, instigating violence, will not be spared at all.""

Prashant Kumar, a senior police officer in the state, told AFP that up to ""136 protesting miscreants"" had been arrested from six districts around Uttar Pradesh.

Cities around India saw sizable demonstrations on Friday, with some crowds burning effigies of Nupur Sharma, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokeswoman whose comments set off the furore.

Diplomatic storm

Sharma's remarks have embroiled India in a diplomatic storm, with the governments of nearly 20 countries calling in their Indian envoys for an explanation.



The BJP has gone into damage control, suspending the official from its ranks and issuing a statement in which the party insisted it respected all religions.

Friday saw the biggest street rallies yet in response to the furore, with police estimating more than 100,000 people mobilised across Bangladesh after midday prayers.

Another 5,000 people took to the streets in the Lahore at the call of a religious party, calling on the government to take stronger action against India over the comments.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/04/05/interstate-65-serial-killer-identified-harry-edward-greenwell/9470242002/,"Man known as the 'I-65 killer' has been revealed, bringing closure to decadeslong search","INDIANAPOLIS — For decades, the identity of an elusive figure, dubbed the “Days Inn” and “I-65” killer, evaded police as investigators tried to solve the slayings of three women in Indiana and Kentucky in the late 1980s.

Tuesday, law enforcement officials said they’ve solved the case.

Indiana State Police, with several federal and local agencies, said investigators have determined that Harry Edward Greenwell, who is now deceased, was responsible for the rapes and murders of Vicki Heath, Margaret “Peggy” Gill and Jeanne Gilbert. The women worked as clerks in motels along the I-65 corridor.

Investigators have also linked him through DNA analysis to a sexual assault of a woman in 1990 in Columbus, Indiana.

Greenwell died of cancer in Iowa in 2013 at age 68.

""There are detectives in this very room that have been involved in this in some form or another for literally generations,"" said Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter. ""I hope today might bring a little bit of solace to know that the animal who did this is no longer on this Earth.""

Tuesday's announcement brings an end to the cold cases of the women's assaults and killings. Police noted, however, there's a ""distinct possibility"" Greenwell could be linked to more unsolved cases. Sgt. Glen Fifield of the Indiana State Police said detectives are continuing to investigate whether Greenwell, who was born in Kentucky, is connected to other violent crime in the Midwest.

I-65 KILLER:What we know about his victims

WHO WAS HE? A timeline of Harry Edward Greenwell's criminal history

Gilbert's daughter, Kim Wright, said the families may never know why their relatives suffered the horrific fate, but the revealing of the killer's identity provided some consolation.

""I'd like to believe that whatever each of us defines as justice, or what each of us might define as closure, that we're all now able to share the healing process knowing the long known attacker has now been brought out of the dark, into the light,"" Wright, an attorney, said.

The announcement of the Days Inn killer's identity bookends an investigation that’s spanned more than 30 years. The search for the killer began in 1987 when Heath, 41, was found assaulted and shot to death behind a Super 8 motel in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.

In 1989, two more women fell victim to the killer.

Gill, a 24-year-old overnight auditor at a Days Inn in Merrillville, was sexually assaulted and killed in the early morning hours of March 3.

An eerily similar attack occurred at another Days Inn dozens of miles away on the same night. Gilbert, a part-time auditor for the Remington motel, was assaulted. A motorist saw the 34-year-old's body on the side of the road in White County. Police said both women were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun.

Police said DNA collected at the scene of Heath’s killing linked to Gilbert's death.

DNA also linked the same attacker behind a 1990 sexual assault of a clerk at a Days Inn in Columbus, Indiana. In that case, the clerk got away and was able to vividly describe the attacker, which led to the police sketch of the suspect that circulated widely.

Police on Tuesday said a DNA match to Greenwell was made through a close family member, and returned a 99.99% probability.

Greenwell's criminal history was detailed in a handout given to reporters by police. In 1963, he was sentenced to two years in the reformatory and five years probation for an armed robbery in Kentucky. Two years later, police arrested him on a sodomy charge. Greenwell was paroled in 1969 from the Kentucky State Penitentiary.

His served a prison sentence in Iowa for burglary. Police said he escaped, and was captured, twice. The prison released him in 1983.

Five years later, the investigation into the Days Inn killer began.

Police credited the ""investigative genealogy"" for the major breakthrough in the case. They said major improvements to DNA technology throughout the years aided their ability to utilize the method.

""I just hope that the effort this group has put in will somehow bring long, overdue closure to the family and friends of not just Miss Heath, but all the victims that are represented,"" said David Fegett, deputy chief of operations of the Elizabethtown police department.

Who were the victims of the I-65 killer?

The case of the I-65 killer began with Heath’s horrific murder.

In February 1987, customers at the Super 8 Motel found no one at the front desk. The lobby was torn apart. The prospective patrons called the police to investigate the strange scene.

Police made the grisly discovery near a trash bin at the back of the motel. Heath had been assaulted and shot twice in the head.

The bloody crime rocked the town of Elizabethtown, Kentucky.

Two years later, the killer continued gruesomely familiar attacks on the same night.

Gill, a 24-year-old night auditor at the Days Inn in Merrillville, was attacked and killed in the early hours of March 3, 1989.

Roughly 50 miles south, another Days Inn clerk suffered the same fate.

Gilbert, a part-time auditor at the Days Inn in Remington, was found shot to death on the side of the road by a motorist driving through White County.

Police determined Gill and Gilbert were killed by bullets from the same gun. Both motels had been robbed. In total, the killer swiped $426.

Gilbert was a working mother taking business courses at St. Joseph’s College, an Indianapolis Star article reported. Gill loved to bake, paint and cross stitch. She worked her way up from being a maid at the motel to an auditor position.

Gill’s parents at the time said they don’t speak about revenge – just uncertainty. Her mother called the lack of a suspect at the time a “mixed blessing.”

“In some ways, it’s peace not to have to look at someone. But you read about something else and you wonder ‘was that him, too?’” Anna Gill said at the time.

Decades later, Wright told reporters that she also feels peace. While she and the other families may never be able to answer some questions about their loved one's final moments, she finds peace in Gilbert's memory.

She remembers her mother's last words to her and her brother — specifically how Gilbert said she loved them and would see them ""tomorrow.""

""I didn't see her that tomorrow,"" she said. ""But I see her every day. I see her in me. I see her in my brother. I see her in my family.""",Q2

Israel says troops exchanged fire with Palestinians

Veteran journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, 51, was wearing a press vest that clearly marked her as “Press” while reporting in the city of Jenin, the Qatar-based outlet said.

She was covering the latest arrest operation launched by the Israeli military amid deadly Arab attacks in Israel.

The death of a distinguished reporter who has been covering Palestinian affairs and the Middle East for over two decades at the popular news channel watched by millions in the Arab world seemed likely to add fuel to a surging conflict.

Read in Daily Maverick: The critically endangered species of lesser spotted Real Journalists, by Branko Brkic

In an Al Jazeera video captured in the moments around Abu Akleh’s killing, gunfire can be heard in the first few seconds before a man yells “Shireen! Shireen! Ambulance!”

The camera then moves around the corner to show Abu Akleh slumped face-forward on the ground. Other journalists are seen rushing to take cover.

Another Palestinian journalist at the scene, Ali Samoodi, was also wounded.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas described Abu Akleh’s death as blatant, cold-blooded murder by the Israeli military, which said dozens of Palestinian gunmen had confronted troops who arrested a Hamas militant in Jenin.

A Palestinian medical examiner, however, did not echo the accusation, declining to comment on who might have fired the round, after an autopsy was conducted in the West Bank.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Abbas was making unfounded allegations, before Israel conducted a “thorough investigation.”

Bennett said it appeared likely that Palestinians “firing indiscriminately” were responsible for Abu Akleh’s death. But Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz later was more circumspect.

“Our initial findings from the investigation so far cannot indicate what gunfire was directed at Shireen, and I cannot exclude any option under the operational chaos on the ground,” Gantz told reporters.

The White House strongly condemned the killing and called for an investigation into Abu Akleh’s death. Read full story

On Twitter, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said her death was an affront to media freedom everywhere.

“The Israelis have the wherewithal and the capabilities to conduct a thorough, comprehensive investigation,” Price told a news briefing.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “appalled” by the killing and called on “the relevant authorities to carry out an independent and transparent investigation” to ensure that those responsible are held accountable, deputy U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said in a statement.

CASUALTIES

The journalist Samoodi said Israeli forces “suddenly opened fire” towards Abu Akleh and himself during the Jenin operation. He disputed an Israeli military account that gunmen were nearby when the two were shot.

Since March, Palestinians and members of Israel’s Arab minority have killed 18 people, including three police officers and a security guard, in attacks in Israel and the West Bank that have mostly targeted civilians.

Some of the assailants have come from Jenin. The city has been a main target of Israeli arrest raids in the West Bank that have often sparked clashes and brought the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or armed civilians since the beginning of the year to at least 42.

Read in Daily Maverick: It’s the World Press Survival Day as we know it

The casualties include armed members of militant groups, lone assailants and bystanders.

Visits by Jewish pilgrims over the past weeks to Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem, Islam’s third holiest site and the most sacred place in Judaism, have stoked Palestinian anger.

Treated for his wounds in a hospital in Jenin, Samoodi told reporters: “They (Israeli soldiers) didn’t ask us to leave and they didn’t ask us to stop (filming). They fired at us. One bullet hit me and another hit Shireen. They killed her in cold blood.”

An Israeli military spokesman, briefing foreign journalists and describing Abu Akleh’s death as tragic, said Israeli troops would never deliberately target a non-combatant. He said there had been three direct exchanges of fire with Palestinian gunmen during the raid.

World leaders, human rights defenders and press freedom groups condemned the killing and called for an investigation.

The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, recalled being interviewed by the “well respected” Abu Akleh late last year and called her death “really horrifying.”

In a Reuters video, Abu Akleh’s colleagues were seen standing around her body, which was wrapped in the Palestinian flag with a press jacket on top, as a priest said a prayer.

The U.S. commander of American forces in the Middle East, Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, said his thoughts were with Abu Akleh, her family and her colleagues at Al Jazeera.

“Around the world, reporters such as Shireen demonstrate extraordinary courage every day,” Kurilla said during a trip to the region.

https://www.ipsnews.net/2022/06/open-borders-world/,An Open Borders World,"An Open Borders World

PORTLAND, USA, Jun 9 2022 (IPS) - A world with open borders, as some strongly advocate while others insist on maintaining controlled borders, is an interesting exercise to consider given its potential consequences for nations, the planet’s 8 billion human inhabitants, climate change, and the environment.

Based on international surveys of 152 countries taken several years ago before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 15 percent of the world’s adults said that they would like to migrate permanently to another country if they could. Based on that percentage for adults plus their family members, the estimated number of people who want to migrate in 2022 is likely to be no less than 1.5 billion.

Seven destination countries attract half of those wanting to migrate to another country. The top destination country at 21 percent of those wanting to migrate is the United States. Substantially lower, Canada and Germany are next at 6 percent, followed by France and Australia at 5 percent, the United Kingdom at 4 percent, and Saudi Arabia at 3 percent





The figure of 1.5 billion wanting to migrate is more than 5 times the estimated number of immigrants in the world in 2020, or about 281 million . The figure of potential immigrants is also approximately 500 times the annual flow of immigrants globally.

The two regions with the highest proportions wanting to migrate to another country if they had the chance are sub-Saharan Africa at 33 percent and Latin America and the Caribbean at 27 percent. In addition, in 13 countries at least half of their populations would like to migrate to another country.

The top three countries with the proportion of their adult populations wanting to migrate are Sierra Leone at 71 percent, Liberia at 66 percent, and Haiti at 63 percent. They are followed by Albania at 60 percent, El Salvador at 52 percent, the Democratic Republic of the Congo at 50 percent.

Seven destination countries attract half of those wanting to migrate to another country. The top destination country at 21 percent of those wanting to migrate is the United States. Substantially lower, Canada and Germany are next at 6 percent, followed by France and Australia at 5 percent, the United Kingdom at 4 percent, and Saudi Arabia at 3 percent.

Among those seven destination countries, the numbers wanting to migrate are greater than the current populations of five of them. For example, the number of people wanting to migrate to Canada is 90 million versus its current population of 38 million. Similarly, the number wanting to migrate to Germany is 94 million versus its current population of 84 million. In the remaining two countries, the United States and the United Kingdom, the numbers wanting to migrate are nearly the same size as their current populations (Figure 1).

In addition to its impact on the size of populations, open borders would alter the ethnic, religious, and linguistic composition of populations, leading to increased cultural diversity. Past and present international migration flows have demonstrated alterations in the cultural composition of populations.

In the United States, for example, since 1965 when the Immigration and National Act on country of origin was passed, the proportion Hispanic increased nearly five-fold, from 4 percent to 19 percent in 2020, and the proportion non-Hispanic white declined from 84 percent to 58 percent. Similarly in Germany, the proportion Muslim since 1965 has increased five-fold, from less than 1 percent to 5 percent of the population in 2020.

Various reasons have been offered both in support and in opposition to an open borders world. For example, those opposed believe open borders would increase security threats, damage domestic economies, benefit big business and elites, increase societal costs, encourage brain drain, facilitate illegal trade, reduce labor wages, undermine cultural integrity, and create integration problems (Table 1).

In contrast, those in support believe open borders would provide a basic human right, reduce poverty, increase GDP growth, reduce border control costs, increase the labor supply, provide talented workers, promote travel, reduce time and costs of travel, raise a country’s tax base, promote cultural diversity, and contribute to global interdependence.

Open borders would certainly impact the cultural composition of populations. Even without open borders, the current changes in the cultural composition of populations being brought about by international migration have not only raised public concerns but have also contributed to the growing influence of nativist and far-right political parties.

The nativist parties are typically opposed to immigration, seeing it as a threat to their national cultural integrity. In contrast, those supportive of immigration welcome the arrival of people with differing backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures. They view immigration it as a natural, ongoing human phenomenon that enriches societies.

Open borders would also have consequences on climate change and the environment. Large numbers of people would be migrating to countries with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions per capita. For example, while the world average of tons of CO2 equivalent per person is about 6, the level in the United States is about three times as large at 19.

Similarly, open borders would impact the environment. The migration to the high consumption destination countries would lead to increased biodiversity loss, pollution, and congestion.

An open borders world is not likely to happen any time soon. However, recent large-scale immigration flows, both legal and illegal, are substantially impacting government programs, domestic politics, international relations, and public opinion as well as the size and composition of the populations.

In virtually every region, governments appear to be at a loss on how best to address international migration, especially the waves of illegal migration arriving daily at international borders and the many already residing unlawfully within their countries. International conventions, agreements, and compacts concerning international migration are largely viewed as being outdated, unrealistic, and ineffective in dealing with today’s international migration issues.

The supply of men, women, and children in poor developing countries wanting to migrate greatly exceeds the demand for those migrants in wealthy developed countries by a factor of about five hundred.

The result is the Great Migration Clash, i.e., a worldwide struggle between those who “want out” of their countries and those who want others to “keep out” of their countries.

Given the enormous difference in supply and demand, the Migration Clash is unlikely to be resolved by simply asking destination countries to raise their immigration levels. To resolve the Migration Clash will require considerably improving the social, economic, political, and environmental conditions of the populations in the migrant sending countries.

Achieving those desirable development goals any time soon, however, appears as unlikely as establishing an open borders world. Therefore, countries will continue dealing the best they can with the consequences of controlled borders and the Great Migration Clash.

JACKSON, Miss — A team searching the basement of a Mississippi courthouse for evidence about the lynching of Black teenager Emmett Till has found the unserved warrant charging a white woman in his 1955 kidnapping, and relatives of the victim who initiated the hunt want authorities to finally arrest her nearly 70 years later.

A warrant for the arrest of Carolyn Bryant Donham — identified as ""Mrs. Roy Bryant"" on the document — was discovered last week inside a file folder that had been placed in a box, Leflore County Circuit Clerk Elmus Stockstill told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

Documents are kept inside boxes by decade, he said, but there was nothing else to indicate where the warrant, dated Aug. 29, 1955, might have been.

""They narrowed it down between the '50s and '60s and got lucky,"" said Stockstill, who certified the warrant as genuine.

The search was started by the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation and included two members of Till's family: Cousin Deborah Watts, head of the Foundation; and her daughter, Teri Watts. They want authorities to use the warrant to arrest Donham, who at the time of the slaying was married to one of two white men tried and acquitted just weeks after Till was abducted from a relative's home, killed and dumped into a river.

""Serve it and charge her,"" Teri Watts told the AP in an interview.

Donham set off the case in August 1955 by accusing the 14-year-old Till of making improper advances at a family store in Money, Mississippi. A cousin of Till who was there has said Till whistled at the woman, which flew in the face of Mississippi's racist social codes of the era.

Evidence indicates a woman, possibly Donham, identified Till to the men who later killed him. The arrest warrant against Donham was publicized at the time, but the Leflore County sheriff told reporters he did not want to ""bother"" the woman since she had two young children to care for.

Now in her 80s and most recently living in North Carolina, Donham has not comment publicly on calls for her prosecution. But Teri Watts said the Till family believes the warrant accusing Donham of kidnapping amounts to new evidence.

""This is what the state of Mississippi needs to go ahead,"" she said.

District Attorney Dewayne Richardson, whose office would prosecute a case, declined comment on the warrant but cited a December report about the Till case from the Justice Department, which said no prosecution was possible.

Contacted by the AP on Wednesday, Leflore County Sheriff Ricky Banks said: ""This is the first time I've known about a warrant.""

Banks, who was 7 years old when Till was killed, said ""nothing was said about a warrant"" when a former district attorney investigated the case five or six years ago.

""I will see if I can get a copy of the warrant and get with the DA and get their opinion on it,"" Banks said. If the warrant can still be served, Banks said, he would have to talk to law enforcement officers in the state where Donham resides.

Arrest warrants can ""go stale"" due to the passage of time and changing circumstances, and one from 1955 almost certainly would not pass muster before a court, even if a sheriff agreed to serve it, said Ronald J. Rychlak, a law professor at the University of Mississippi.

But combined with any new evidence, the original arrest warrant ""absolutely"" could be an important stepping stone toward establishing probable cause to initiate a new prosecution, he said.

""If you went in front of a judge you could say, 'Once upon a time a judge determined there was probable cause, and much more information is available today,'"" Rychlak said.

Till, who was from Chicago, was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he entered the store where Donham, then 21, was working on Aug. 24, 1955. A Till relative who was there at the time, Wheeler Parker, told AP that Till whistled at the woman. Donham testified in court that Till also grabbed her and made a lewd comment.

Two nights later, Donham's then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, showed up armed at the rural Leflore County home of Till's great-uncle, Mose Wright, looking for the youth. Till's brutalized body, weighted down by a fan, was pulled from a river days later in another county. His mother's decision to open the casket so mourners in Chicago could see what had happened helped galvanize the building civil rights movement of the time.

Bryant and Milam were acquitted of murder but later admitted the killing in a magazine interview. While both men were named in the same warrant that accused Donham of kidnapping, authorities did not pursue the case following their acquittal.

Wright testified during the murder trial that a person with a voice ""lighter"" than a man's identified Till from inside a pickup truck and the abductors took him away from the family home. Other evidence in FBI files indicates that earlier that same night, Donham told her husband that at least two other Black men were not the right person.

DEL RIO, Texas—Border Patrol agents apprehended 211,972 illegal immigrants along the U.S. southern border in April, according to preliminary Customs and Border Protection (CBP) numbers obtained by The Epoch Times.

The number of apprehensions is markedly higher than any April on record, including during the past 10 years, when apprehensions ranged from a low of 11,000 in 2017 to 99,273 in 2019—until last year when April hit 173,701.

CBP statistics also indicate that more than 58,000 illegal immigrants evaded apprehension in April, with Tucson, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas, being the two busiest sectors for “gotaways.”

The April numbers show a continued increase in illegal crossings for each month this year. In total, Border Patrol has apprehended more than 728,000 illegal aliens along the southern border since January.

Most of those apprehensions have occurred in Texas, which has seen 448,285 Border Patrol arrests since January.

Agents are bracing for an even higher influx as the Biden administration prepares to end Title 42 expulsions on May 23. The Title 42 public health provision has allowed for the quick expulsion of non-essential travelers at U.S. borders to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has warned agents to expect up to 18,000 apprehensions per day in the coming months. Currently, agents are apprehending about 7,000 illegal aliens per day along the southern border.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended his handling of the border in congressional hearings last week. He told the House Judiciary Committee on April 28 that his department “has been executing a comprehensive strategy to secure our borders and rebuild our immigration system.”

​​Mayorkas said his agency has “operational control” of the border, despite reaching record-high numbers of illegal border crossings and releases of illegal immigrants into the United States.

Mayorkas confirmed on May 1 that about 1.4 million illegal border crossers have evaded capture or been released into the United States since Biden took office in 2021.

“It is the objective of the Biden administration to make sure that we have safe, legal, and orderly pathways for individuals to be able to access our legal system,” Mayrokas told Fox News’ Bret Baier when asked if the objective is to sharply reduce illegal immigration.

The highest number of apprehensions recorded in a fiscal year since the formation of the Border Patrol was 1.69 million in fiscal 1986. This year is on track to hit well above that record, with a current 1.2 million apprehensions and five months remaining in 2022.",Q2

Finally! Louisiana becomes the 9th state to ban the sale of cosmetics that have been tested on animals. This is a huge win for rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, rats, and all other animals used for testing.

Source: Lush Cosmetics North America/Youtube

Eight other states, California, Nevada, Illinois, Virginia, Maryland, Maine, Hawaii, and New Jersey, have already banned the sale of these cruel cosmetics. Consumers are increasingly more aware of how cruel animal testing is and how unnecessary the outdated practice is. There is no reason that products like shampoo, aftershave, or makeup need to be tested on animals.

This is a huge win for the state of Louisiana, but we need to continue to make this a law in every other state. Banning animal testing for cosmetics at a federal level would be a huge influencer in states finally working towards an official ban that would save animals.

Animals in laboratories experience horrific suffering and death. On top of that, the animals come from breeding facilities where they often aren’t given proper veterinary care, food, or water and live in terrible and cramped conditions. The passage of this bill will be a huge step forward for non-human animals and society as a whole.

Numerous companies are standing up against animal testing, and recently the USDA decided to eliminate some mammalian testing by 2025. The majority of animal testing is used in medicine and for other human products and treatments. According to PETA, the National Institutes of Health wastes $12 billion annually on animal testing that leads nowhere, these experiments on animals fail 90% of the time! The research used on animals rarely correlates when it is tested on humans, making it a waste of money and unnecessary. Monkeys, mice, rats, and dogs are all used in animal experiments around the nation. It’s time countries ban animal experimentation altogether as it hurts humans as well.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2022/06/08/fact-checking-greg-abbotts-claim-chicago-gun-laws/10002165002/,Fact-check: Does Chicago gun violence disprove tougher gun laws can prevent gun violence?,"Analisa Trofimuk, PolitiFact.com

Greg Abbott: ""We need to realize that people who think that ‘well, maybe if we could just implement tougher gun laws, it’s going to solve it,’ Chicago and LA and New York disprove that thesis.""

PolitiFact's ruling: Mostly False

Here's why: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, after a mass shooting at an elementary school in his state, pointed to Chicago as an example of how ""real gun laws"" fail to protect school children and teachers from shootings.

""I hate to say this, but there are more people who were shot every weekend in Chicago than there are in schools in Texas,"" he said during a nationally televised news conference the day after the shooting.

""We need to realize that people who think that ‘well, maybe if we could just implement tougher gun laws, it’s going to solve it,’ Chicago and LA and New York disprove that thesis. And so, if you’re looking for a real solution, Chicago teaches that what you’re talking about is not a real solution.""

Abbott’s remarks came amid the most recent flurry of demands for tougher gun laws after a gunman at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, killed 19 fourth graders and two teachers on May 24.

Abbott’s remarks also recalls a long-repeated Republican talking point that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the nation. It doesn’t.

PolitiFact has fact-checked multiple claims on this point. In every case, the reporting has shown Chicago and Illinois do not have the strictest laws compared to other states, although they are tougher than in Texas. Federal court decisions have loosened once-tough restriction, and many experts agree additional reform could have a positive impact.

Since it is difficult to parse Abbott’s comparison of all Chicago shootings to shootings in Texas schools — or statewide Texas shooting deaths to various cities — we decided to compare statewide statistics, which in each state he mentioned are influenced most by urban gun violence.

Abbott nor his communications staff returned a request for comment for this fact-check.

'We have a life preservation problem':McConaughey calls for gun reform in White House speech

Chicago’s gun ban struck down

Chicago’s reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. By 2010, it was the only major city left with a blanket handgun ban.

But the ban was struck down in 2010 in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling McDonald v. City of Chicago, which called such outright bans a violation of the Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights. That decision left intact the statewide ban on concealed firearms until two years later when an appeals court declared that unconstitutional as well. Illinois then joined every other state in the nation in allowing licensed citizens to carry concealed firearms.

In 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed that Chicago had the toughest gun laws in the United States and more gun violence than any other city. That was Mostly False.

The fact check said cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco do more to regulate the concealed-carry permitting process, while Illinois simply processes applications through the Illinois State Police.

Illinois gets an A- from gun control advocacy group

Despite the 2010 and 2012 court rulings, Illinois still has tougher gun restrictions than Texas.

According to Giffords Law Center, an organization which advocates for gun control, Illinois requires universal background checks, gun owner licensing, lost and stolen firearm reporting, waiting periods and has minimum age laws, open carry reporting, community violence intervention funding, risk protection orders and domestic violence gun laws.

Texas has none of those. The state does however, have child access prevention laws, which Illinois also has.

Gifford’s gave Illinois an A- ranking on its 2021 Annual Gun Law Scorecard — meaning the state has strong laws to reduce the risk of gun-related crimes. Giffords said that while some changes were made in 2020, Illinois as a whole can take measures to improve gun control.

Those improvements include: Prohibiting the sale of large-capacity magazines and enacting a gun accountability law. The gun control group also suggested Illinois could ban the manufacturing and selling of ""ghost guns,"" firearms that law enforcement can’t track because they lack serial numbers — an issue Illinois has since addressed in state law enacted this year.

Giffords gave Texas an F rating for weak gun laws, along with Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The only neighboring state with a better grade is New Mexico with a C.

At the same time, Illinois and Texas are roughly the same when it comes to gun deaths per capita, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2020, Illinois reported 14.1 gun-related deaths per 100,000, compared to Texas’ 14.2 rate, according to the latest available CDC data.

Experts interviewed by the BGA suggest Abbott’s comparison to gun laws in Texas and Chicago are inherently misleading because gun laws in nearby states — such as Indiana and Wisconsin — more resemble those in Texas where less stringent gun laws allow easier access.

""Many factors determine the rates of homicide and violent crime from city to city,"" said Daniel Webster, a co-director of Johns Hopkins’ Center for Gun Violence Solutions. ""You assess the impact of policies by examining changes in homicides and violent crime after gun laws are enacted and contrast that with changes in places that didn’t adopt the policies.""

A 2017 Gun Trace Report released by the Chicago Police Department shows the majority of illegal guns came to Chicago from Indiana and outside of Chicago’s city limits.

""The majority of illegally used or possessed firearms recovered in Chicago are traced back to states with less regulation over firearms, such as Indiana and Mississippi,"" the report said. ""More than two of every five traceable crime guns recovered in Chicago originate with their first point of sale at an Illinois dealer.""

The remaining 60% of firearms come from out of state, with Indiana as the primary source for one out of every five crime guns.

""This pattern also highlights Chicago’s challenge to address illegal guns within the loosely-regulated national gun market,"" the report said.

Abbott’s claim also falls short when it comes to his comparisons to California and New York.

In 2020, both California and the state of New York had lower gun death rates than did Texas. Both California and New York have tougher gun laws than Texas, and both are surrounded by states with tougher gun laws compared to a large portion of the rest of the country.

Gifford’s classifies California as having the strongest gun laws in the nation.

Matthew McConaughey:It’s time to act on gun responsibility

Our ruling

Abbott said Chicago, New York City and LA are all examples of how tough gun laws do not work.

While Chicago’s gun laws may be more strict than some states, Abbott’s statement ignores how regulations have been weakened after federal court reversals of the city’s once-tougher restrictions. He also ignores how the majority of firearms in Chicago are coming from neighboring states where gun laws more reflect those of his own state, illustrating the impact of the lack of national regulation.

States like New York and California with lower gun death rates are for the most part surrounded by states with tougher gun laws.

We rate this claim Mostly False.

https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/world/2022-05-21-first-of-funerals-for-10-killed-at-buffalo-grocery-held/,First of funerals for 10 killed at Buffalo grocery held,"The first funeral is being held on Friday for one of 10 people killed in a livestreamed shooting by an 18-year-old white man at a supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York.

Friends and family will memorialise Deacon Heyward Patterson, 67, at a private service closed to the media. It will take place at Lincoln Memorial United Methodist Church, less than a mile from the Tops Friendly Markets store where 13 people - 11 of them Black - were shot Saturday by the gunman firing a semi-automatic, assault-style rifle.

Patterson, whom many called Deke or Deacon, was a constant presence at Tops, the lone supermarket in the majority-Black community on the east side of Buffalo, according to Yvonda King, a 55-year-old hair stylist.

A kindly, affable man, Patterson would provide rides to elderly shoppers - ""jitneying"" in the local parlance - with his car.

""I grew up with him all my life. He would give you the shirt off his back,"" King said. ""He was there every day, helping the elderly get around, or anyone who needs to get around as far as jitneying.""

Patterson, the oldest of seven, was born in South Carolina and moved to Buffalo with his family at a young age. He was a husband, a father to three and several grandchildren, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing his wife Tirzah Patterson.

At a Thursday press conference, Tirzah Patterson said she was recently separated from her husband, though they continued to raise their 12-year-old son.

""I need a village to help me raise and be here for my son, because he has no father,"" she said.

Heyward Patterson served as a deacon at State Tabernacle Church of God in Christ nearby the Tops store. He volunteered at the church's soup kitchen, according to the Times.

Services for some of the other victims are set for next week, while others have yet to be arranged.

Last Saturday's rampage, which authorities said the gunman had carefully planned with an eye toward killing as many Black people as he could, has touched a nerve in a country that has grown accustomed to mass shootings.

The suspect, Payton Gendron, briefly appeared in court on Thursday in a case that has spurred a national debate over the intersection of guns, hate and the internet.

Erie County prosecutors have charged Gendron with a single count of first-degree murder in the massacre. He faces life in prison without parole if convicted on the murder charge.

The FBI has said the shooting is under investigation as a hate crime and an act of ""racially motivated violent extremism.""

Depp, the Pirates of the Caribbean star, declared that a US jury gave him his life back when it awarded him a near-total victory in his defamation fight with ex-wife Heard on Wednesday.

Jurors supported Depp’s three claims that Heard had defamed him and awarded him more than $10 million in damages. Heard won one counter-claim that Depp’s lawyer had defamed her. The jury awarded Heard $2 million. The verdicts came with a cost. Over six weeks, the televised trial provided vivid detail about a troubled marriage and evidence that both Depp and Heard admitted was embarrassing.

Still, Depp is expected to be offered new movie roles, now that the US jury has backed him following a years-long legal battle, said Clayton Davis, senior awards editor at Hollywood publication Variety.

“I think Johnny Depp is going to work again. He’s going to get some big project,” Davis said after the verdict, noting Hollywood offers plenty of examples of stars who recovered from very public scandals.

Robert Downey Jr, Mel Gibson, Hugh Grant, Roman Polanski and others found new opportunities after serious allegations of improper behaviour, criminal convictions or missteps. Kevin Spacey has acted in a handful of independent films after being accused in 2018 of sexual misconduct, which he denies. “We have a culture that allows these people to work again,” Davis said.

Johnny Depp's lavish spending habits were put on blast with testimony from his former financial manager during the actor's defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard.

Depp's former financial manager Joel Mandel testified earlier this month that the actor, 58, earned more than $600 million between 1999 and 2016. He claimed the Pirates of the Caribbean star's spending habits were becoming increasingly irresponsible during that time period.

Depp spent his money on mansions, a fleet of luxury cars, traveling only by private plane and blasting his late friend Hunter S. Thompson's ashes from a cannon. He also spent $100,000 per month for an addiction doctor, $10,000 a day for security detail and $300,000 per month for a full-time staff.

Depp's extravagant spending was first revealed in a 2016 countersuit from Mandel and his former business management company, The Management Group after Depp sued them alleging it grossly mismanaged his earnings.

A countersuit followed that claimed Depp's lavish lifestyle that cost more than $2 million a month to maintain caused his recent financial troubles and that the star ignored their repeated warnings.

Johnny Depp, 58, who reportedly earned more than $600 million between 1999 and 2016, spent the money on mansions, a fleet of luxury cars, traveling only by private plane

The company handled Depp's finances during a lucrative time in his career as he launched the blockbuster 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise and other big-budget releases, including 'Alice in Wonderland' and the 2005 film 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.'

Pirates of the Caribbean and its five sequels are estimated to have earned Depp more than $300 million, although he has now been axed from the movies, with a female-led reboot planned.

The lawsuit said Depp paid more than $75 million to buy and maintain 14 homes, including a French chateau and a chain of islands in the Bahamas.

Depp also spent heavily to buy a 150-foot yacht, fly on private jets and cultivate collections of fine art and Hollywood memorabilia requiring 12 storage facilities, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit against Mandel was settled in 2016, but Depp's spending was once again in the spotlight when Mandel took the stand earlier this month in the Depp vs. Heard defamation trial, testifying that Depp had become increasingly irresponsible over the 17 years he worked with him, during which he estimated the actor had earned $600million.

He said spending levels became 'very large' around 2010 when Depp shot 'The Rum Diary' where he met Heard. Mandel testified that Depp consumed more alcohol and drugs at the time and discussion of finances became rare.

Mandel's deposition was shown to jurors as part of Depp's lawsuit against Heard.

Depp alleges Heard defamed him when describing herself as a victim of domestic violence in a 2018 op-ed piece which he claims led to tarnishing his career and loss of potential earnings. Heard filed a $100 million countersuit alleging Depp physically assaulted her during their marriage, often while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Jurors were tasked with deliberating whether either actor was defamed and deserves millions of dollars in damages.

$100,000 per month for an addiction doctor, $10,000 per day for security detail and $300,000 per month for a full-time staff

Mandel testified that Depp sent $100,000 to Dr. David Kipper every month. Depp hired the doctor in 2014 to help treat his addiction issues after Depp became dependent on opioid medication following a leg injury, he said. Depp and Heard were also each assigned a nurse.

Mandel testified that Depp sent $10,000 to Jerry Judge, Depp's former security manager, every day. Judge was in charge of employing a security team to guard Depp at all times.

Depp also spent $300,000 per month for a full-time staff, many of whom worked at his portfolio of luxury properties.

An $18 million luxury yacht

Depp previously named the yacht Vajoliroja - a pun on the Jolly Roger pirate flag when said aloud - after his ex-partner Vanessa Paradis and their children Lily-Rose and Jack

JK Rowling reportedly bought the yacht off him in 2016 for $18 million

Depp previously named the yacht Vajoliroja - a pun on the Jolly Roger pirate flag when said aloud - after his ex-partner Vanessa Paradis and their children Lily-Rose and Jack.

The actor spent £5million renovating the yacht in 2008, giving it a distinctly bohemian feel with plenty of wood and luscious fabric throughout its plush art deco interior, as well as a subtle pirate theme.

JK Rowling reportedly bought the yacht off him in 2016.

She was wooed by the lavish yet charming 156ft liner after holidaying onboard with her family. The author - who has faced her own trial by social media after being attacked by woke mobs over her views on trans people - threw her support behind Depp after initial allegations against him emerged.

She released a statement backing him after calls were made for him to be fired from the Fantastic Beasts movie series, based on Rowling's Harry Potter book series.

But studio bosses eventually gave in to fan pressure, and booted Depp from the franchise.

During Amber Heard's trial, the actress made dramatic claims about furious fights she'd endured with Depp aboard his jet.

Thousands spent on wine each month

Depp (pictured here at Times Square Virgin Megastore, NYC, in 1998), reportedly spent $30,000 a month on wine that was 'flown in from all over the world for personal consumption'

Depp reportedly spent $30,000 a month on wine that was 'flown in from all over the world for personal consumption,' the suit claimed.

Depp's business manager, Ed White, testified in court earlier this month that Depp and Heard ran up a $160,000 wine bill at Twenty Twenty Wine Merchants by the end of their marriage.

Depp's alcohol and drug use has been a focal point of the trial.

Heard alleged that Depp would get violent during rages fueled by drugs and alcohol. But Depp alleged it was Heard who was the abuser and that she typically drank two bottles of wine a night.

Since the couple's divorce, Depp's tab at the wine company had been nearly eliminated, White testified.

In his own testimony earlier in the trial, Depp didn't deny using cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol regularly, but denied that it became a problem.

He said he sought treatment only when he developed an addiction to the painkiller Roxicodone, a brand name for the drug Oxycodone, which he took for a leg injury.

Most of Depp's guitars are vintage models.

Expensive world-class jewelry

Depp, famed for his unique sense of style which saw him help popularize tattoos, has many 'pieces of expensive world-class jewelry,' which he is often seen wearing, especially his rings.

It was reported that Depp once 'walked into a [high-end jewelry] store, sat for a couple of hours,' an insider said. 'They showed him a lot of stuff, gave him champagne, and he walked out with a $400,000 diamond cuff. It was a classic sort of moment because it wasn't worth $400,000.'

Rare Hollywood collectables

Depp paid the highest bid for the one-eyed horse named Goldeneye from his film Sleepy Hollow, when he learned it had been sent to auction, and took him home with him

Depp spent 'many millions on rare and expensive Hollywood collectables' from the likes of Marilyn Monroe and Marlon Brando. There are so many items that he has 12 storage facilities to house them.

The actor charged more than $500,000 in rental fees for storage warehouses that hold collectibles including $17,000 in handbags and luggage, $7,000 for a Keeping Up With the Kardashians couch as a gift for his daughter, Lily-Rose, TMG claimed in the 2016 lawsuit.

Following the filming of Sleepy Hollow, Depp paid the highest bid for the one-eyed horse named Goldeneye from the film that had been sent to auction, and took him home with him.

Art collection

Actor Johnny Depp auctions Basquiat's 1981 painting 'piece Pork', which was painted on a wooden door and is expected to bring in between $3.5 to $5million

Depp has spent 'millions' to acquire and maintain an expensive art collection, the suit claimed. The collection includes over 200 pieces of art including works by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

One of Basquiat's works, 'Self-Portrait' is one of the pieces he has owned. The art was put up for auction at Christie's in 2016 with a price of over $4.7 million.

Supporting friends and family

Depp has spent millions helping to support 'friends, family and certain employees,' the TMG suit claimed.

At least $10 million was spent for living expenses for his sisters and late mother. He also bought his mother a multimillion-dollar home in Hollywood, and spent $35,000 a month on a residence for her when she was ill.

Depp funded a startup music label run by a childhood friend, which cost him over $4 million with no revenue. He ultimately cut funding.

Depp spent $5 million to fulfill his writer friend Hunter S. Thompson's dream of having his ashes 'blast from a specially made cannon' over Aspen following the writer's death in 2005.

'All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true,' Depp said at the time. 'I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.'

Depp played Thompson in the 1998 movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which is based on Thompson's iconic piece of Gonzo journalism.

Depp and Thompson would regularly meet at Thompson’s farm to shoot his guns and talk about literature, life and other musings, Far Out magazine reported. It was rumored that it was Depp who encouraged Thompson to publish his novella ‘The Rum Diary’.

They remained friends until Thompson shot himself dead at the age of 67.

KARACHI: Newly elected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday assured Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah that the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) project will be included in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)-related projects.

PM Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Karachi on a maiden visit to the metropolitan city after assuming office. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah welcomed PM Shehbaz Sharif upon arrival at the PAF Airbase Faisal. The whole provincial cabinet was present on the occasion.

Later, during a meeting with CM Murad Ali Shah at the CM House, the prime minister assured that the KCR project will be included in the CPEC-related projects.

Matters relating to the current political situation, law and order situation in the city, economy, provincial affairs and other issues were discussed in the meeting, said the spokesperson of the CM.

The chief minister felicitated the Shehbaz Sharif on assuming the office of the Prime Minister and assured him that the Sindh government will work closely with the centre.

During the meeting, the prime minister directed to provide funds for the K-4 project and instructed the WAPDA chairman to complete the water project by 2024.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/uvalde-gun-legislation-senate-deal/,Hopes for quick gun deal fade as Senate negotiators plead for patience,"Senators buckled down Tuesday for days of additional negotiations on a response to recent high-profile mass shootings, retreating from earlier calls for quick action even as they expressed optimism that a long-elusive deal to address gun violence might eventually be possible. The calls for patience came as a small bipartisan group of senators continues delicate talks on a legislative package that could include the first significant new federal gun restrictions in three decades, along with provisions dealing with school security and mental health. But they are fighting a tide of recent history demonstrating that Congress’s appetite for action tends to quickly fade as tragedies such as the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde, Tex., last month fade from the headlines.

Last month, as the Senate prepared to leave Washington for a holiday recess days after the Uvalde shooter killed 19 fourth-graders and two teachers, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) upbraided Republican opponents of gun control and said he would move to a vote if the talks did not “bear fruit in a short period of time.”

Speaking Tuesday, Schumer did not issue any new ultimatum or outline a timeline for action, telling reporters only that the Senate would vote “in the near future.”

“This issue is too important not to do everything we can to find a bipartisan way forward,” he said. “We’re giving [Republicans] the opportunity, the chance, to say yes — we’re ready and eager to find common ground on something that can actually help address gun violence.”

Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also gave an upbeat appraisal of the talks but said it was “way too soon” to predict how many Republicans might ultimately come along. “We don’t have an agreement yet,” he said, adding, “I personally would prefer to get an outcome, and I hope that we’ll have one sooner rather than later.”

McConnell’s remarks came after the top Republican negotiator, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), issued his own plea for patience Monday, counseling his colleagues against setting “artificial deadlines” and warning that consensus legislation would not be ready for a vote this week.

“Good consensus legislation takes time,” he said. “My goal is to achieve a result. And the only way we can do that, the only way we can get a bill that will pass both chambers and earn the president’s signature, is by taking the time and reaching that consensus.”

Senators involved in the negotiations said this week that they have narrowed the list of potential elements to include in a package but that more work is needed. On Tuesday, the top Democratic negotiator, Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), visited the White House to brief President Biden on the talks.

Murphy said afterward that Biden “knows that we’ve got to work out our compromise on our own” and that while he still aimed to strike a deal this week, the Senate may need extra time “to dot the I’s and cross the T’s.”

“Every day we get closer to an agreement, not further away,” he said.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly declined to engage in specifics when asked about Biden’s position on the negotiations but signaled Biden is opening to signing whatever the negotiators come up with, saying “any step is a step forward.”

“His message to negotiators is: We have to do something,” she said.

More far-reaching measures that Biden has endorsed — such as an assault weapons ban, restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines and expansions of background checks to cover private gun sales — are not on the table, the senators said. But the use of federal grants encouraging states to adopt “red flag” laws meant to keep guns out of the hands of potential shooters is under discussion, as is a system to potentially screen gun buyers under 21 for juvenile offenses and mental health episodes.

A proposal that could create a federal minimum age of 21 for rifle buyers, matching the current law for handgun buyers, has not been formally ruled out but is unlikely to make it into a final package, several senators involved in the talks said.

But questions remain about how long the gun debate will remain front and center on Capitol Hill, with serious economic and foreign policy challenges also bearing down on Congress.

The Democratic-controlled House is set to take quicker action. It will begin debating two gun bills Wednesday — one that would create a federal red-flag law as well a package of legislation that includes a minimum age of 21 for semiautomatic rifle purchases and a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines, among other provisions. Those bills, however, have no hope of passing the Senate, where a united minority of Republicans can block legislation because of the chamber’s 60-vote filibuster rule.

Also Wednesday, lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee will hear from a young Uvalde survivor, Miah Cerrillo, and the parents of a victim, Lexi Rubio, in what promises to be searing testimony that could keep public attention focused on the fight for congressional action.

Miah, 11, has publicly described smearing herself in her best friend’s blood and playing dead in order to survive the shooting. She is being represented by Josh Koskoff, a lawyer who successfully represented nine Sandy Hook families in a $73 million settlement with a firearms company that manufactured the weapon used in the 2012 school shooting.

The push has also been lent star power from actor Matthew McConaughey, an Uvalde native who is advocating “gun responsibility” legislation along the lines of what the bipartisan group is considering. The actor, who was spotted roaming the Capitol this week, spoke at Tuesday’s White House press briefing — delivering an emotional appeal for action that drew on his recent travels to Uvalde and conversations with survivors and responders.

“Responsible gun owners are fed up with the Second Amendment being abused and hijacked by some deranged individuals,” he said. “These regulations are not a step back — they’re a step forward for a civil society and the Second Amendment.”

Several of the Senate negotiators said Tuesday that the increasingly fuzzy timeline for action is actually a positive sign, reflecting considerable progress in intensive talks that occurred in phone calls and Zoom meetings over the Memorial Day break and were rekindled in person Monday night, with a meeting between Cornyn and Murphy, along with Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).

“I personally regard an agreement as still a lot of uphill work, with obstacles to overcome,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “But we are closer than ever before.”

While Democrats appear largely open to the modest new restrictions that the negotiators are discussing, some are pushing for votes on more-aggressive measures, such as an assault weapons ban or a 21-and-over law for rifle buyers. On the Republican side, the negotiators are battling fierce skepticism among rank-and-file senators, who argue that new restrictions would simply impede law-abiding Americans while doing little to prevent gun violence.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), for instance, said he was not convinced that raising the minimum age for rifle purchases made any sense, and he expressed sharp skepticism about red-flag laws.

“We have an amendment, a Second Amendment, that guarantees the right” to purchase firearms, he said. “And I just don’t see how you say, well, except if you’re in this category of age. … I just think, you turn 18, you have the right — all the rights afforded adults.”

But Sen. Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.) said she had been struck by the number of calls she had received from constituents wanting to see some action regarding guns and mental health issues.

“Even though our gun culture is strongly pro-hunting and is deeply ingrained in our social fabric, the suicide rate in Wyoming is high,” she said, adding she was “a little surprised … how receptive Wyoming callers seem to be to address guns in some manner.”

Details could prove divisive as the negotiations proceed, potentially derailing the process altogether. On background checks, for instance, Republicans said this week that there is emerging consensus on finding a way to search sealed juvenile justice and mental health records for gun buyers under 18. But doing that search, Tillis said, would take time, raising the prospect of a waiting period for those buyers — something that gun rights groups including the National Rifle Association have fiercely opposed.

The NRA has also opposed red-flag laws, working against their enactment at the state level and seeking to repeal those that have already been passed. “The real purpose of these laws … is simply to empower judges to nullify Second Amendment rights with the stroke of a pen,” the NRA’s lobbying wing wrote in a June 2 article.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has long taken a hard line on gun rights, did not categorically rule out federal red-flag legislation in comments to reporters Monday. But he said that “the details matter” and that those laws “are better considered at the state level.”

But another high-profile GOP senator, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), has emerged as a vocal proponent of red-flag laws — touting Florida’s 2018 law, passed by a Republican legislature after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, as a model.

“I think it’s an effective law,” he said Tuesday. “I don’t know of anyone who is in favor of dangerous people being able to walk into a school and shoot it up. And so there are laws that work that could prevent that from happening, and I think almost everybody that I know would be for it.”",Q2

The filing came to light on Monday, but the shares were bought on 14 March.

Musk is worth some US$270 billion right now and this means he could well look to acquire Twitter if he so wishes.

Twitter's stock rose by about 30% on Monday after news of Musk's buy was known; prior to that the stock has gone up as well, gaining about 50% since 14 March.

Musk tweeted recently about the lack of what he calls free speech on Twitter.

India on Sunday âregistered strong protestâ with Pakistan over the continued targeting of members of the minority community hours after two Sikh men were brutally gunned down in broad daylight by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Peshawar city.

Advertisment

In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said it has asked the authorities concerned to âsincerely investigate the matter and take strict action against those responsible for this deplorable incident.â

""We have seen the reports on the brutal killing of two Sikh traders by unidentified armed men in Peshawar. Sadly, this is not the first such case or a rare occurrence,â it said.

âWe expect that the Government of Pakistan, in discharge of its responsibilities, will look after the safety, security and well-being of its minority communities,â it added.

Advertisment

The deceasedâidentified as Ranjit Singh (42) and Kuljeet Singh (38)â were at their shops selling spices at Batta Tal Chowk in the Sarband area when two assailants arrived on a motorbike and opened fire.

Police have been dispatched to the site to take note of the matter. They are determining whether the deceased were victims of targeted killings.

Around 15,000 Sikhs live in Peshawar, mostly in the Jogan Shah neighbourhood of the provincial capital.

Advertisment

Most of the members of the Sikh community in Peshawar are involved in business, while some also run pharmacies.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has strongly condemned the attack and directed the police to take immediate steps to arrest the culprits.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also denounced the killing, saying, ""Strongly condemn the killing of our Sikh citizens in Peshawar, KP. Pakistan belongs to all its people.â

âHave ordered a high level inquiry to ascertain facts. The killers will be arrested & meted out exemplary punishment. My most sincere sympathies to the bereaved families.""

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-17/sheriff-kobe-bryant-deputy-force-coverups,Kobe Bryant crash photos and Sheriff’s Department use-of-force video collide in courtroom,"Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials attempted to hide an incident in which a deputy kneeled on the head of an inmate for three minutes while the man was handcuffed.

About a year after Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy Doug Johnson took graphic photos of Kobe Bryant’s helicopter crash scene that were then passed around, he was caught up in another scandal.

Johnson knelt on the head of a handcuffed inmate for several minutes — another incident sheriff’s officials tried to keep quiet because they feared it would cast a “negative light” on the Sheriff’s Department.

They have become two of the department’s most highly publicized scandals during Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s term — and they’re now colliding in the courtroom.

L.A. County lawyers are trying to block Vanessa Bryant, Kobe Bryant’s widow, who is suing the Sheriff’s Department for negligence and invasion of privacy over the photo sharing, from introducing the cover-up of the violent detention by Johnson as evidence in her trial, which is set for next month.

The county attorneys are arguing that the force incident and cover-up have “nothing to do with” Bryant’s claims. But they said Bryant’s attorneys would not agree to exclude questions about it during the trial. So they want a judge to decide.

“The incident at the jail and LASD’s response are entirely unrelated to the crash scene photos at issue in this matter,” county attorneys wrote in a filing Friday. “The incident is not only irrelevant, but also highly inflammatory — touching on one of the most contentious issues in our society, accusations of excessive force by police officers.”

County attorneys said in the filing that they called Bryant’s lawyers after the Sheriff’s Department’s handling of Johnson’s force incident, first reported by The Times, became national news and asked if they’d agree not to raise it at trial. Bryant’s lawyers refused, the filing said.

Skip Miller, an attorney representing the county, said in a statement his motion will prevent “the plaintiff from prejudicing the jury by introducing unproven allegations against a witness that have nothing to do with the case.”

Luis Li, an attorney representing Bryant, said Friday: “We look forward to responding in court.”

Advertisement

In both cases, the Sheriff’s Department sought to keep the alleged misconduct under wraps.

Days after the helicopter crash in January 2020, the Sheriff’s Department received a complaint that a young deputy was showing gruesome photos taken at the scene of the tragedy at the Baja California Bar and Grill in Norwalk.

Villanueva through his subordinates ordered the deputies involved to delete the crash photos instead of opening an investigation into the alleged misconduct. It was not until a day after The Times first reported on the photo sharing that the Sheriff’s Department requested an internal affairs investigation, according to internal sheriff’s records attached to a court filing.

Johnson said in a memo to his supervisor that he had a legitimate reason to take the helicopter crash photos, which he said he immediately deleted. Portions of his deposition testimony were also made public in a court filing in Bryant’s case.

He testified that he hiked up to the crash site, where he searched for survivors and taped off the area from hikers. He said he then took 20 to 30 photos of the site, “documenting everything,” including serial numbers and victim remains.

He said he did not think he ever wrote a report on what he documented. Nor did he book the photos into evidence. He texted the photos to a deputy at the command post and AirDropped them to a fire official.

The photos spread from there.

When Johnson was questioned about whether he still had the phone with which he took the photos, he said he lost it the next year while in Las Vegas.

Soon after the photo sharing became public, Johnson was transferred to the Sheriff’s Department’s court services division.

About a year later, deputies were conducting routine searches of inmates at the San Fernando Courthouse before their court appearances when they told two inmates to be quiet.

As the pair continued talking and laughing, Johnson ordered one of them, Enzo Escalante, to stop and face the wall. Escalante, 24, was awaiting trial on charges including murder. Security video obtained by The Times shows Johnson walking closely behind Escalante through a hallway before ushering him toward a wall.

Escalante turned around and punched Johnson in the face multiple times. Johnson and other deputies then took Escalante to the ground, face-down.

After Escalante was handcuffed, Johnson kept his knee on the inmate’s head for three minutes.

Department officials had worried at the time about the negative publicity that could come from a deputy kneeling on a handcuffed man’s head, “given its nature and its similarities to widely publicized George Floyd use of force” images, according to an internal report by a commander critical of the cover-up.

California Fearing bad publicity, LASD covered up case of deputy who knelt on inmate’s head Officials were worried about the optics of the kneeling, “given its nature and its similarities to widely publicized George Floyd use of force,” a commander who was critical of the coverup wrote in an internal force review.

The commander, Allen Castellano, wrote in the July 2021 report that sheriff’s officials decided not to pursue criminal charges against Escalante, to avoid drawing attention to the incident. Sheriff’s officials waited until January — almost a year after the incident — to take the case against the inmate to prosecutors.

Castellano and other high-ranking sheriff’s officials have accused Villanueva of orchestrating the cover-up and lying about it, saying in legal claims filed against the county that he watched the video about five days after the incident occurred in March 2021.

Villanueva claimed that he did not see the video until several months later, and took immediate action.",Q2

Sponsored Content Provided by Triton Charters

San Diego yacht rentals have surged in popularity since the lockdowns started back in 2020 for good reason. Renting a yacht is the ultimate stay-cation retreat. Living it up on a party yacht, feeling the cool breeze of the Pacific and the warm SD sun on your face is an unbeatable experience.

Whether you’re looking for the ultimate bachelorette party idea, celebrating a new job with friends, or even hosting your wedding on the water a yacht will give you the wow effect you’re looking for.

There are over a dozen San Diego yacht rental companies to choose from, so we’ve decided to make it easy and break down the top five. Make it a summer, spring or fall to remember by booking from our list of the best charter companies in town. Let’s get started.

triton-yacht-rental-san-diego[45].jpg

Triton Charters is home to the largest catamaran yacht in all of San Diego at a whopping 75 feet long, and also the top-rated. Although the Triton has only been here for a couple of years it’s made a huge splash on the San Diego yacht rental scene.

It’s 75 feet of pure fun and has already amassed over 135 5 star reviews on Google and 75 reviews on Yelp with a 4.5 star rating. Looking deeper at the Triton will give you a good understanding of why it’s become the most popular yacht charter in San Diego.

It has a 13-seat bar, extra-large dance floor, and an ultra modern design, with plenty of seating in the front and back to allow for large numbers of sunbathers. Their website provides its customers with a 3D Tour of the yacht as well!

Capacity: As the largest catamaran in SD, it comfortably fits up to 100 passengers, which makes it perfect for large events like weddings, vow renewals, corporate events, fundraisers and family reunions. Even if you don’t plan on hosting that many people, the sheer amount of loungeable space makes it a good choice for smaller groups.

Add-Ons: With most SD yacht charter companies in San Diego Bay you’re stuck with the basics. Bartender, local catering and that’s about it. Not with the Triton. The Triton offers a number of adrenaline-inducing add-ons that make it the best party yacht in San Diego. You can choose from low key options like ocean kayaks, paddle boards, and lily pads to splash and sunbathe on.

For the adrenaline junkies they also offer a number of thrilling add-ons like high powered jet skis, electric surfboards and jetpacks. The jetpacks can get up to 35 feet in the air, giving you spectacular views of the bay and city, but for first timers they’ll recommend maxing out around 20 feet.

Triton Charters also has great relationships with local music talent if you’re looking for live music to play your wedding reception, or be serenaded after you pop the question on an engagement cruise. Of course, they have friendly bartenders, djs and local catering for a true party environment.

Pricing: Booking a San Diego yacht rental can be on the pricey side, but Triton is relatively cost effective when considering some of the other options on the water. For up to 40 guests on a 4 hour cruise you’re looking at around $3,300 before add-ons. Other providers can cost over $10,000 for the same experience without add-ons.

Pros:

– Super friendly crew and bartenders.

– Fun add-ons not offered by others.

– Better pricing than competitors.

– Least restrictive deposit policy.

– Hundreds of 5 star reviews.

– White glove planning service for events.

Cons:

– Availability on weekends during peak season. They sell out fast so you should look to book at least a month out.

maalarky-yacht-rental[69].jpg

If you’re looking for something a little smaller your best bet is the Malarky which has been around for over 5 years. It’s a little more than half the size of the Triton, and only fits 12 people which is fine if you’re hosting a smaller gathering.

Like the Triton, it has an indoor lounge that’s a little smaller but comfortable enough for 12 people to take a break from the sun if needed.

Since it made its way to San Diego, it’s been very well received. It’s accumulated 135 5 star reviews on Tripadvisor, 76 5 star reviews on Google and a perfect 5 star rating on Yelp with 28 reviews.

Some of the key mentions in the reviews are that the staff are extremely friendly and experienced. They make every guest feel as though they’re family. As a small, family-owned business they really bring a superior level of customer service.

Capacity: The Malarky is 47 feet long, has a full kitchen, four bedrooms for rest, two bathrooms and plenty of space in the front and back of the catamaran for 12 people. The bow even has a trampoline if you’re feeling like attempting that backflip into the water on a hot day.

Add Ons: The Malarky yacht rental luckily has the same add on options as the Triton like jet skis, electric surfboards and famous jetpacks. Unfortunately, there isn’t a massive bar like on the Triton, so plan on a BYOB situation if you’re looking for a consistent supply of drinks during your trip.

Pricing: The pricing is more reasonable than the Triton, which makes it perfect for proposals, bachelorette/bachelor parties, small family gatherings or celebrations. For a 4 hour cruise through the bay with up to 12 guests you’ll be paying around $2,200. This is about $1,000 less than the Triton, and the Malarky tends to have special discounts occasionally.

Pros:

– All the exciting add on options that the Triton has.

– Extremely friendly and accommodating crew.

– Full kitchen for a cookout on the water.

– Comfortable, shaded seating options in the front and back.

– Spacious indoor lounge for eating and relaxing away from the sun.

– Pricing is more reasonable than the Triton.

Cons:

– Only has a 12 guest capacity.

– Doesn’t have a full bar or bartender as an option. It’s BYOB.

– No dancefloor.

yacht-rental-sd[32].jpg

Yacht Rental San Diego is the only boat rental service that allows the user to input the occasion date, amount of guests, and budget and quickly texts you a list of yachts (and discounts) that fit your needs.

One of the benefits of using this charter company is the fact that you have access to not only different yachts, but also differing capacities that range from 1 person all the way up to 100 people.

Capacity: They utilize 12 different yachts, all with differing capacities, bar options, crew options, and food options.

Add-Ons: Similar to many of the other yacht charter companies, Yacht Rental San Diego can provide lily pads, slides, hosted bars, catering, and more.

Pricing: Ranging from $40 for tickets all the way up to $2,500 per hour.

Pros:

– It’s really nice that they utilize an easy, step-by-step way to get exactly what you want from a yacht. Not only that, but they text your phone with a few different yacht options.

– Availability is typically better than Malarky or Triton due to the fact there are more charter options available.

Cons

– They don’t have the personal touch of event planners like the Triton and Malarky have, so if you’re looking for an event coordinator, look elsewhere.

#4) Luxury Liners

If you’re looking for a more traditional yacht rental in San Diego, Luxury Liners is an option. They have multiple yachts available to choose from, so you can go big or small and can charter for multiple days if you want to travel up to LA and are willing to spend big bucks.

Unlike the Triton or Malarky, Luxury Liners is not a family owned business, it’s more of a marketplace of yachts that you would charter through a broker, meaning they don’t own any of the yachts that they rent.

Because they take a commission on top of the owners of the other businesses, on average, you’re probably going to spend upwards of $6,000 for a 4 hour cruise and not really get the customer service level you can expect with the Triton or Malarky.

However, Luxury Liners has locations all across the world, so if you’re in San Diego and looking to rent a yacht in Florida or Greece, Luxury Liners would likely be your best choice.

Their yachts range from 52 feet to 132 feet, so there is a wide range to suit many event types.

Capacity: Since they have about 20 yachts to choose from, the capacity varies from 12 guests all the way up to 76, but most are limited to 12.

Add-Ons: Unfortunately most of the yachts come with pretty standard add ons like simple flotation devices if you want to go swimming.

Pricing: The average price you’ll pay for a 4 hour cruise with 12 guests will be as low as $4,000 and as high as $23,000 for their most expensive option. As a worldwide yacht broker company, they don’t offer discounts on bookings.

Pros:

– Around 20 options to pick from with varying capacity and yacht types.

– Typically more availability due to more choices.

Cons:

– More expensive than Triton or Malarky.

– Lack of fun add-ons. Standard flotation devices.

– Friendliness of captain and crew can be hit or miss.

– Nonexistent reviews.

– Most offerings aren’t well suited for events/parties.

yacht-charter-san-diego-life[14].jpg

#5) Yacht Life Charters

If options are critical in choosing a San Diego yacht rental, and price isn’t a factor, another option is Yacht Life Charters. Similar to Luxury Liners, Yacht Life Charters is a worldwide yacht broker site with around 18 options in San Diego.

For a 4 hour, half-day yacht rental you’ll spend between $2,100 and $8,500 per charter. They have more cost effective options than Luxury Liners, but capacity maxes out around 50 guests on their largest charter and the average is around 12.

The booking experience, since it’s marketplace, tends to be longer than it would be with a mom and pop like Malarky or Triton, but with 18 choices you’re likely going to have better availability during peak season (May-August).

The available yachts stretch from the smallest, called the Vintage speedster at 25’, all the way to the 105’ Astondoa. They have numerous high end, ultra modern designs, but the available add-ons are lacking compared to Malarky or Triton.

Yacht life charges a deposit of either $1,000 or 50% (whichever is higher) of the total charter cost, which can get pretty steep for some of their more expensive options. Unfortunately, the deposit is non-refundable in most cases so if something comes up at any point after the deposit is paid, you’re likely not getting any of your money back.

Capacity: There are a wide range of capacity options, that go from as low as 10 all the way up to 50 guests on one of their larger rentals. Most of the rentals have a maximum of 12. Most have both interior and exterior lounge space and most have at least 1 bathroom on board. If you’re looking to host a large event like a wedding or fundraiser, there are very few options.

Add-Ons: Similar to Luxury Liners, you really only have the ability to add on simple flotation devices and in some cases paddleboards. If you’re looking for exciting add ons, it’s best to go with Triton or Malarky.

Pricing: Yacht Life has a similar range of pricing to Luxury Liners, but they have a few more lower priced options with their smaller rentals. You’ll be paying about $2,100 for their smallest 4 hour charter and $8,500 for their largest option.

However, they do have membership rates available which can knock about $1,000 off the listed price if you plan on booking multiple charters each year across the world. Their membership rates are a one time fee and cost $2,000, $5,000 or $8,000 for their corporate membership.

Pros:

– 18 options to choose from.

– Range of pricing options

– Discounted rates for paid members.

– Better availability than Triton or malarky, about the same as Luxury Liners.

Cons:

– Must be worked out with a broker.

– Discounts are for paid members only.

– Little to no fun add ons available.

– Non-refundable deposit.

– Zero reviews.

– Most options aren’t ideal for hosting events. Options are best for small gatherings.

https://skift.com/2022/04/05/jetblue-makes-3-6-billion-counterbid-for-spirit-airlines/,JetBlue Makes $3.6 Billion Counterbid for Spirit Airlines,"Does JetBlue's surprise bid for Spirit make sense for the carrier's network? At first glance, Wall Street didn't think so.

JetBlue Airways threw the airline world for a loop with a surprise bid for ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines, that may derail Spirit's planned merger with Frontier Airlines.

JetBlue's $3.6 billion deal offers investors a $700 million premium over the $2.9 billion Frontier-Spirit merger. The New York Times first reported the JetBlue-Spirit news.

Spirit Airlines confirmed that it received an unsolicited offer from JetBlue. The New York-based carrier proposes to acquire ""all of the outstanding shares of Spirit's common stock in an all-cash transaction for $33.00 per share,"" Spirit said in a statement.

JetBlue said its bid is a ""superior proposal,"" compared with Frontier's and offers a 52 percent premium for investors. ""While JetBlue and Spirit are different in many ways, we also have much in common, including a focus on keeping our costs low so we can profitably expand and offer an attractive alternative to the dominant ‘Big Four’ airlines,"" CEO Robin Hayes said in a statement. ""We would conduct a full review of Spirit’s product offering, operational and customer technology, and talent pool to optimize the combined airline.”

Whether the deal is approved remains an open question. JetBlue already is under regulatory scrutiny for its partnership with American Airlines, known as the ""Northeast alliance."" The U.S. Justice Department last year sued to block that partnership, arguing that it would reduce competition on the East Coast. Both American and JetBlue vowed to fight the suit, with then-American CEO Doug Parker saying bluntly, ""We'll win.""

Frontier-Spirit would comprise 7 percent of the U.S. market, while JetBlue-Spirit would be 8 percent, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data via Cirium. In Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, where both JetBlue and Spirit have bases, they would have a combined share of 48 percent and 26 percent, respectively.

A potential deal with Spirit may present fewer regulatory obstacles than the American partnership, but makes less sense for JetBlue. While Frontier and Spirit both operate similar, but not overlapping, low-cost networks geared toward price-sensitive leisure travelers, JetBlue and Spirit are very different airlines. JetBlue's model aims to cater to both leisure and business travelers, with a premium cabin on some aircraft, more international flights — including recently launched London flights — and routes to business destinations, including its hub in New York.

Most analysts believe that a Spirit-Frontier tie up would come under the regulatory microscope but could ultimately be approved by the Biden Justice Department, because the airlines operate complementary networks at the lower end of the market. But the Biden Justice Department has signaled, through its suit to block the northeast alliance, that it is leery of further concentration in the airline — and indeed, in any — industry.

Congressional Democrats also have signaled they have little appetite for further consolidation. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) last month introduced legislation in both houses of Congress to beef up the Justice Department's antitrust oversight and to allow the federal government to unwind mergers deemed anticompetitive. The lawmakers singled out the proposed Spirit-Frontier deal as an example of concentration in one industry going too far.

The U.S. airline industry already is concentrated, especially among full-service, network carriers. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines together fly about 80 percent of all airline passengers in the country. Alaska Airlines handles about 5 percent of all U.S. passengers. Those five airlines themselves are the results of mergers in the 2000s and 2010s: American-US. Airways; Delta-Nortwest; United-Continental; and Alaska-Virgin America.

The market has been skeptical. JetBlue shares fell more than 7 percent immediately after the Spirit news broke.",Q2
https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/58626/10-female-gangsters-you-should-know-about,10 Notorious Female Gangsters,"Idolized and villainized, the American gangster is a character as iconic as the cowboy. Though organized crime tends to be a boys' club, there have been a slate of deadly women who have broken into its ranks. You know John Dillinger, Al Capone, and Bugsy Siegel. But do you know Stephanie St. Clair or The Pretty Pants Bandit? We think it's time that you did.

1. Bonnie Parker

Undoubtedly the most famous of the female American gangsters, Parker was half of the iconic crime duo Bonnie and Clyde. The two were notorious bank robbers in the ""public enemy era"" of 1931 to 1934, when the exploits of outlaws made them celebrities.

Parker was born in Rowena, Texas, where she earned a reputation for being smart and outspoken. She met Clyde Barrow in 1930. Though she was married, the two hit it off immediately. Apart from their robberies and killings, the legend of Bonnie and Clyde grew in part because of a photoshoot they did near their Joplin, Missouri, hideout, images that still inspire re-imaginings of their lives. But those lives were cut short in a gruesome shootout with police in 1934. She was 23; he was 25.

Parker has been portrayed by Dorothy Provine in 1958's The Bonnie Parker Story, by Tracey Needham in the 1992 made-for-TV movie Bonnie & Clyde: A True Story, and by Holliday Granger in the 2013 mini-series Bonnie & Clyde. But best remembered is the sultry turn of Faye Dunaway in the two-time Oscar-winning biopic Bonnie & Clyde.

2. Stephanie St. Clair

She was called ""Queenie"" in much of Manhattan, but in her Harlem home, she was known only as Madame St. Clair. An immigrant of French and African descent, St. Clair set up her numbers bank 10 years after moving to the U.S. and became fiercely protective of her neighborhood. She testified against corrupt cops, getting them fired from the force. Even more impressive, she thwarted the invasion of downtown mobsters once the end of Prohibition sent them uptown in search of new revenue.

With the help of her chief enforcer Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson and an alliance with Lucky Luciano, Madame St. Clair kept the likes of Dutch Schultz out of Harlem. She later gloated when Schultz lay dying from a gunshot wound, sending a note to his hospital bed that read, ""As ye sow, so shall ye reap."" When she retired, St. Clair handed her operation over to Bumpy, who became known as the Harlem Godfather.

St. Clair has been immortalized in two films to date. In 1984, Novella Nelson played her in The Cotton Club. In 1997, she was portrayed by Cicely Tyson in Hoodlum.

3. Opal ""Mack Truck"" Long

Believed to have been born in Texas, Long earned the nickname ""Mack Truck"" because of her size (though it's said no one called her this to her face). She was a member of John Dillinger's Terror Gang, brought in as the wife of Russell Clark. A caretaker by nature, Long—who preferred to be called Bernice Clark—happily cleaned the hideout and cooked for the whole gang, whom she considered family.

Things soured when her husband was arrested in Tucson, Arizona, on January 25, 1934. She attacked the police who made the arrest, and later begged Dillinger for money to fund an appeal of Clark's case. Her demands ultimately ostracized her from the group. That summer she, too, was arrested. She never squealed on her cohorts, yet earned parole by November 1934. She lived out her days in Chicago.

4. Helen Gillis

At 16, Helen Wawrzyniak made a fateful move marrying Lester Gillis, the man who came to be known as Baby Face Nelson. By 20, she had two babies—and a spot on the ""shoot to kill"" list of Public Enemies, thanks to him. She's regarded more as an accomplice than a gangster in her own right, but Gillis was present at the ""Battle of Barrington"" in Illinois on November 27, 1934. There, Nelson spotted a cop car, and with Gillis and fellow thug John Paul Chase in tow, chased it down, guns blazing. This led to a shootout that killed Nelson along with two police officers.

Gillis earned her place on the Public Enemies list by harboring her dying husband. She surrendered on Thanksgiving Day. Bitter over Nelson's ugly demise, Gillis testified against Chase, helping secure his life sentence. She died more than 50 years later, but was buried next to her beloved Baby Face in Chicago's St. Joseph's Cemetery.

5. Ma Barker

Don't let the nickname of this godmother of crime throw you. Arizona Donnie Barker (a.k.a. Kate Barker) was considered a merciless matriarch. At 19, Arizona Clark married George Barker and the two went on to have four sons: Herman, Lloyd, Arthur, and Fred. But the Barkers weren't just a family; they were a crime family, pulling off highway robberies as early as 1910.

These heists led to murder, and soon captivated the press and public of the Midwest. But fate took a turn for the Barkers in 1927, when Herman took his own life to avoid arrest. Shortly thereafter, the other three sons ended up in jail. Arizona faced some lean years, but she reunited with Fred upon his release in 1931, spurring a new crime spree that led to her death and his.

Both were killed when the FBI stormed her hideout in Lake Weir, Florida, on January 8, 1935. Posthumously, her role in the Barker gang has been a matter of debate. Those close to the family insisted she could have played no active role in the criminal dealings of her sons, but J. Edgar Hoover called her ""the most vicious, dangerous and resourceful criminal brain of the last decade.""

The legend of Ma Barker has inspired a slew of malevolent mothers in film and television, from ones seen in the James Cagney gangster classic White Heat to the children's cartoon show DuckTales. But the character of Ma Barker would go on to be played by Jane Crowley in 1959's The FBI Story, Shelley Winters in 1970's Bloody Mama, and Theresa Russell in 1996's Public Enemies.

6. Pearl Elliott

She shared ties with John Dillinger and Harry Pierpont, but Elliott was no hanger-on or gun moll. Instead, she was a notorious madam. She owned a brothel in Kokomo, Indiana, that allegedly enjoyed police protection. To help keep things at her rural establishment safe, they had a system where she'd shine a flashlight out a window to signal for help should a john get out of hand.

Her business also served as a hideout for Pierpont's crew following a 1925 bank robbery. Later, her role as ""treasurer"" for Dillinger earned her a spot on the 1933 Public Enemies list, which ordered officers to ""shoot to kill."" Despite her illegal operation and dangerous dealings, Elliott did not die in a hail of gunfire or in prison. She passed away on August 10, 1935, from an illness that may have been cancer. She was 47.

7. The Pretty Pants Bandit

Described as an attractive brunette with brown eyes and a habit of carrying two guns, this outlaw, known as Marie Baker, grabbed headlines in 1933 for a string of shop robberies committed by her Pants Gang. Baker earned her nickname for her bizarre demand to the shops' clerks. Once all other customers had left, this lingering lady would draw her weapons and command, ""Take off your pants!"" Those too shy to oblige were forcibly helped, with Baker sneering she couldn't be shocked.

The Miami News reported that it was vanity that eventually brought her down. While checking her makeup during a butcher shop heist, Baker allowed a hostage to run free. She was soon caught and booked as Marie Baker. Later, it was uncovered she was in fact Mrs. Rose Durante, who would ultimately serve three years before vanishing into obscurity.

8. Virginia Hill

Known as the Flamingo as well as ""Queen of the Gangster Molls,"" Hill became notorious as the girlfriend of Brooklyn mobster Bugsy Siegel. She came from a poor background, telling people she didn't own a pair of shoes until age 17. Born in Alabama and raised in Georgia, she moved to Chicago to seek fame and fortune. She found a bit of both working as an accountant for Al Capone.

When she moved to Los Angeles to pursue her acting ambitions, she met Siegel, for whom she'd soon be lover and courier. He'd later name his Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas after her. But this proved a bust business, bringing an abrupt end to Siegel's career, and arguably his life. He was gunned down in Hill's Hollywood home on June 20, 1947.

Hill was coincidentally out of the house, and claimed, ""If anyone or anything was his mistress, it was that Las Vegas hotel. I never knew Ben was involved in all that gang stuff. I can't imagine who shot him or why."" Her underworld dealings had her take the stand increasingly as the years went on. In 1961, Hill was found dead in an Austria snowdrift, the victim of an apparent overdose of sleeping pills—although some speculate this too was a hit.

Though Hill never made it as an actress, she did make it to the big screen in 1991, when Annette Bening portrayed her in Bugsy.

9. Arlyne Brickman

Born in 1933 to a Jewish family in East Harlem, Brickman grew up idolizing the glamor and thrills of Virginia Hill. ""In my eyes, here was a broad that really made good,"" she later told biographer Teresa Carpenter. She worked for the mob as a numbers runner, drug dealer, and loan shark. Yet her Jewish heritage was an obstacle to rising up the ranks of the Sicilian-run crime syndicate. Still, the money and power were good enough to please her.

Years later, after a loan shark threatened her daughter, Brickman turned informant. Her spying and testimony ultimately led to the conviction of Anthony Scarpati and several associates for racketeering. In 1992, Brickman told her story in Mob Girl: A Woman's Life In the Underworld.

10. Evelyn ""Billie"" Frechette

She became infamous as John Dillinger's devoted girlfriend, but Frechette came from an unexpected background for a gun moll. A child of French and Menominee descent, she attended Catholic grade school, then went on to graduate from high school. Even with an education, finding work was difficult, which led Frechette to Chicago. After her first husband was jailed for a post office robbery, Frechette met Dillinger, and traveled with him through a cross-country crime spree. The pair survived several shootouts.

She was later convicted for harboring a fugitive, and served two years in prison, during which time Dillinger died. Upon her release in 1936, Frechette spun her criminal past into a new career, setting out on a lecture tour called ""Crime Does Not Pay."" She died of cancer 33 years later.

https://filmschoolrejects.com/top-gun-maverick-review/,‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Really Is That Good,"Let us cut right to the chase: what you have heard about Top Gun: Maverick is true. It lives up to the hype. Tom Cruise is back, baby.

A lot has happened in the nearly four decades since the events of 1986’s Top Gun. Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Cruise) has lived up to his nickname and famous escapades. Higher-ups question why after all these years he has remained a captain. The answer, we learn, is that he just will not give up flying (and disobeying orders).

Maverick soon receives an assignment he cannot refuse and returns to the famous Top Gun flight school to instruct a group of star pilots in the lead up to a dangerous mission. The stakes of Maverick’s return are heightened when he learns that his class of students includes Lieutenant Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of his deceased best friend and former cockpit companion Nick “Goose” Bradshaw. The coincidence may feel a bit too gimmicky to some, but the connection between the two men gives the film an emotional depth lacking in the original. Rooster blames Maverick for his father’s death and keeps him at an emotional distance. Maverick, for his part, must find ways to train Rooster and earn his trust. He must also ensure history does not repeat itself.

Thankfully, Maverick has aged with the actor who plays him. Cruise brings to the role the kind of cool, cockiness that defined young Maverick even if he still has some growing up to do. But he also carries himself with a more measured, thoughtful demeanor apparently developed in the decades that have passed. Maverick is a guy who has seen some shit, who reflects on life as he slowly becomes a father-friend to the pilots he trains.

While the new movie makes up for the lack of interpersonal depth in the original, Top Gun: Maverick still brings the kitschy, bombs-bursting action that will satisfy fans of Cruise and the first film alike. Audiences should appreciate how the new film, directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy; Oblivion), is not overly-steeped in nostalgia. Viewers who have seen the original will naturally smile and cheer a bit more, but one need not have seen Top Gun to appreciate Maverick.

A cast of new and old characters give the film a fresh yet still familiar feel. Jennifer Connelly plays Penny, the local bar owner who dates Maverick. Jon Hamm plays Vice Admiral Cyclone Simpson, Maverick’s demanding boss who often questions his tactics. And Val Kilmer reprises his role as “Iceman,” Maverick’s old flight school friend, now a four-star admiral and commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Each of these characters find ways to push and challenge Maverick as he grows into the role of Top Gun elder statesman.

Readers may remember the film’s tumultuous production history. Originally slated to be released in 2019, shooting delays pushed the film to 2020. The pandemic, naturally, then caused a series of further delays. Cruise, in his role as star and producer, has spoken publicly about his commitment to the theatrical experience. He insisted that Maverick not debut via streaming. We should all be grateful that he did.

Maverick is a shot of adrenaline right to the eyes and ears. Even more so than the film’s enveloping visuals, the sound design and music seemingly simulate the experience of flying. Wind, explosions, enemy fire, and engine roars all pour over the viewer. Such audiovisual disorientation creates a sonic portrait of Top Gun piloting and flying when the stakes are at their absolute highest. The sounds of the naval air base are made all the more rich when paired with the film’s soundtrack, which features an original theme song by Lady Gaga.

Perhaps the most admirable quality of Top Gun: Maverick is that it never pretends to be anything other than what its core audience wants it to be: a thoughtful, finely-crafted action film that will wow audiences with its sounds and images. The film is escapism at its finest. Audiences who have waited years for Maverick’s return will be more than satisfied with the end result.

The nostalgia audiences may feel while watching Maverick may have less to do with Top Gun and more to do with Cruise, who belongs to that dying breed known as “movie star.” To watch Tom Cruise, his faults and all, is to watch the living embodiment of film history. To witness a genre hero whose style of filmmaking may not ever exist again.

The history of Hollywood is the history of the star vehicle and of making films that showcase the unique skill sets of its greatest artists. One cannot tell the history of film without mentioning Tom Cruise. Getting to see the man in his element, reprising and evolving in one of his signature roles, is cinema at its finest. And it’s also a damn pleasure to just simply watch.",Q2
https://dailytimes.com.pk/940636/long-march-test-for-judges-and-neutrals/,Long march ‘test’ for judges and ‘neutrals’,"Pledging to go ahead with the ‘Azadi March’, PTI Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan Tuesday said he will see whether the judiciary and ‘neutral’s will support ‘thieves and servants of America or support the real independence of Pakistan’.

Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, Imran said he will lead the “biggest procession in Pakistan’s history”.

Criticizing the government, Imran said Sharif family was adopting the same tactics that military dictators had been doing since 1985.

“They only remember democracy as soon as they leave power,” he said, asking how many times these parties had taken to the streets throughout the PTI government’s term.

“They entered the houses of people and didn’t care for the privacy of women,” he said, adding that the PTI government never tried stopping the then opposition leaders from exercising their right to assemble and stage protests.

He then asked if the PTI government had made any arrests when the PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and JUI-F chief Fazlur Rehman marched towards Islamabad.

He condemned that the police entered the house of a retired army major while referring to a video that surfaced on the social media, in which a girl could be in seen tears claiming that the cops had “harassed” her.

“Do we want to make the country Quaid-e-Azam’s Pakistan or the Pakistan of these thieves and robbers?” Imran Khan asked and said 60% of the federal cabinet comprised criminals who were roaming freely after attaining bails, while they still had cases of corruption worth Rs24 billion against them, says a news report. “The crime minister and his son had to be sentenced but now they are making decisions for the country,” he said and claimed that the PTI had not broken any law in its 26 years of political history. Imran said that it was the democratic right of his party to carry on with the said that PTI’s “Azadi March” is the party’s democratic right.

“W e are marching to Islamabad because it was proved in the National Security Council (NSC) meeting that a foreign conspiracy was hatched and the [PTI] government was toppled,” Khan said, adding that those who have been criminals for the last 30 years were brought into power.

Calling out to the judiciary of Pakistan, the PTI leader said that the courts’ reputation would be tarnished if it permitted what was happening in the country and their silence would “prove that there was no democracy in the country”. “We are noting the names of each and every official and bureaucrat. Our message to the bureaucracy is that action will be taken against them if they follow illegal orders,” he said.

Khan asked the bureaucracy of Punjab how they could follow the orders of Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shahbaz, saying “he [Hamza] doesn’t have a majority vote”. He also warned the authorities of action against every unlawful order they follow. The PTI chairman asked his supporters to “break the chains of fear” while citing the example of how the Afghans fought foreign powers. Khan said that the government could not put a sea of people, who were willing to march to Islamabad in his support, in jail.

The former prime minister then said that the entire nation was “looking towards the neutrals” to intervene. “You will also be responsible if the country moves towards destruction,” he said. “I have a message for the neutrals, judges, and lawyers: it is a decisive time. I ask the judiciary and neutrals what kind of a government they want”.

“We will see whether you support these thieves and servants of America or support the real independence of Pakistan,” the ex-PM said. He then asked, “what kind of treason was being committed in Pakistan that PTI’s MNAs had to be arrested”. Speaking about the economic condition of Pakistan, Imran said the PTI had clearly said that the situation was getting worse but the incumbent government ruined the economy in just 1.5 months.

He said that there was only one solution to all the problems the country was facing: immediate elections. Khan warned that he “feared that Pakistan would witness the same fate as Sri Lanka”. He urged the youth, which he also referred to as the “attack force”, to power through all obstacles placed by the government on their way to Islamabad. Imran said he hoped the youth already knew its responsibilities. “Our attack force, comprising all of you, will be responsible to remove all impediments when we begin our march tomorrow,” Imran said.

He told his supporters to consider the march as “jihad” and not politics. “You must prepare yourselves [in advance] as the government might suspend mobile networks and target other communication modes.” He said his struggle would continue until the marchers got an election date, assemblies were dissolved and the imported government was sent packing. Commenting on last night’s raid at the home of retired Justice Nasira Iqbal, he said: “Her house was raided last night […] I want to ask the neutrals and the judiciary, the scenes that you are witnessing, what kind of government can do this? Not a democratic one.” He asserted that he would lead a rally from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Islamabad tomorrow, saying that for him this was no longer about politics but was a “jihad”. Imran alleged that the current government had been brought into power by the United States because it would bend over backwards for them.",Q2
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/14/us-to-address-killing-of-american-citizen-directly-with-israel,US to address killing of American citizen ‘directly’ with Israel,"Palestinian rights advocates call for US sanctions on Israeli unit involved in the killing of 80-year-old Omar Assad.

The United States will address the death of elderly American citizen Omar Assad, who was killed by Israeli forces last year, “directly” with Israel after the country’s military announced that it will not pursue criminal charges in the case.

Early in 2022, Assad, who was 80 years old, suffered a stress-induced heart attack after he was arbitrarily detained, bound, blindfolded and gagged by Israeli forces, and then left out unresponsive on the ground at a cold construction site in the occupied West Bank.

The Israeli army said on Tuesday that it found no “causal link” between the way its soldiers treated Assad and the American citizen’s death.

The US Department of State, which often reiterates that the safety of Americans abroad is its top priority, said on Wednesday that it was looking into the Israeli findings.

“We’re aware of the conclusion of the investigation, and we’re at this time seeking more information from the Israeli government about it,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. “We’re going to talk to them directly about it.”

Miller said Washington expected “full accountability” in the case early on.

“We have been clear about our deep concern on the circumstances surrounding Omar Assad’s death and the need for such accountability,” he added.

Leahy Law

Assad was one of two US citizens killed by Israel last year – the other, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, was fatally shot by Israeli forces while covering a raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.

Israeli authorities rarely ever prosecute abuses by their forces against Palestinians, but the US vehemently opposes Palestinians’ efforts to seek accountability at the International Criminal Court, including in the case of Abu Akleh.

Israel, accused of imposing a system of apartheid by leading human rights organisations like Amnesty International, receives at least $3.8bn of US aid annually.

President Joe Biden and his top aides often stress Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to Israel.

Adam Shapiro, director of advocacy for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a US-based rights group, called for meaningful accountability for the killing of Assad.

He said the Biden administration should apply the Leahy Law, which bans American aid to foreign forces engaged in gross violations of human rights, to Israel’s Netzah Yehuda unit that was involved in the killing of Assad.

Shapiro added that the State Department has been looking at the case from the perspective of the Leahy Law after DAWN submitted a referral to the US government last October, which underscored that the blindfolding of Assad violated Israeli regulations.

“We believe that that process should not only continue, but that this closure of the Israeli investigation requires the State Department to now apply Leahy Law sanctions to the unit,” Shapiro told Al Jazeera.

He added that by blindfolding Assad, Israeli soldiers “took an action that was deliberate and intentional that was a violation of their own rules”. He said the Palestinian autopsy report on the death of Assad noted that the gagging and blindfolding of the elderly US citizen contributed to his heart attack.

“We have a direct line of causation from the deliberate illegal actions by the Israeli soldiers to the death of Assad,” Shapiro said.

‘Same message’

For his part, Osama Abuirshaid, executive director of American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), raised concern about the State Department statement on Wednesday.

“It’s the same message – ‘We’re following up; we’re in touch with our Israeli counterparts; we are demanding an investigation by the Israelis.’ But when the outcome of an investigation is released, and it does not meet the expectations, we don’t see an American response,” Abuirshaid told Al Jazeera.

In February 2022, Washington welcomed an Israeli report that said the death of Assad “showed a clear lapse of moral judgment” and announced disciplinary action against the commander of the Netzah Yehuda unit.

“The United States expects a thorough criminal investigation and full accountability in this case,” the State Department said at that time.

Abuirshaid said that if the Biden administration does not impose consequences on Israel for killing Assad, it would be abdicating its responsibility to protect US citizens.

“Our problem is not only with Israel and its mistreatment of American citizens, but our problem is mainly with our own administration – with our own government here – that allows Israel to continue its mistreatment of American citizens,” Abuirshaid said, also citing the killing of Abu Akleh.",Q2
https://mymixfm.com/2022/04/14/momentum-builds-to-solve-2004-mooresville-killing-of-young-woman/,Momentum builds to solve 2004 Mooresville killing of young woman,"MOORESVILLE, Ind. — Ronli Ratliff wasn’t necessarily supposed to be at her little-used family home at 5354 East Dayhuff Road overnight on April 14, 2004.

The water line at her apartment in Mooresville had broken, and the 24-year-old woman wanted to practice her brush stroke for painting at the house.

“She called me about 9 o’clock wanting to know where the art supplies were, so I told her,” said Ronli’s mother, Sandra Allen. “That was the last time I talked to her.”

Ratliff had worked in banking off-and-on, said Allen, and was committed to spending the rest of her life in Morgan County.

“She wouldn’t leave mom, and I wouldn’t leave her,” said Sandra. “She was searching in life. She just hadn’t really found her focus yet. She basically just got there. She’d enrolled recently in some art classes, thought she found her purpose and where she wanted to go in life.”

Allen and her husband owned an auto body shop and towing company in Mooresville the night her daughter was murdered.

“At the body shop and wrecker service we have radios. It came across the radio that there was a fire at our house,” said Allen. “I was terrified because I know she’s there, and I’m not hearing anything else, just the fire.”

Darrell Brown was a member of the Mooresville Fire Department and responded to the scene that day.

“One of the crews found her pretty quickly, I recall,” he said. “The fire was just limited to the origin and the area where the victim was found.”

Investigators have never released Ratliff’s cause of death.

“I have no idea why anyone would want to hurt her,” said Allen. “If it was towards her, a break in, I have no idea, and that’s why we need to know. Was it something against us and our business? Its just…”

Allen’s voice trailed off in search of answers.

Several miles away, in a sheriff’s office conference room, a cold case team of five retired investigators and an administrative assistant gathered on a Sunday afternoon to talk about a homicide that has haunted Morgan County for 18 years.

“She was a good kid,” said Dan Riffle, who retired from the Martinsville Police Department to take up the investigation into Ratliff’s murder. “Whoever did this needs to be punished. Needs to be held accountable and needs to be punished because if he’s done it once, he’s gonna do it again, if he hasn’t done it again already.”

Retired FBI agent John Gray is confident investigators know who the killer is.

“I think we’ve talked to the killer, in my opinion, throughout the investigation. They have been interviewed,” he said. “My key guy, if you will, is living homeless in Speedway until we indict him and arrest him for the murder itself. He’s long been a suspect, he’s still into narcotics.”

Gray said he’s ready to bring suspects, persons of interest and witnesses in for more intensive questioning.

“I am working with the prosecutor to consider a grand jury with some of the information that we’ve developed. The individuals involved in that, the targets of that grand jury, still reside even in Indiana, and one removed himself to Tennessee with his family immediately after the murder.”

Investigators have tracked vehicles spotted at the scene of the killing, cellphone calls, computer searches and interviewed witnesses who claim to know what happened, including one man who quit talking once the questions hit too close to home.

“He was basically cooperative until the time frame that we were interested in,” said Gray, “and then suddenly he has amnesia and can’t remember what he took part in.”

“This whole investigation has been like this giant oak tree. Every time you interview somebody, a new name pops up or a new group of names pop up or a new rumor pops up,” said Riffle. ”As far as anybody who has been eliminated, there’s only been a couple, Ronli’s parents, and I don’t think they were involved.”

Brown, the retired firefighter, said in 18 years, memories fade, witnesses die, people want to forget.

“They have moved on with their life. That life that they may have been living at that time in the past, that’s a ghost in the fog that they’d just as soon forget, and they’re not gonna offer that up unless we ask them.”

“A lot of people are reluctant to talk to us because they think this is a drug case,” said Gray, “that they’re going to jail for narcotics, and we consistently tell them, ‘This is a homicide case, and we’re interested in the homicide. The statute of limitations has run on the drug part of this part of it.’ But people tell us that they’re afraid because their former dealers will come after them. ‘Who’s coming after you?’”

Riffel said the hard drive of one computer found in the home has been analyzed, and another is being examined by Indiana State Police.

“We assume she was searching dating websites, and there was a piece of paper in front of that computer that was collected as evidence, and she had written down a name and an address. I have researched that name and address and came up with that individual, and that individual has moved something like 47 times within the last few years,” said Riffel. “There were some other things in that computer that I found that was strange for her to research, and that research was done days prior to the homicide.”

Former Beech Grove Police Chief Rich Witmer has looked at the Ratliff case files for six years.

“I do definitely think this case is solvable,” he said.

Speaking publicly for the first time about her daughter’s death, Allen said she has faith that investigators are making progress in solving the murder.

“I’m really thankful that the cold case team has come on because without that we wouldn’t have anything. With them on it, that gives me a little relief that we don’t have to concentrate on her death every day. We can concentrate on her life and let them handle that.”

Allen is mystified how such a small community can keep such a horrendous secret for nearly two decades.

“I don’t know if she invited someone in. I just don’t know. Because we are such a small town, you would think after 18 years there would be some kind of gossip, or somebody would know something and not be able to hold it this long. I know the torment I’ve lived with the last 18 years, so I hope whoever did this, I hope their torment is 10 times more than what I’ve even had to, or even 100 times more.

“We’re a small town, and everybody knew what everybody was doing, so why doesn’t anybody know what happened here?”

As per the reports, the Nepalis were also subjected to torture by these Pakistanis after being abducted.

""The Turkish government has tightened the visa policy for Pakistanis after crimes reportedly involving Pakistanis,"" reported Arab News quoting Pakistani media outlet, Aaj News.

Security guard killed

Unidentified robbers killed a security guard and looted Rs8.3 million from a cash van in the Dhamyal area of Rawalpindi on Monday.

According to police, as the crew of the cash van approached Zafar Plaza to deliver cash at a money exchange shop on Dhamiyal Road, three armed robbers in a vehicle showed up and attempted to snatch cash from the staff.

When the security guard named Nisar resisted, one of the robbers opened fire. As a result, the security guard was fatally injured. A moment later, he succumbed to his injuries while the robbers decamped with the looted cash.

https://www.noozhawk.com/article/from_our_inbox_letters_to_the_editor_for_the_week_ending_june_10_2022,"From Our Inbox: Letters to the Editor for the Week Ending June 10, 2022","I don’t consider myself a “gun-hugger,” but as a constitutionalist I guess I am according to Randy Alcorn’s June 5 commentary, “Tell the Gun-Huggers That Guns ARE a Public Safety Issue.” I don’t have the energy to refute each of his regurgitated anti-Second Amendment talking points, but I will make a couple of my own.

Alcorn, like President Joe Biden’s feebled memories, touts the success of the 1994 “assault” weapons ban as fact. In fact, the opposite is true.

But don’t take my word for it. The link Alcorn included in his own commentary goes to that noted right-wing website, Wikipedia, where the contrary evidence is outlined right there in the third paragraph.

More important, there are several things that Biden could do right now, with no need of congressional action, to put a big dent in gun crime, starting with enforcing gun laws that are already on the books.

Most gun crime is committed by repeat criminals in possession of guns they’re not legally allowed to possess — a felony in itself. Why not start by taking those guns instead of going after legally owned firearms from law-abiding citizens who use them for protection and recreation, and have never even thought of committing a crime?

Many of those illegally obtained guns are acquired from a licensed gun dealer only by outright lying on the purchase application. Biden’s own son, an admitted drug addict, apparently obtained a handgun by lying about his addiction on his application. He violated the law. Prosecute him for the felony.

The fact that no one is even talking about this “low-hanging fruit” gives away the lie from the anti-Second Amendment crowd. Stopping CRIME isn’t the objective, taking away the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens is.

Regarding Hib Halverson’s June 3 letter to the editor, progressives are not “coveting the status quo” as he puts it. In fact, being a progressive educator means you are always looking for more effective instructional strategies to reach the children in your classroom, your school or your district.

Progressive educators think about individual children and what their specific needs are. Does this child need support emotionally to try again when things are challenging? Does that child respond better to direct commands or invitations to modify their behavior?

Progressive educators ask, “How can I make this information relevant to the lives of the students in front of me?” Progressive educators know that children learning English as a second or third language need to feel valued and supported, even celebrated, for their capacity to be literate in more than one language!

“Status quo” is not attending to the daily context of the learning community.

Newly re-elected Santa Barbara County schools Superintendent Susan Salcido has not ignored the various needs of the different county schools. From Santa Maria to Ballard, large and small, the county Education Office has responded to their different needs.

It has a vibrant grants program supporting new teachers entering the field in special education with the goal of keeping locals, local. It has a strong administrative services program for teachers who are earning their administrative credential. It has an excellent teacher induction program to support new teachers.

In the last four years, our county schools achieved accreditation from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Political pressure isn’t the same as professional accountability and it shouldn’t be a substitute for responsible, research-based change.

Santa Barbara County schools needs a steady, consistent leader who will rise to the occasion, whether it is a pandemic or multiple lockdowns in our schools, or supporting something more like what schools are for, helping every student find a pathway in life that fulfills their dreams. Susan Salcido had my vote.

If you did not vote June 7, why not?

Something appears to be seriously wrong as indicated by the significantly, historically record-breaking low voter turnout of only 21% on election night of 234,212 registered voters.

Historically in statewide, nonpresidential primary years 37% to 45% of registered voters in Santa Barbara County cast a ballot. In presidential primary years, up to 58% of locals voted.

Are most registered voters too busy packing up to leave “once-golden California” for states not yet transformed, reinvented or third world? Or has the local majority decided their single party-controlled life realities can’t be changed?

End the speculation: Why did 79% of registered locals not vote? I’m packing up, but I made time to study and then cast my vote.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2350811/opp-senses-conspiracy-as-pa-session-evades-voting-on-cm-slot,Opp senses ‘conspiracy’ as PA session evades voting on CM slot,"The opposition in Punjab termed the government’s conduct of adjourning assembly’s proceedings before initiating voting for the provincial top slot as a “conspiracy” against their constitutional right.

Members of the ruling PTI and the opposing PML-N traded barbs during the session, causing it to be adjourned. The media was barred from coverage from the press gallery of the Punjab Assembly.

The session, chaired by Deputy Speaker Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari, witnessed tensions between the two sides as a group of women lawmakers belonging to the ruling party moved towards the opposition benches for the recovery of three of their colleagues who had switched sides. However, the matter was dealt with in a peaceful manner.

Later, as the deputy speaker started introducing nominees’ names, the said lawmakers made another attempt, which evolved into a fiery argument, and led to the ruling party using abusive language against the opposition. During this episode, a woman lawmaker belonging to the PML-N was slightly injured.

This prompted the deputy speaker to adjourn the session. Interestingly, this happened minutes after the National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri rejected the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan and wrapped up the lower house session.

Following the adjournment, PTI pinned the blame on PML-N, saying they only wanted to bring their three lawmakers back to the treasury benches, but were prevented by the opposition party from doing so.

On the other hand, the PML-N lawmakers made it clear that the PTI lawmakers were with them, and the ruling party wanted to take them back forcefully while they did not want to return.

As the house’s proceedings were adjourned till April 6, PML-N lawmakers staged a protest in the assembly chambers, but as the lights went off, they came to the sitting area. When the lights of this area were also switched off, water in the premises’ washrooms was also stopped. The lawmakers were not allowed to get food for Iftaar delivered as well, but when they were finally granted access, they used their mobile phones’ flashlight to have their meal.

Meanwhile, PML-N also decided to knock the doors of the Supreme Court (SC) against the provincial government’s conduct. Attaullah Tarar told The Express Tribune that when the chief minister had resigned, the schedule for the election had been issued, nomination papers had been submitted and the voting date had been fixed, there was no need for adjournment.

He termed the government’s act as “unconstitutional”, adding that this was why they were approaching the apex court.

When asked why they were approaching the top court instead of any other forum, he said that the matter had already been taken by the SC.

Earlier, while leaving the assembly’s premises, PML-Q leader and nominee for the provincial top slot Chaudhry Pervez Elahi said that PML-N wanted to escape, therefore it created a ruckus in the assembly. He also claimed that the PTI had enough numbers to emerge victorious.

When asked about Chaudhry Sarwar’s dismissal from governorship, former chief minister Usman Buzdar said that it was the prerogative of the PTI to replace the governor for provincial interests.

PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz, another contender for chief ministership, said that the nation and institutions were fully aware about the sensitivity of matters. He said that disgruntled PTI leaders Jahangir Khan Tareen and Aleem Khan had fallen prey to the “vested interests” of Prime Minister Imran.

He alleged that the ruling party had not served democracy, and all its acts were meant to derail the country.

Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office (LCSO) Assistant Director of Corrections Vicki White and suspected killer Casey Cole White vanished without a trace on Friday morning after leaving the local jail together, according to authorities.

The sheriff’s office said that Ms White, who is no relation to the inmate, picked him up from the detention centre at around 9.30am claiming that she was to take him for a mental health evaluation at Lauderdale County Courthouse.

She told her coworkers that once she had escorted him to court she was going to seek medical attention for herself as she felt unwell.

They never arrived at the courthouse and neither the corrections officer nor the inmate have been seen since.

Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said at a press conference on Friday that they have since learned that there was no mental health evaluation or court appointment scheduled for Mr White on Friday.

Ms White’s 2013 Ford Taurus patrol car was found abandoned in the parking lot of a nearby shopping centre at around 11am Friday, the sheriff said.

But the alarm was only raised several hours later, at around 3.30pm, when Ms White’s coworkers grew concerned that she hadn’t returned and were unable to reach her by phone.

It was only then that they also realised that Mr White had also not returned to jail.

A search is now underway to track down the pair with the sheriff warning that the corrections officer is “in danger”.

“Knowing the inmate, I think she’s in danger whatever the circumstances,” he said.

“He was in jail for capital murder, and he had nothing to lose.”

Officials are assuming that Mr White is now armed with the corrections officer’s 9mm handgun and are urging the public not to approach the “extremely dangerous” escapee but to call 911 with any sightings.

Sheriff Singleton said that Ms White, who coordinates all inmate transportation, broke protocol by taking the inmate out of the jail alone.

Due to the severity of charges against Mr White it is policy that he must be escorted by two sworn deputies at all times including when he is transported to and from the courthouse.

However, officials said they are keeping an open mind about the circumstances surrounding their disappearance, saying that they are exploring all possibilities including that Ms White may have been kidnapped or may have helped the inmate escape.

“Whether she assisted him or not, we don’t know, and we won’t address that until we have absolute proof that that’s what happened,” said the sheriff.

“We are assuming at this point that she was taken against her will, unless we can absolutely prove otherwise.”

Vicki White said she was taking the inmate to the courthouse (Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office)

Ms White has been “an exemplary employee” for the department for the last 25 years and had been talking about retiring soon, the sheriff said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/oklahoma-ban-abortions.html,Oklahoma Legislature Passes Bill Banning Almost All Abortions,"The measure is modeled on a law that took effect in Texas in September, which banned abortion after about six weeks and has relied on civilian instead of criminal enforcement to work around court challenges. Because of that provision — the law explicitly says state authorities cannot bring charges — the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts have said they cannot block the ban, even if it goes against the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade.

The Oklahoma ban goes further than the Texas law, which bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.

The bill defines an unborn child as “a human fetus or embryo in any stage of gestation from fertilization until birth.” Anti-abortion groups, believing abortion to be murder, have tried unsuccessfully since the 1973 Roe decision to pass federal or state legislation defining life as beginning at fertilization.

The vote on Thursday was the latest step by Oklahoma’s Republican-led Legislature, working alongside Mr. Stitt, to chip away at abortion rights until the procedure is all but outlawed entirely. Together, they have put their state at the head of the pack of Republican-led states rushing to pass laws that restrict or prohibit abortion in anticipation that the Supreme Court is soon likely to overturn Roe. A leaked draft opinion written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. — along with oral arguments in the case at hand, regarding a Mississippi law that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy — indicated that the court was prepared to do so.

In Oklahoma, outnumbered Democrats in the State House pleaded with their colleagues not to pass the bill on Thursday. Several urged instead for Oklahoma to focus more on funding for family planning services, or on improving the lives of young Oklahomans living in poverty.",Q2
http://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-transgender-politics-20220605-dryl55523zeq5izujeceeer3zi-story.html,"Warren Binford and Mary Kelly Persyn: Politics, not doctors, place transgender children at risk","Gender-affirming care is not child abuse. So say experts from the nation’s leading organizations in the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect, including the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children and our nation’s oldest academic center in the field, the Kempe Center.

These are just two of numerous medical, legal, and child welfare organizations that recently offered their expertise to the Texas courts in Doe vs. Abbott, a lawsuit brought by a family challenging a directive by the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, ordering that state’s child welfare agency to investigate all families seeking gender-affirming care for their children and all doctors providing it.

The Texas Supreme Court recently sided with the family in Doe v. Abbott. The court made very clear that there was no legal basis for either the governor’s directive nor the attorney general opinion on which it was based.

Elsewhere in Texas, another court defended a doctor’s right to provide gender-affirming care, at least for now. And a federal court in Alabama granted an injunction barring enforcement of the provision of a new state law that bans medication therapies. In that opinion, the court made clear that its decision was informed by expert medical opinion, not political grandstanding.

At a time when political divisions and partisanship threaten to upend society, it is more important than ever to ensure that social policies are informed by research and evidence, not misinformation and hysteria, especially when it comes to children in their formative years. Thus, Yale faculty published a report refuting point-by-point the allegation that gender-affirming care is child abuse and the American Academy of Pediatrics filed an amicus brief in Texas explaining that gender-affirming care for youth is, in fact, life-saving medical care, supported by every major health care association in the United States.

When the research is examined, one learns that transgender identity is relatively common. Almost one in 150 Americans ages 13-17 are transgender, according to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System . No wonder the American Medical Association advised U.S. governors that trans and non-binary gender identities are “normal variations of human identity and expression.”

It appears that transgender identities are not the issue, but rather their social and political rejection by some. The growing body of research shows that gender-diverse youth who are supported in their identity follow gender development profiles similar to cisgender youth. Indeed, research shows that transgender youth are relatively normal teenagers with similar levels of self-esteem and depression compared to cisgender youth when their identities are affirmed by their families, friends, and communities.

However, when transgender youth do not receive affirming love and care, they suffer. According to a survey just released by The Trevor Project, 94% of LGBTQ youth reported in 2022 that current political attacks were taking a toll on their mental health. Over half of America’s gender-diverse youth have seriously considered suicide in the past year. Having one affirming adult in their life cuts the risk of suicide by 30%.

If we as a society are truly committed to the prevention of child abuse, let’s stop using politics to attack kids and instead start trying to understand and accept them, shall we?

Pro-abortion protesters marched upon Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s home Monday, despite the illegality of protesting on someone’s private property in the state of Virginia. The smallish-sized group’s go-to chant was “Abort the Court” while others screamed “F*** Alito” from behind their face masks. Super original, guys.

The crowd has started to chant “abort the court.” Others are screaming “F Alito!” pic.twitter.com/9Y9AHjZEKp — Douglas Blair (@DouglasKBlair) May 10, 2022

Along with the incoherent screaming came chants of random numbers. I assume the woman yelling them was wearing a face mask outdoors so it’s tough to know exactly what she was saying, but her random noise concluded with the crowd shouting, “You can’t even find the clit” and then “you don’t care if people die.”

Ahhh who doesn’t love the sweet smell of hypocrisy at dusk? Nothing better than a pro-baby murder parade claiming that returning abortion laws to the states is a death sentence for women.

Of course, the best part of any protest is the signage. One video shows the creative genius of banners featuring a coat hanger with “Don’t Go Back” written underneath. Another protester held up a sign reading “I am not free if you control my womb” while wearing a face mask and freely choosing to have one of the worst haircuts in the history of humanity. My personal favorite from this next clip is the middle-aged man holding a banner that reads “Get The F**k Out” and showing a middle finger over a woman’s vagina.

The main banner guiding the pro-abortion protestors to Alito’s home read “Repro Freedom For All!” but it was hard to tell how many of the protestors were there for reproductive rights and how many were there from the press, as can be seen from this next video. According to a follow-up video, no more than 100 people showed up to protest, while almost everyone else there was a journalist.

A young woman wearing a graduation gown talks to an investigator within the crime scene of a shooting at Xavier University in New Orleans, Tuesday, May 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)

Original Publication Date May 31, 2022 - 12:36 PM

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — An elderly woman was killed and two males wounded when an argument between two females erupted into gunfire Tuesday at a university campus after a high school graduation there, New Orleans police said.

The males received wounds that were not life-threatening — one hit in a shoulder, the other in a leg, authorities told news outlets. Police did not give their ages.

The gunfire occurred about 11:45 a.m. near the Xavier University of Louisiana Convocation Center, where Morris Jeff Community School held its high school graduation Tuesday morning.

A little more than an hour later, investigators were setting evidence cones near empty shell casings, a pair of shoes, and a handgun that lay near a minivan with a flat tire. Others were using cellphones to take photographs through the windows of a car.

A man comforted a young woman in a graduation gown as they sat at the rear of a minivan inside the parking lot marked off with crime scene tape — a lot about the size of a city block. Crime scene tape marked another vehicle about a block away, with an officer posted there.

Deputy Superintendent Chris Goodly told reporters he did not know whether the people who fought in the parking lot were the ones who pulled guns, or how many guns or bullets were fired.

Three people were being questioned, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported.

“Multiple subjects were detained at the scene for questioning. No arrests have been made as of this writing,” police said in a news release around 3 p.m.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards noted that the shooting came two weeks after four people were wounded in a shooting outside another high school graduation at Southeastern Louisiana University.

“Those who perpetuate these senseless acts of violence will be brought to justice,"" Edwards said. ""We must do more to keep our communities safe, and this means we must do more to ensure that those who pose an unacceptable risk of harm to others aren’t able to acquire or keep firearms.

“In light of recent gun violence in Buffalo and Uvalde, gun safety discussions and action involving expanded background checks and red flag laws are very much in order.”

The shooting comes as New Orleans is grappling with rising homicides. The Metropolitan Crime Commission reported 120 homicides as of May 30, up from 80 a year earlier and 51 at this time in 2019 — a year when killings marked a 49-year low.",Q2
https://dailytimes.com.pk/940475/ihc-directs-police-to-avoid-harassing-political-workers/,IHC directs police to avoid harassing political workers,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday directed the police to avoid harassing political activists and leaders on a petition filed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).

Chief Justice Athar Minallah, who heard the case filed by the PTI against the alleged arrest of its workers and closure of roads, also served notices to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Deputy Commissioner Islamabad. Petitioner’s lawyer Barrister Ali Zafar pleaded that a peaceful protest was the basic constitutional right of every citizen, but the PTI leaders were being arrested across the country through a crackdown. The chief justice said there was a clear judgment of the Supreme Court in a case pertaining to protest and staging sit-ins.

However, the court could not pass an order only on the basis of assumptions, he added. The lawyer said the activists of a political party could not be stopped from arranging a gathering. The court said it was giving instructions to implement the laws in light of the judgment of the top court. It asked the petitioner to first avail permission from the district administration for political gathering.

Barrister Ali Zafar said the matter was not related to the permission instead it was related to the arrest of party workers. The chief justice said the court could not pass a general order. He asked the lawyer whether he could submit an affidavit that no untoward incident would take place and if, otherwise, then he would be responsible. He said an uncontrolled protest could not be permitted in Islamabad as there were many sensitive offices and embassies.

“How will you handle if some miscreants enter the capital under the guise of protesters?” he asked. The chief justice remarked that the court had given an order during the 2014 sit-in, but after that the PTV and Parliament’s buildings were attacked.

Barrister Ali Zafar said they had approached the court with the request to stop the arrests of his party’s workers. The PTI had given an application to the district magistrate for permission to hold a rally on May 25. The court adjourned the case till May 27.",Q2

According to Adm. Mike Gilday

, the chief of naval operations (CNO, Navy's senior officer) the answer is yes -- at least when it comes to the U.S. Navy fighting its share of the war.

Advertisement

According to Stars and Stripes, during a May 12 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo, asked Gilday: ""What would the impact be on the Navy's ability to meet its operational requirements in (Europe) if we had to withhold Navy forces from Europe in order to deter Chinese aggression in (the Pacific)?""

Gilday replied that the current fleet of about 298 ships ""is not sized to handle two simultaneous conflicts."" The Navy is ""sized to fight one and keep a second adversary in check, but in terms of two all-out conflicts, we are not sized for that.""

Given the genuine threat posed by communist China -- whose navy is already larger than the U.S. Navy -- this is a jaw-dropping statement for the Navy's senior officer to say on the record.

Consider the information and narrative warfare elements -- and the Biden administration emphasizes ""perception"" above all. At the definite minimum Gilday's assessments rates as a diplomatic perception faux pas -- it signals weakness. At the hyperbolic maximum -- admittedly extreme -- Beijing's imperialist dictatorship could read it as an invitation to attack Taiwan. Given Russia's invasion of Ukraine, never dismiss hyperbolic and idiotic aggression by a dictatorship as impossible.

Major caveat: Ukraine's ferocious resistance to Russia's aggression should give Beijing aggressors second and third thoughts.

Alas -- Gilday exposes an unfortunate vulnerability. My American political explanation: He wants more money for the Navy and its current acquisition programs.

Another reason? Everyone sentient on the Senate Armed Services Committee knows the U.S. military is structured to ""fight one and hold one.""

The first ""one"" means a must-win war.

In this strategic bind we bet we win the one we choose to fight first then we go and win the one we held -- or hope we held.

""Win, hold, win"" -- a bumper sticker that's the organizing principle.

In July 2001 then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, through a Pentagon leak, indicated America would no longer field -- and pay for -- a military built to fight a ""two war strategy.""

In the late 1990s a bipartisan Washington consensus believed the U.S. no longer confronted the strategic threat of fighting simultaneous major wars in the Atlantic/Europe and in the Pacific/Asia.

In a column written in July 2001 I suggested Rumsfeld was telling America that World War II and its Cold War aftermath had finally come to a strategic endpoint. The Cold War was World War II's long goodbye, with U.S. and Russian troops facing each other in a divided Germany. America's direct involvement in Asian tumults like the Korean and Vietnam wars were the fallout of defeating Japan -- and then confronting communist China and the USSR.

To be fair to Rumsfeld's 2001 (but pre-9/11) context, he was addressing a late 1990s' Pentagon planning concept for waging ""two major regional wars.""

Rumsfeld wanted to align Pentagon strategy with budget if not strategic threat. Since 1993 Congress had been spending the so-called end of the Cold War ""peace dividend.""

As for reality? In 1993 Russia was kaput. In 1993 it appeared China wanted to make money.In 2022 China is ""the pacing threat."" That's Pentagonese for America's most potent enemy. In his pre-testimony written remarks, Gilday employed the slang to make his point: ""Sea control and power projection are essential to U.S. national security and long-term economic health."" China, ""our pacing threat, clearly recognizes this...""

In 2018, Congress stipulated the Navy deploy a 355-ship fleet ""as soon as practicable,"" but the fleet has been reduced due to budget requirements. China's fleet already has 355 ships.

Smucker, most Republicans dissenting","U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker on Friday joined nearly every Republican member of the House to vote against a gun safety bill that was passed by the U.S. Senate a day prior – legislation negotiated by senators after the May 24 mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

Explaining his vote, Smucker, a Republican representing Lancaster County, cited “deep concerns” that the legislation “would infringe upon the constitutional rights of hundreds of thousands of law-abiding gun owners” within his district. Instead, Smucker said he's in favor of funding increased school safety and mental health resources.

“I believe we ought to work to keep firearms out of the hands of those who would do harm to themselves or others, however, I swore and oath to support and defend the Constitution, and this legislation would infringe on an individual’s rights,” he said in a written statement. “I will continue to protect the Second Amendment rights of my constituents.”

Smucker has long accepted money from gun rights advocates.

The bill, called the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, passed in the House in a 234-193 vote, with 14 Republicans giving support. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, of Bucks County, was the lone Pennsylvania House Republican to vote in favor of its passage.

The bill passed the Senate Thursday in a 65-33 vote, and President Joe Biden is expected to sign it into law.

The bill would require more thorough background checks on firearms purchases aged 18 to 20. It also would restrict convicted domestic abusers’ ability to purchase firearms. That’s in addition to funding mental health programs and providing assistance to states and local government to implement so-called Red Flag laws, which allow police to temporarily confiscate firearms from gun owners who a court decides are a danger to themselves or others.

Smucker has consistently made clear his support of gun ownership throughout his time as a politician while noting a need for more background checks to stop guns from getting into the wrong hands.

Smucker, then serving in the state Senate, said in December 2012 that he supported calls for action by Congress on gun restrictions after the Sandy Hook school massacre.

“Any legislation must be well-thought-out and uphold our constitutional right to bear arms,” he said at the time.

After he was elected to Congress in 2016, Smucker expressed belief that certain individuals, notably criminals and children, shouldn’t be able to get ahold of guns. In 2018, he said anyone “seeking to harm themselves or others shouldn’t have access to firearms.”

Also in 2018, Smucker again expressed support for strengthening existing background requirements along with outlawing bump stocks, which were banned nationwide in 2019. The man who killed 60 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas in October 2017 equipped some of his firearms with bump stocks, which enable machine-gun-like rapid firing.

Since 2016, Smucker has taken $10,950 directly from the National Rifle Association, and he has benefited from an additional $226,342 in independent support from the NRA, according to records posted by OpenSecrets.org. Of the 535 members of Congress, Smucker ranks 30th in most money taken from the NRA, those records show.

Gun Owners of America

Numerous firearms retailers at gun shops across Lancaster County either were unavailable or unwilling to discuss the bill Friday morning.

Val Finnell, state director of Pennsylvania’s branch of Gun Owners of America, said his group’s members “don’t support anything in the bill.” He noted concerns about the proposal to lengthen background check wait times for firearms purchasers under the age of 21.

“It’s a constitutional right, and a right delayed is a right denied,” Finnell said before describing what he sees as hypocrisy — allowing 18-year-olds to enlist and wield firearms in the military, while imposing a different standard on civilian gun ownership rights.

New rules governing domestic abusers' access to firearms — the bill would prohibit access in some cases — also was a point of contention.

“It’s a backdoor method of gun control,” Finnell said. “Rather than banning guns, they just keep expanding the number of people who aren’t allowed to own them.”

That’s all in addition to vehement disapproval of any expansion of Red Flag laws.

None of that, he said, will prevent a legal gun owner from carrying out a mass shooting if they choose to do so.

“It’s happened here in this county,” Finnell said, noting that the firearms used in the mass shootings last month in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, were purchased legally.

Casey and Toomey

Less than a day before the House vote, the bill won the support of Pennsylvania’s two senators, Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. and Republican Pat Toomey.

On Thursday, Casey called it “the most significant legislation to begin to tackle gun violence in nearly three decades.”

“Americans deserve to feel safe in their schools, grocery stores, synagogues, churches and communities. Getting this bill to the President’s desk and signed into law will save lives,” Casey said in a statement.

Toomey similarly lauded the bill for its potential to increase safety, especially when it comes to decreasing access to firearms among both criminals and “dangerously mentally ill” people.

However, Toomey, in a Thursday news release, was careful not to refer to the bill as a gun control measure.

“The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act isn’t a gun control bill — it’s commonsense legislation to strengthen background checks, provide federal assistance for state crisis intervention programs, enhance penalties for gun trafficking and straw purchases, and invest in school safety and mental health,” he said.",Q2
https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/the-grove-is-no-longer-st-louis-gayborhood-37916200,The Grove Is No Longer St. Louis' Gayborhood,"click to enlarge VICTOR STEFANESCU The Grove neighborhood in St. Louis has lost a lot of the bars and population that made it a gayborhood.

Ania Cunningham learned about the Grove a little bit earlier than she should have.

""This might sound bad, but I used to run down here and underage drink during GroveFest,"" she says.

Cunningham, now 31, has worked in the Grove, a stretch of Manchester Avenue between Kingshighway and Vandeventer in the Forest Park Southeast neighborhood, since she was 20.

In the past, when Cunningham got off of work at 1:30 a.m., she would bar-hop down the strip.

""I would pop out and pop everywhere,"" she says.

But she doesn't do that so much anymore.

It's a cool Wednesday afternoon in May, and Cunningham is slinging drinks behind the bar at Layla, a burger and shawarma joint in the heart of the Grove.

A bartender in drag makeup serves a guy in a Blues jersey, and an expansive rainbow flag is stretched across the street-facing window. The kitchen is closed for the day, but customers can wander to a food truck right outside the restaurant. It looks like a microcosm of the neighborhood, or of what it once was.

Cunningham has noticed changes in the Grove.

""I feel like this was the gayborhood,"" Cunningham says. ""And not to say that it's not — but it's just, it's not feeling like that anymore as much as it did when I was younger.""

Fewer gay bars line the strip than in the Grove's heyday. Housing prices are increasing more rapidly here than in the city as a whole. And the neighborhood is less diverse than it was 10 years ago.

It's not just the Grove: Gayborhoods across the country are changing. Supporters of the Castro in San Francisco say LGBTQ individuals are leaving the neighborhood while straight families are moving in. In Chicago, one scholar says the future of Northalsted, formerly known as Boystown, is uncertain.

But Amin Ghaziani, a professor of sociology at the University of British Columbia who has written about trends in American gayborhoods, tells the Riverfront Times that referring to neighborhoods like the Grove as ""declining,"" ""disappearing"" or ""dying"" might be a mistake.

""Instead, I prefer to think that their significance is changing,'' he says. ""And it makes sense for us to ask why.""

To Ghaziani, gayborhoods are not important for any one particular reason.

""I think the reason why gayborhoods are important is that they don't offer any singular or static thing,"" he says. ""The offerings of a gay district evolve as the circumstances in which we live and find ourselves evolve.""

The neighborhoods started forming after World War II, according to Ghaziani, allowing LGBTQ people the opportunity to congregate and build communities. But by the late 1960s with the arrival of New Left activism — a progressive political movement to achieve things like gay rights — the offerings of gayborhoods had evolved.

""They provided crucibles for the cultivation of political protest and political consciousness,"" he says.

After the 1970s, the neighborhoods continued on a political trajectory, hosting voting drives and cultural celebrations like Pride parades, according to Ghaziani.

Steven Louis Brawley likes to think of the neighborhoods as places where LGBTQ people can live, work and play.

Since 2007, Brawley has recorded queer and trans history in St. Louis through the St. Louis LGBT History Project. He started the project as an effort to document an oral history that was starting to disappear.

""I came out in '87, I guess, into the gay-bar scene in St. Louis, and I would meet these people, and they would tell me these great stories that I would be fascinated by,"" he says. ""But sadly, over time, folks started passing away, and I realized that nobody was reporting these stories.""

The project paints a comprehensive picture of the city's LGBTQ history from the 1950s onward. It includes stories from the city's various gayborhoods.

Throughout St. Louis' history, other neighborhoods — not just the Grove — served as gay villages. Ghaziani says there's often more than just one pocket of a city where LGBTQ people gather.

""It doesn't make sense anymore to think about 'the gayborhood' as a singular thing,"" he says. ""I think instead we're moving toward a model of 'gayborhoods, plural.'""

In St. Louis, LGBTQ people found those pockets in neighborhoods like Soulard and Lafayette Square. In the 1960s, Brawley says the Central West End emerged as one of those places where community members could do all three: live, work and play.

""It wasn't just [that you] went there to party, but you had shops there, you worked there,"" he says. ""You live[d] in the neighborhood.""

In the 1990s, a few gay bars started to pop up in the Grove.

""These bars weren't your trendy A-list bars,"" Brawley says.

But as Washington University started investing in the area near its medical campus in the 1990s, the Grove benefited. The rehabilitation of Forest Park Southeast brought new apartment buildings to the neighborhood and more customers to the bars.

""Basically Novak's Bar was booming, and Attitudes was booming, and Rainbow's End and Freddie's, they were booming,"" Brawley says. ""They were very profitable bars.""

In 2006, Serge Patel discovered the Grove and its nightlife after moving to St. Louis from Canada. At bars like Novak's and Just John's, he says he met all kinds of people.

""This was one of the neighborhoods I liked, because it was inviting and accepting,"" he says. ""Compared to other parts of the city, I just felt more inclusive and safe here.""

But the bars Brawley mentioned as thriving in the 1990s are now closed. Longtime gay bar Attitudes closed during the COVID-19 pandemic after 32 years of business, and the pink paint that wraps around the seemingly vacant building's exterior is starting to fade away. Novak's closed in 2013 after its controversial owner and St. Louis LGBTQ pioneer Nancy Novak retired.

""We only have, what, three bars now,"" Brawley says.

Just John's and Rehab still stand strong on the strip. A new LGBTQ bar, Prism, takes the spot of the Monocle, a gay bar that closed in 2020.

But, for many, the bars feel different than they did in the 1990s and 2000s.

In 2010, Patel started to notice a greater mix of people bar-hopping in the Grove. He says there was an influx of Saint Louis University and Wash U students — among others — at the bars, and the energy in the neighborhood shifted.

""You go in any of these bars, anytime, and you see a mixed blend of people, either gay folks with their friends or straight allies,"" Brawley says. Another resident, Tommy Espenschied, grew up in Brentwood and just moved to the neighborhood in the past few months. His gay brother introduced him to the neighborhood and bars like Just John's during his late teens. But today, he says he doesn't often think about the Grove as an LGBTQ community.

""Growing up, I did always know it was a gayborhood,"" he says. ""Like I definitely know that identity of the neighbor of course, and I embrace that part of the identity.""

Ghaziani says there are many reasons gayborhoods are changing, but three most often get talked about: gentrification, changing attitudes toward LGBTQ people and technology.

In cities across the country, rapidly increasing real-estate values in gayborhoods are pushing out LGBTQ folks.

In Forest Park Southeast, the median sale price jumped by nearly 190 percent in the last five years, from $169,500 in April 2017, to $490,500 in April of this year, according to Redfin data. In the same period, the median sale price in St. Louis city only increased by 39.3 percent.

As a result, the neighborhood is becoming increasingly homogenous. According to census data from St. Louis city, white people made up 46.2 percent of Forest Park Southeast's population in 2020, compared to 30.1 percent in 2010, and just 18.4 percent in 2000. In the same 20-year period, the Black population in the neighborhood shrunk by 53.8 percent.

The same thing happened in other areas of the city, Brawley says. LGBTQ people were essential to rehabilitation efforts in the Central West End. In Lafayette Square, he says they helped restore the Victorian townhouses which adorn the neighborhood. But after reviving the neighborhoods, gentrification priced many LGBTQ folks out of the areas, he says.

Cunningham isn't seeing some of the people she used to run into.

""I feel like the people that built it up to begin with, or that were here even five years ago, aren't here anymore because they can't afford to be,"" she says.

Improving attitudes toward queer people have also changed the fabric of gayborhoods, according to Ghaziani.

Unfortunately, attitudes toward transgender people are changing for the worse: According to Gallup, 5 percent fewer people in the U.S. supported transgender people serving in the military in 2021 compared to 2019. But Gallup also reports that 70 percent of people in the U.S. support same-sex marriage in 2021, compared to just 27 percent in 1996.

The shift has resulted in straight people becoming more comfortable living in gayborhoods and LGBTQ people feeling safer living in other parts of the city.

Brawley says he lived in the Central West End for 15 years and loved it. Now, though, he lives in Kirkwood.

""As I got older, I just needed a different change of pace,"" he says.

Ghaziani says the arrival of new social networks like Grindr has allowed LGBTQ people to connect with others outside of physical spaces like gay bars centered in gayborhoods. Grindr is a geosocial dating app for gay, bi, trans and queer people that allows users to connect with others nearby.

Brawley says young people tell him that they get burned out on those dating apps and would have liked to experience a neighborhood like the Grove in its heyday. But back then, according to Brawley, queer displays in public could be dangerous. ""You didn't hold hands in the West End or Soulard,"" he says. ""You had to be careful and watch your surroundings. It just was a different time.""

The LGBTQ community feeling less pressure to live in gayborhoods presents an interesting conundrum. ""Is it good for the community to try to find a place where a lot of people can be together?"" Brawley asks. ""Or is it good that we can live anywhere we want and not face as much discrimination? We still face discrimination that's still there.""

Safe neighborhoods may be increasing in importance. In Missouri and elsewhere, new legislative moves threaten trans rights, and in Florida, a new ""Don't Say Gay"" bill constrains instruction on gender and sexuality. No time was the importance of gayborhoods more pronounced than in 2016 after the Pulse nightclub shooting.

""I would say, despite declarations about the changing resonance of gay neighborhoods, a fantastic contemporary example which points to their staying power and resonance is the fact that shortly after the shootings at the Pulse nightclub in Florida, a lot of people congregated in gay neighborhoods across the country to hold candlelight vigils,"" Ghaziani says.

That happened in the Grove, too.

Brawley says St. Louis' gayborhoods of the future are bound to look different.

""I just think the days of the old gayborhoods may be gone forever, in terms of what they used to be,"" he says. ""And that's OK."" Community, after all, can be made anywhere.",Q2
https://www.kzyx.org/npr-news/2022-04-23/for-the-first-time-in-4-years-a-litter-of-red-wolf-pups-was-born-in-the-wild,"For the first time in 4 years, a litter of red wolf pups was born in the wild","U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff in North Carolina welcomed a litter of six red wolf pups into the world earlier this week. It's the first time in four years that a pair of wild red wolves — a species teetering on the brink of extinction — gave birth to a litter in the wild.

The newborn pups, four females and two males, were found in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge along the coast of northeastern North Carolina. Staff at the Red Wolf Recovery Program announced the paw-sitive news on Facebook Thursday.

""This new litter is the first wild-born litter of red wolves since 2018. This red wolf pair was formed through the combination of several management actions and the two red wolves subsequently following their natural instincts in pairing, establishing their territory and mating,"" the post read. ""Every generation yields a new born hope for the red wolf...a cause for joy and celebration!""

Before settlers arrived in North America, red wolves thrived throughout the Southeast U.S, from Florida to the Great Plains and the Ohio River Valley, according to national conservation organization Defenders of Wildlife. But through hunting, extermination and the expansion of cities and towns, humans drove the species to near extinction.

There were a mere 17 wolves left to save when the Endangered Species Act passed in 1973. Before 14 of the remaining 17 wolves were trapped and transferred into captivity, the handful of survivors lived across a small area of the Louisiana and Texas coast.

The remaining wolves disappeared, Fish and Wildlife said, attributed to continued human persecution and a loss of habitat. The red wolf was declared extinct in the wild in 1980.

Just four years later, there were 63 healthy red wolves in captivity, which were being prepared to release into the wild with hopes of giving the species a second chance. As part of the Red Wolf Species Survival Plan, the Red Wolf Recovery Program said, more than 60 adult wolves were released into the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge between 1987 and 1994.

In the following years, the wolves did what came naturally: They maintained territories, formed packs and more importantly, began to breed.

/ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service An adult red wolf pictured in October 2013 in North Carolina. The population peaked in 2012 at 120 wild wolves, but has dwindled over the past decade.

As other environmentalists marveled at the success of the Red Wolf Recovery Program, it became a model for reintroduction efforts of gray wolves, Mexican wolves, California condors and the black-footed ferret.

In 2012, the population reached a peak of 120. According to the FWS, this was the first time a large carnivore was brought back from extinction and reintroduced to the wild in the U.S.

But once again, humans threatened the handful of the surviving wolves.

Conservationists came to the wolves' aid once again in 2012, after one red wolf after another was shot and killed, having been mistaken for a coyote, according to a Southern Environmental Law Center news release. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission had recently approved a temporary rule allowing hunters to kill coyotes, which occasionally breed with the wolves, at night in the area where red wolf was trying to make a comeback.

The population had dropped to 100 by the time a settlement was reached between environmentalists and the NCWRC. Spotlight hunting at night was outlawed and hunters were required to carry a permit for coyote hunting during daylight hours.

/ Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge / Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge The population of red wolves have been on the decline since 2012, when they were sometimes mistaken for coyotes and shot and killed as a result.

But the number of wolves continued to dwindle, reaching a concerning low population estimate of 17-20 in 2020 and 2021. There has been a steady decline in red wolves born in the wild from 2008, which saw 47 new wolves, to only four pups in 2018. Fish and Wildlife didn't report a single red wolf birth in the wild in 2019, 2020 or 2021.

Which is why the recent litter of six is such exciting news to conservationists and wolf enthusiasts alike. As of today, there are an estimated 15 to 17 red wolves living in the wild. Another 241 exist in captivity. They continue to be one of the most endangered animals on the planet.

ST. ANTHONY, Idaho — An Idaho judge has ruled that the jury trial for Lori Vallow Daybell will be delayed, meaning she will be tried in conjunction with her husband, Chad Daybell, both of whom face numerous murder charges.

Fremont County Judge Steven Boyce issued a written decision Thursday to approve Lori Daybell's trial delay. Her attorneys opted to not waive her right to a speedy trial, which would force the prosecution to try her case within six months of her arraignment.

Daybell was scheduled to face a jury in October, but prosecutors filed a motion earlier this month to delay her trial, which was scheduled to last 10 weeks.

During a hearing last week, prosecutors argued that the large amount of evidence and complexity of the case warranted additional time to prepare. Lori Daybell's attorneys also noted they were still trying to get caught up in the case, as her previous attorney was removed from the case in December.

Court records filed in May indicate her attorneys have also cited her ""extremely complex and fragile"" mental health. Daybell was restored to competency and declared fit for trial in April, and her case has been on hold since June 2021, when a judge ruled she was not competent.

Lori and Chad Daybell face numerous felonies, including murder, after the deaths of her children, Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 16. The children's bodies were found on Chad Daybell's property in Salem, Idaho. The two are also accused of murder in connection with the 2019 death of Chad Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell. Both have pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Boyce's written order cites the fact that both Daybells are facing potential death sentences as just one reason for Lori Daybell's trial delay. The order also notes that a prior ruling states the two must be tried together, and the October trial would go against that.

""The discovery volume is extraordinary,"" Boyce wrote. ""(Lori Daybell's) defense team has only recently been fully assembled and has expressed concerns with the ability to be fully prepared to defend their client in October. The trial itself has been set for duration of 10 weeks — which further confirms that scope of evidence the state intends to introduce.""

With Boyce's ruling, both Daybells are set to begin a jury trial at the Ada County Courthouse in Boise on Jan. 9, 2023. As of Thursday, Lori Daybell's next hearing is scheduled for a pretrial conference in November.",Q2

https://www.kyuk.org/science-and-environment/2022-06-24/a-federal-court-temporarily-suspends-adf-g-from-announcing-conflicting-openers-on-the-kuskokwim,A federal court temporarily suspends ADF&G from announcing conflicting openers on the Kuskokwim,"A federal court ruled that the State of Alaska cannot issue gillnet openers for all Alaskans in the federal areas of the Kuskokwim River, at least for now. That will be the job of the federal government. A local Tribal group requested the order favoring federal management following disagreements between state and federal managers. The court order follows years of low Chinook and chum salmon runs on the Kuskokwim River and in the broader region.

A U.S. District court ruled June 23 to temporarily bar the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) from announcing conflicting salmon openers on the Kuskokwim River’s federal waters. The state’s openers allow all Alaskans to fish the Kuskokwim, but the feds only allow fishing by qualified subsistence users. The Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission requested the order against ADF&G. The fish commission said that the state’s openers violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, or ANILCA.

ANILCA gives preference to rural subsistence users to fish, and fishing has been difficult for subsistence users. That's because Chinook numbers on the river have been on a downward trend for years, and chum numbers are starting to crash too. Kwethluk-born, Bethel-based Harry Alexie said that the absence of fish is deeply felt.

“I grew up with abundance of fish. If we did one set, we filled up a boat in my younger years. And that's not common today. I'm feeling for my two kids, for their generation in which they were not able to experience what we experienced,” said Alexie.

Alexie said that he likes the federal government’s conservation-based approach. He also likes that the feds co-manage the river with Tribes, whereas the state does not.

“In my opinion, the state should be consulting with Tribes also. Get the numbers and expertise from the people who are living on the land,” said Alexie.

The temporary order against ADF&G is part of an ongoing lawsuit the federal government filed against the state of Alaska over the same issue. The order will expire when the lawsuit is resolved. The lawsuit and temporary order are the result of a conflict that heated up when the state announced openings against the wishes of the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission in 2021.

At first, the state only announced openings on the same days that the feds announced openings. The only difference between the openers was that the state allowed all Alaskans to fish. The conflict came to a head in 2021 when the state announced an opening on a day that the feds had closed the river. The Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission said in its oral arguments that it created confusion on the river. And the court agreed in issuing its decision. The judge who wrote the decision quoted the fish commission’s oral arguments, saying that it doesn’t matter how many fish are harvested by non-federally qualified users.

“You can’t give a fish back to the federally qualified user that was taken by a non-federally qualified user. We’re not going to somehow be able to compensate the members of the federally recognized Tribes along this portion of the Kuskokwim River,” said attorneys for the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.

Attorneys representing ADF&G argue that opening the river to all Alaskans allows people who have moved away from the region to come back and fish. And Warren Nicholai from Napaskiak agrees that should be allowed.

“Most of those folks that are wanting to come in are those types of people that wants to better holding on to their ancestral practice,” said Nicholai.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said that they would not comment on pending litigation. The defendants did not respond to comments by deadline.

CLEVELAND — An event in Cleveland that was supposed to be hosted by Ohio State University President Kristina Johnson on Tuesday went on without her. Outside, a group of men who were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of OSU's late team doctor Richard Strauss were protesting for change.

Guests entered Windows on the River dressed up in their scarlet and gray finest, each having paid for ""A Special Gathering With Ohio State's President."" But according to OSU public relations, Johnson had a last minute conflict.

Outside of the event in the Flats, men held signs. Each with a story tying back to abuse at the hands of Dr. Richard Strauss. Few entering the event made eye contact.

""I understand people came for dinner and they didn't expect to be confronted with this, but the message is that important,"" said former OSU wrestler and Strauss victim Tom Lisy.

That message? Listen to our stories.

A former wrestler, a former gymnast and a former student all with tales of abuse at the hands of Dr. Richard Strauss while he worked at Ohio State. All not satisfied with how the university has treated their claims, or that the statute of limitations limits their legal options.

""Your whole sense of who you are, your masculinity just gets ripped out of you. And he has this control over you which I don't think a while lot of people understand,"" former OSU gymnast and Strauss victim Gary Avis added.

An Ohio State spokesperson told 3News that Johnson had a last minute scheduling conflict, and emailed us a statement saying in part, ""We offer our deepest regrets and apologies to all who experienced Strauss' abuse."" OSU says that there are 232 survivors who have settled with the university, receiving a total of $57.8 million.

That settlement is something that the victims who were protesting on Tuesday say came at much too high a price.

""Once you're in the agreement, you can't get out of it. Once you're in the agreement, if they told you you're getting zero for your damages, you could never talk about it, you could never tell another soul. You couldn't talk about it, you couldn't talk badly about it from 2018 on,"" said group organizer and Strauss assault survivor Steve Snyder-Hill.

You can read Ohio State's full statement to 3News below:

""Beginning in 2018, Ohio State sought to uncover and acknowledge the truth about Richard Strauss’ abuse and the university’s failure at the time to prevent it. We offer our deepest regrets and apologies to all who experienced Strauss’ abuse.

Ohio State has reached settlement agreements totaling $57.8 million with 232 survivors. Many survivors who have not yet settled had the opportunity to settle both during mediation and through the individual settlement program and chose not to.

Strauss was a university employed physician from 1978 to 1998. He died in 2005. Ohio State is a fundamentally different university today and over the past 20 years, has committed substantial resources to prevent and address sexual misconduct. These actions include new policies and programs, mandatory training, centralized reporting, additional staffing, and resources throughout the university, including in athletics and the medical center.

Maren Chaloupka and co-counsel Jeff Patterson represented six defendants commonly known as the “Beatrice 6”: Joseph White, Thomas Winslow, Ada JoAnn Taylor, Debra Shelden, James Dean and Kathy Gonzalez. The six people were initially convicted in the 1985 rape and murder of 68-year-old Helen Wilson in Beatrice. In 2008, DNA evidence implicated Bruce Allen Smith, an original suspect in the murder who died in 1992. White was exonerated in court and the other five defendants were pardoned.

Together, the three men and three women spent a combined 75 years in prison in Wilson’s death. With the representation of Patterson, Chaloupka and three other attorneys on the legal team, the six defendants sued Gage County, winning a federal jury trial in 2016. It was the culmination of two decades of Joseph White fighting to prove his innocence.

Chaloupka, and her client, Debra Shelden, are among those interviewed as part of the miniseries, “Mind over Murder,” that documents the case. It’s a case that is well-known to most Nebraskans, if not for the chilling tale of wrongful conviction but also for the $28 million judgment that all Nebraskans are helping pay. The Nebraska Legislature approved a bill helping bail out Gage County, allowing appropriations of $5 million a year to help satisfy the judgment.

Though films, docuseries and televisions in the “true crime” genre have continued to increase in popularity through the years, Patterson, Chaloupka and the defendants in the case have been reluctant to be involved in such projects until being approached by director Nanfu Wang. Wang produced the HBO Original six-part documentary series, “Mind over Murder.”

“After the verdict (in 2016), we started getting approached by different kinds of journalists, both print and documentarians who wanted to make film or TV productions about it. We said no to almost all of them,” Chaloupka said.

She explained that the case is very complex, with the federal trial taking more than a month to present and more than 400 documents among the exhibits.

She said that the attorneys were very protective of their clients, and not interested in ventures that would exploit their stories for commercialism. They wanted to maintain the integrity of the truth.

“The reason our clients spent a combined 77 years in prison was because people were not interested in the truth,” she said. “And because they were not interested in the truth, our clients suffered terribly. They’re never going to recover from that damage.”

In working with a journalist from The New Yorker, they became associated with Wang.

“She asked us to look at some of the other work she had done. She referred us to some of her other films. ... She is a MacArthur Genius Grant recipient. She is an Oscar-nominated director. And when we watched some of her other films, we were impressed that she had the emotional capacity to carry a complicated, factually and emotionally accurate story.”

As she also tells their story, Chaloupka notes that the defendants in the case don’t like being called the Beatrice 6, though she acknowledges that the moniker is an easy way for the media and others to refer to the six people in the case.

“It (the Beatrice 6 moniker) is a lot easier than explaining, you know, three men and three women who were wrongfully convicted. It’s easy to remember and explain it ... but these weren’t a group of people who hung around or ran around together before this happened. Some of them didn’t even really know each other.

“...So they have this label define them at a time when they’re trying to move forward, and one of them isn’t even living anymore. It has been hard for them. The whole experience has been awful,” she said.

For more than a decade, Chaloupka has been a part of the case in representing Shelden, and in an initial trailer for the docuseries, it’s evident that Shelden still struggles with the aftermath of the case. Some of the most emotional pieces of the trailer come from Shelden.

For her client, Chaloupka said, issues in the case revolved around the intentional influencing the woman to solve the case. The federal jury concluded that Gage County deputy Burt Searcey, who led the cold-case investigation, and Deputy Wage Price, who also worked as a psychologist, had manufactured evidence or engaged in a reckless investigation that violated the rights of the six defendants.

In just one example of the emotional upheaval, Chaloupka shared how Price, who claimed to be treating the defendants during the investigation to recover memories, told Shelden – a woman with an IQ in the 70s that made her susceptible to suggestion and also suffering from schizoaffective disorder – to go back to her jail cell and “‘the truth’ would come to her in a dream.”

And, Shelden did, suffering a nightmare, subsequently convinced that she and another woman had been at the scene of the crime. Deputies based her recounting of the dream as its cause for arresting Kathy Gonzalez in the case. Statements or “therapy” provided by Price is reported to be tied to more than one false confession made in the case.

Each of the defendants had very unique experiences, Chaloupka said, as a result of egregious law enforcement and prosecutorial misconduct.

“Imagine, you or me being prosecuted for murder because someone had a dream that you were there,” she said, saying “You can’t make this s— up.”

Without the persistence of White, who maintained his innocence, the six defendants may never have been cleared and some would still be in prison. In fact, some of the defendants, including Shelden, served out their sentences in the case before being cleared.

Attorneys battled for their clients during two civil trials and four appeals, Chaloupka said.

Wang doesn’t just take the audience through the stories of the Beatrice 6, but also the Wilson family and the Beatrice community. She doesn’t shy away from the fact that many of the family members continue to believe that the six cleared defendants are guilty or that some in the Beatrice community would rather not discuss the case, ever. Former Attorney General Jon Bruning has said in interviews that he has been surprised at the anger among those who insist that the Beatrice 6 are guilty, despite the evidence.

Family members of Wilson also live in the Scottsbluff area and were among the children and grandchildren Wang interviewed, which Chaloupka credited as part of the journalistic process that made her supportive and confident in Wang’s ability to tell the story. The long-lasting effects of the case are felt on both sides, she said. She told the Star-Herald she can understand the Wilson family’s grief, particularly in experiencing the shock and grief of having mother and grandmother taken in such a horrific way, the need for closure as the case remained unsolved, and then the rollercoaster of events as they believed in deputies they thought to be heroes for solving the case.

“What they have been through is shocking and confusing, and the real killer was never brought to justice,” she said. “He died without answering for his crime. ... I just am so sad for what they’ve been through.”

Like the audience, Chaloupka will be seeing the docuseries for the first time when it premieres Monday. Patterson planned to “binge” the docuseries, but Chaloupka said she will watch it as episodes are released.

However, despite not having watched it, she said, she is confident in the production. Wang did exhaustive research during the project, including interviews with law enforcement and travels throughout the U.S. In being able to observe some of the interviews, such as with Shelden, Chaloupka said she has been impressed with Wang’s interview style and abilities.",Q2

Wade,"The Supreme Court released the decision about Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The case serves as a way for opponents to get rid of the federal protections for access to abortion, as established in Roe v. Wade.

A preliminary injunction has been issued by the Michigan Court of Claims for the 1931 law that banned abortions without exception for cases of rape and incest. While the federal right to an abortion is now gone, the injunction makes it legal — for now — to get an abortion in the state.

The 6-3 decision by the Court has elicited several reactions among opponents and supporters of abortion and reproductive rights.

Dr. Lisa Harris, an abortion-provider in Michigan, said that she and her colleagues have been thinking about how the Dobbs decision will impact the care for their patients. She said she already received an email from an out-of-state colleague who needs to now find care for a pregnant patient elsewhere.

“For those of us on the ground providing clinical work...this is a care and caregiving issue,” Harris said. “We’re not thinking about it in terms of political gains or losses.”

Harris also notes that abortion has been very common, including in the time period when the Constitution was written. She said that people have always ended pregnancies and that it used to not be as stigmatized or contested.

“You could look in women’s diaries at the time and read about the measures they took to end a pregnancy, you could see ads in newspapers for medications to end pregnancies,” she said. “That would be a tradition. I would say not so much a tradition of abortion, but a tradition of women in the context of their lives and their families, knowing what the best thing for them was and acting accordingly.”

As for her reaction to the ruling, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan Genevieve Marnon, said she was ecstatic. She called the federal protections for abortion the “main obstacle” in the way for “restoring the legal protection for the unborn child.”

Marnon said that the opponents of abortion-rights are fighting on three fronts. First, they want to defeat the lawsuits from both Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the one filed by Planned Parenthood of Michigan, the latter of which brought about the injunction. The second is that they want to defeat the ballot initiative that abortion-right advocates have been gathering signatures for that would enshrine abortion protections into the state constitution. The final goal is to maintain control of at least one chamber of the legislature.

“So we really have a three tiered fight going on and any one of them is not more important than the other,” Marnon said. “So we have our work cut out for us.”

That's exactly what a professional Youtuber and angler, Payton Moore did after snagging one of the largest unofficially recorded alligator gars ever captured in North America.

YouTube YouTube loading...

Payton who resides in Sugarland, Texas was fishing in a Houston area bayou when his 80-pound test line got tested after wrestling with the humongous garfish who was not willing to be reeled in. Eventually, the monster fish was corraled in by using a rope to wrap around one of its fins.

Massive Fish

The 32-year-old Moore would not say the name of the bayou in order to protect the fish after releasing it back into the water. The fish weighed well over 300 pounds and was 8 feet, 2 inches long and its girth was 48 inches.

YouTube YouTube loading...

Moore feels that the fish might have been big enough to break a state record but it has to be weighed on a state-certified scale in order to be officially certified.

Dr. Solomon David, an aquatic ecologist at Nichols State University says the fish could have been between 50 to 100 years old, according to the Houston Chronicle. It's estimated that alligator gar can live well over 100 years.

The largest alligator gar on record in the world is 8 feet 5 inches and weighed 327 pounds. Moore's fish was pretty close to breaking that record but one thing's for sure, Payton has one hell of a fishing story to tell and proof on video that it was just not another fisherman's wise tale.

Internet Explorer is dead. Microsoft is retiring IE today after nearly 27 years. The aging web browser is being sunset in favor of Microsoft Edge, with support being officially withdrawn for IE 11 today. It’s the end of an internet era, after Microsoft initially moved away from the Internet Explorer branding with the release of Windows 10 in 2015.

For consumers, not much changes. Usage of Internet Explorer has plummeted in recent years, with StatCounter showing IE has less than half a percent of overall browser market share. Microsoft has been trying to stop people from using Internet Explorer for years now, and the company previously labeled it a “compatibility solution” rather than a browser that businesses should actively be using.

Farewell, Internet Explorer.

Microsoft will start rolling out a new prompt over the coming months that redirect those still using Internet Explorer over to Microsoft Edge. Eventually, Internet Explorer will be permanently disabled as part of a future Windows update. You can read more about how Microsoft is handling the removal of Internet Explorer in Windows right here.

While Microsoft has moved to its Chromium-powered Edge as the default browser on Windows 11, the MSHTML engine that powers Internet Explorer is still part of Windows 11. It exists purely for IE mode in Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft says it will support IE mode in Edge through at least 2029.

Businesses have largely moved to Edge’s IE mode for web apps and sites that are so old they still require Internet Explorer. Microsoft created this IE mode for Edge in 2019, and it supports older ActiveX controls that many legacy sites still use. Spiritually, Internet Explorer will live on through this mode, but there won’t be Internet Explorer cakes anymore.

A new redirect for Internet Explorer users. Image: Microsoft

Some businesses will still be caught by surprise by the retirement of Internet Explorer, or won’t have been able to fully remove its use in time. Nikkei reported this week that some government agencies and financial institutions in Japan have been slow to respond to the IE retirement. The website for Japan Pension Service must still be viewed in Edge’s IE mode, for example.

There are likely thousands of similar businesses and instances of Internet Explorer usage worldwide, too. Microsoft has been warning about today’s Internet Explorer retirement for years, and it’s still treading carefully with prompts and redirects until the browser is fully removed in the coming months.

Windows 11 users won’t have to worry about Internet Explorer, as it doesn’t even ship with an accessible version of IE. It’s the first time Microsoft hasn’t bundled IE with a new version of Windows for more than 20 years. That bundling decision led to the infamous United States v. Microsoft antitrust battle and the European Commission’s action against Microsoft that resulted in a browser ballot inside certain versions of Windows.",Q2

The first point in the agenda of Duarte’s trial is an apparent illicit transfer of more than 96 million pesos (almost five million dollars) between 2011 and 2015 to companies based in Chihuahua of which he was a shareholder.

Duarte administered Chihuahua from 2010 to 2016, and was later arrested in Miami in July 2020 by the US Federal Marshal Service, with his lawyers processing various appeals all this time seeking to prevent his extradition to Mexico.

https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2022/04/27/monica-conyers-candidate-wayne-county-executive-but-banned-serving/9552328002/,"Monica Conyers a 'candidate' for Wayne County executive, but banned from serving","Detroit — Former Detroit City Council President Monica Conyers set herself up for a comeback on April 19, when she filed to run as a Democrat in the Wayne County executive race.

But she is banned from being elected to office under Michigan law since she pleaded guilty in 2009 to one federal count of conspiracy to commit bribery. Conyers was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison for accepting money in exchange for her vote on a $1 billion sludge-hauling deal.

In the eyes of the law, Conyers became a candidate when she made the filing. Fellow Democrat, Wayne County Executive Warren Evans, is running for re-election.

""This office has recently received an affidavit of identity for the office of Wayne County Executive received on April 19 2022,"" the Wayne County Clerk's office wrote in an April 22 letter to Conyers. ""Therefore, the individual has now become a candidate under the Michigan Campaign Finance Act, and is required to form a campaign committee.""

But Conyers' filing came well within the 20-year ban on election or appointment to public office in Michigan after being ""convicted of a felony involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or a breach of the public trust"" related to that person's public service.

In November 2010, Michigan voters approved the ban by an almost 3-1 margin in amending the state constitution. The ban started in the Michigan Senate as Senate Joint Resolution 5.

Sponsored by then-State Sen. Tupac Hunter, D-Detroit, and passed by two-thirds of the Michigan House and Senate before heading to voters, the resolution was made in response to concerns that former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who had resigned in September 2008, would someday return to office.

Kilpatrick had said as much in his exit address.

""I want to tell you, Detroit, that you done set me up for a comeback,"" Kilpatrick said in his 20-minute televised speech.

Kilpatrick resigned as then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a fellow Democrat, had started removal proceedings.

The Wayne County Clerk's Office is ""not authorized to reject the filing of an Affidavit of identity if the prospective candidate attests that they meet the statutory and constitutional requirements of the office sought,"" said clerk's office spokeswoman Lisa Williams.

""The initial onus is on the person filing to attest to their eligibility,"" Williams added. ""The current candidate list is unofficial, as the filing and withdrawal deadlines recently concluded on April 22.""

Conyers paid a $100 filing fee. Conyers couldn't be immediately reached for comment.

Conyers' filing also started a 10-calendar-day clock to form a candidate committee. Until it is formed, Conyers' registration shows as ""pending"" on the Wayne County campaign finance portal.

April 27 is day eight. After the committee is formed, the candidate has 10 more days to register the committee.

Other Democrats running for county executive are Beverly Kindle-Walker of Detroit and MD R. Alam of Detroit.

https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220617-trump-unleashed-mob-after-vp-rejected-election-plot-probe,Trump unleashed mob after VP rejected election plot: probe,"The House committee probing last year's attack on the US Capitol detailed how the former president berated Mike Pence for not going along with the scheme both knew to be unlawful -- even after being told violence had erupted as Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's victory.

At its third public hearing into the January 6, 2021 insurrection, the panel detailed a ""relentless"" pressure campaign by Trump on Pence -- as cornerstone of a criminal conspiracy to keep the defeated president in power.

""Donald Trump wanted Mike Pence to do something no other vice president has ever done: the former president wanted Pence to reject the votes and either declare Trump the winner or send the votes back to the states to be counted again,"" panel chairman Bennie Thompson said.

""Mike Pence said no. He resisted the pressure. He knew it was illegal. He knew it was wrong.""

Trump's lawyer John Eastman was the architect of the ""nonsensical"" plot, said committee vice-chair Liz Cheney, pushing the scheme aggressively despite knowing it to be unlawful.

The committee showed testimony from Pence's general counsel Greg Jacob saying Eastman admitted in front of Trump two days before the riot that his plan would violate federal law.

'In danger'

A desperate Trump had turned to Pence for help after dozens of legal challenges against the election were dismissed in courts across the land.

The defeated president used rally speeches and Twitter to exert intense pressure on his deputy to abuse his position as president of the Senate and reject the election results.

Members of Trump's family were in the Oval Office on January 6 when Trump had a ""heated"" phone call with Pence, according to first daughter Ivanka Trump's deposition, aired at the hearing.

She said Trump took ""a different tone"" than she'd heard him use before.

Nicholas Luna, a former assistant to Trump, recalled in his own deposition: ""I remember hearing the word 'wimp.'""

During his ""Stop the Steal"" rally later that day, Trump referenced Pence numerous times as he told his supporters to march on the Capitol and ""fight like hell.""

Trump's original speech didn't mention Pence but he ad-libbed to berate his vice president in a move Democratic committee member Pete Aguilar said helped incite the insurrection and the threats against Pence.

But Pence resisted, releasing a letter to Congress saying the vice president had no ""unilateral authority"" to overturn election counts.

Aguilar said an informant from the neofascist Proud Boys told the FBI the group would have killed Pence given the opportunity.

The California congressman said the mob storming the Capitol came within 40 feet (12 meters) of Pence and to ""make no mistake about the fact that the vice president's life was in danger.""

'Pretty jarring'

Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows told him about the violence erupting at the Capitol but the president tweeted anyway that Pence did not have the ""courage"" to overturn the election, aides told investigators in videotaped depositions.

Immediately after the tweet, the crowds at the Capitol surged forward, the committee said.

The mob threatened to hang Pence for failing to cooperate as they stormed the Capitol, even erecting a gallows in front of the building.

""What the former president was willing to sacrifice -- potentially the vice president -- in order to stay in power is pretty jarring,"" Aguilar said.

The panel aired a video clip of a rioter saying he would ""drag people through the streets"" if Pence refused to overturn the election.

The committee also heard from retired federal judge J Michael Luttig, who testified that the United States would have been plunged into ""a revolution within a paralyzing constitutional crisis"" had Pence folded under Trump's pressure.

Luttig, a renowned conservative legal scholar, had advised Pence at the time that his role in overseeing the ratification of the election was purely ceremonial -- and that he had no power to oppose the result.

""There was no basis in the constitution or the laws of the United States at all for the theory espoused by Mr Eastman. At all. None,"" Luttig said.

Trump reacted to the hearing by demanding that he receive ""equal time"" on the airwaves to lay out his bogus theory that the election was stolen -- but opponents pointed out that he has not taken up the committee's invitation to testify.

https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-05-13/billie-eilish-megan-thee-stallion-planned-parenthood-ny-times-ad,Some of pop’s biggest stars teamed with Planned Parenthood for this Roe v. Wade ad,"Ariana Grande, left, Olivia Rodrigo, Megan Thee Stallion, Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish are listed as supporters of the #BansOffOurBodies campaign in a new Planned Parenthood newspaper ad.

Planned Parenthood has tapped scores of young musicians, entertainers and influencers to condemn the U.S. Supreme Court’s potential decision to strip their “constitutional right to abortion” by overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.

In the New York Times on Friday, 160 female, male and nonbinary individuals listed their names on a full-page ad as part of the organization’s #BansOffOurBodies campaign denouncing the decision and some states’ abortion bans.

Among the many bold-face names are Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, Miley Cyrus, Olivia Rodrigo, Selena Gomez and Shawn Mendes. Joining them are Asa Butterfield, Beanie Feldstein, Bishop Briggs, Finneas, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner, Demi Lovato, Halsey, Hailey Bieber, Hayley Kiyoko, Lauren Jauregui, Madison Beer, Noah Cyrus, Phoebe Bridgers, Lykke Li, Tinashe and Meghan Trainor.

“The Supreme Court is planning to overturn Roe v. Wade, taking away the constitutional right to abortion,” the ad said. “Our power to plan our own futures and control our own bodies depends on our ability to access sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion. We are Artists. Creators. Storytellers. We are the new generation stepping into our power. Now we are being robbed of our power. WE WILL NOT GO BACK — AND WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.”

The ad is one of many that have already begun flooding people’s TVs and phones as the midterm election races heat up. It also comes ahead of Planned Parenthood’s Bans Off Our Bodies Day of Action. The reproductive healthcare provider has teamed up with other organizations such as Women’s March, UltraViolet, MoveOn, Liberate Abortion and SEIU to hold massive rallies and marches across the U.S. on Saturday in support of abortion rights and to protest the high court’s action, which ignited a firestorm earlier this month when a purported draft majority opinion was leaked to Politico.

“Should the Supreme Court take away the constitutional right to safe, legal abortion, young people stand to lose the most,” said Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson in a statement Friday to The Times. “So many of us — who grew up with the understanding that Roe was settled law — could have never imagined that our own children would have fewer rights and less freedom over their own bodies and futures.

“What we see in young people from all walks of life is that they aren’t backing down — not today, not ever,” Johnson added. “Like the artists who signed on to this ad, their resolve to keep bans off their bodies is a source of hope during a dark time, and we are determined to keep fighting alongside them, for them.”

The celebrity-endorsed ad coincides with a number of famous advocates speaking out against limitations and bans on abortion rights in the wake of the SCOTUS leak. Amy Schumer spoke out against it on “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” Rodrigo condemned it while performing onstage, Bridgers shared her abortion story, and countless others have taken to social media to “express their outrage and stand in solidarity with abortion rights and Planned Parenthood’s patients and staff,” the organization said.",Q2
https://www.wcbi.com/west-point-face-capital-murder-charge-understanding-bond-process/,West point teens face capital murder charge:Understanding bond process,"West point teens face capital murder charge: Understanding bond process

OKTIBBEHA COUNTY, Miss. (WCBI)- Prosecutors and investigators are still building the case involving four teenage suspects charged with capital murder.

The teens are accused of killing 41-year-old Mikel Craven in Clay County. All four remain in the Clay County Detention Center.

For juvenile cases, a judge will not only review the type of charge.

They will also review any other criminal offenses the suspect may have been involved with.

41-year-old Mikel Craven was found lying in a ditch near the Pine Grove Road intersection with gunshot wounds. Craven later died in the hospital.

On Wednesday, Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott told WCBI there is no bond for 19-year-old Emerson Stone Houston, 17-year-old William Austin Hill, and 17-year-old Greyson Klutts.

15-year-old Jeremy Klutts has a $75,000 bond. He is required to wear an ankle monitor.

“Our investigators worked around the clock. It was a lot of hard investigating, but we were able to bring this thing to closure. We did receive some good tips and information from the community. It’s just that one little thing that may not seem like much. A lot of times, it’ll help make a case,” said Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott.

All four are charged as adults.

WCBI asked attorney Jeff Hosford of Hosford Law Firm, what goes into charging minors as adults, and what judges consider when they set bonds?

“Anyone over the age of 13 who commits an offense regarding life or the death penalty is eligible to be charged as an adult. The severity of the charge is one of the main factors, and this being the most severe charge may limit their ability to bond at all. That’s up to the court. It’s up to the motions filed by the lawyers and prosecutors,” said Hosford.

Hosford said the court must determine if the defendant is a threat to the community and review other isolated incidents.

“Whether it’s something that can be continued as an ongoing trial or lead to other charges. The common denominator of anybody charged with the crime are they from the area? Are there contacts in the area? Are there people that will ensure they will show up to court? Those things are brought into consideration when setting bond,” said Hosford.

In October of 2021, 17-year-old William Austin Hill was charged with attempted murder for stabbing another person.

Hosford said that investigation and charges won’t be included in the trial.

“From the United States Supreme Court, anyone 15 or younger can not face the death penalty. But, anyone over the age of 15 can face the death penalty in the United States. When someone is charged with these crimes, there are certain things you have to go through for the state to prosecute you,” said Hosford.

Hill, Houston, and Greyson Klutts will be in court for a preliminary hearing on May 19th.",Q2
https://www.times-gazette.com/story/news/2022/04/26/ohio-supreme-court-2022-elections-could-shift-balance-court/7249372001/,Who is running for Ohio Supreme Court? Ohio voters to decide balance of court this year,"The balance of the Ohio Supreme Court hinges this fall on whether two under-funded Democrats on the appellate bench can defeat two incumbent Republican justices named Pat from Cincinnati.

Justice Patrick Fischer is being challenged by 10th District Court of Appeals Judge Terri Jamison and Justice Pat DeWine is challenged by 1st District Court of Appeals Judge Marilyn Zayas.

In recent elections, Democrats have picked up supreme court seats and now hold three of the seven but Republicans have held the court majority since 1986. If DeWine and Fischer both win, Republicans will continue to hold that majority.

This year will be the first time party labels will be listed on the ballot for supreme court and appellate court judicial candidates.

Balance of the court:2022 election will bring different Ohio Supreme Court to ongoing redistricting battles

If the women win, Zayas would be the first Latina to serve on the high court and Jamison would be the third Black woman. Of the 162 justices that have served since 1803, four have been Black and 13 have been women.

Zayas and Jamison both favor establishing a criminal sentencing database across Ohio courts, which would provide data to see how similarly charged people are treated across courts. DeWine and Fischer said they need more information about how the database would operate before deciding whether to support it.

Supreme Court decisions impact how much Ohioans pay in taxes, whether utility companies can add fees to ratepayers' bills, how insurance and business laws are interpreted, what government records will be available to the public and more. The court also plays an enormous role in ruling whether legislative and congressional maps created by the Ohio Redistricting Commission are constitutional.

Justices serve six-year terms.

Who is Marilyn Zayas?

Zayas, who grew up in Spanish Harlem and Brooklyn, vividly remembers visiting family court in New York as her mother fought for custody amid a contentious divorce.

Zayas, who acted as an unofficial translator for her mom, recognized that lawyers helped people's voices be heard – something that sparked her interest in becoming a lawyer.

Instead of pursuing that path, Zayas studied computer programming, which she viewed as a sure bet for economic security and achieving her goals of leaving New York City and owning a home with a yard.

After graduation, Zayas jumped at a job offer from Procter & Gamble and immediately felt at home in Cincinnati.

Still, the dream of becoming a lawyer stuck with her. While pregnant with her third child, Zayas began studying for the LSAT and started law school at the University of Cincinnati following her maternity leave.

She practiced intellectual property law for a firm in Colorado but returned to Cincinnati and took a job as a Hamilton County public defender and later operated her own firm, specializing in immigration, juvenile, family and criminal matters.

As a political newbie, she ran for the First District Court of Appeals in 2016, beating a Republican incumbent.

She said she would've ruled differently than DeWine on the redistricting cases as well as a bail case. In a 4-3 ruling issued in January, the court found the state constitution and U.S. Constitution prohibit setting excessively high bail just to keep someone charged with a crime in jail before trial. DeWine dissented. Zayas said she would have agreed with the majority opinion.

She also said she would have sided with the majority in the legislative and congressional redistricting cases where political maps were deemed unconstitutional. DeWine dissented in those cases.

Zayas decided she needed to run for Ohio Supreme Court.

""Not because it's easy but because it's necessary. For this seat, it's absolutely necessary. This is really about the integrity and independence of the court and it's about serving everybody,"" she said. ""I'm not here to serve one group of people. I'm here to serve everyone.""

Zayas: First District Court of Appeals, 2016 to current; computer programmer for Procter & Gamble. Bachelor's degree from City College of New York, law degree from University of Cincinnati.

Who is Pat DeWine?

As the oldest child of Ohio Gov. Mike and Fran DeWine, Pat DeWine literally grew up in Republican politics. Hanging on his office wall is a photo of a young Pat DeWine with his parents, siblings and President Ronald Reagan. But he came to a career in politics and the law later in life.

Even when he started attending University of Michigan Law School, he wasn't sure he wanted to practice law. But in his third year, a clerkship with the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals changed that.

""I loved that. To me I just thought it was a fascinating job. You get to see so many different things,"" he said. ""That kind of got me on the path.""

DeWine was in private practice and held local elected office but decided to run for the bench as a way to focus on the law but also continue public service.

DeWine served as a trial court judge and appellate judge before winning a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2016. ""I love the face that we make decisions that have a real impact for the entire state,"" he said of the high court.

DeWine describes himself as a ""textualist"" – a judge who sticks to the plain reading of the law – and supports the rule of law and creating a predictable legal environment.

He noted that in Third World countries, the lack of predictability drives away business investment. ""I think Ohio is at risk of having a legal environment that's not very stable, not very predictable,"" DeWine said.

DeWine said businesses want a stable legal environment or they consider going elsewhere.

While it has yet to make endorsements, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce announced it plans to to raise and spend $4 million in the supreme court races this fall.

DeWine said a healthy supreme court is one with judges that apply the law as written and understand the court isn't a policy-making branch. ""Do we have that now? I'm concerned, frankly,"" he said.

DeWine noted the 4-3 decision over setting bail, citing it as an example of the court ""going beyond what its authority is in law and instead imposing its own policy preferences.""

Critics have hammered DeWine for not recusing himself in the highly contentious redistricting cases. DeWine, however, said no party specifically asked him to recuse and his father is one of seven members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission.

""What I did in those cases is the same as I've done in every case since I went on the court – determine whether my father had some kind of personal interest or super personal benefit from a case. If he does, I recuse myself. If he doesn't, I have a duty to hear the case that the voters elected me to hear,"" DeWine said.

DeWine: Ohio Supreme Court, 2017 to current; First District Court of Appeals; Hamilton County Common Pleas Court; Hamilton County commissioner; Cincinnati City Council. Bachelor's degree from Miami University, law degree from University of Michigan.

Who is Terri Jamison?

Jamison grew up in Welch, W.Va., where she began her education in segregated schools. She considers Brown v. Board of Education as the first case to personally impact her since it eventually led her to attending integrated schools.

Republican justices on the Ohio Supreme Court often stress the importance of a strict reading of laws and avoiding legislating from the bench. Jamison noted that when the U.S. Constitution was written, Black Americans weren't counted as citizens.

Diversity on the Bench:'Rooting for her': Black women judges in Ohio on nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson

""I look at the law from a very different perspective because I understand that the role of a judge is to give equal protection under the law. It is to give us the right to have equal rights in these United States,"" she said in an address to the Federalist Society.

She added that the courts have the right to interpret legislation and make sure it is constitutional, applied equally and citizens' rights are protected.

Jamison took a long, winding path to the judicial bench.

She worked as an underground coal miner but after a layoff, she moved to Columbus. After job training, she worked in a series of businesses, including an insurance agency. Eventually she ran her own agency for more than 16 years.

While working, she took classes at Columbus State Community College, transferred to Franklin University and graduated with a business degree. She sold her insurance agency to go to Capital University Law School. After a stint as a county public defender, Jamison started her own firm, focusing on criminal, juvenile, domestic and appellate work.

In 2012, she won a seat on the Franklin County Common Pleas bench in the domestic relations-juvenile division. In 2018 she won reelection.

Jamison, who is married to a retired deputy sheriff in Franklin County, said she supports law and order ""but I am in favor of the law being applied to everyone equally and everyone treated the same.""

She said her working class background, varied work history and experience holding trials gives her an important understanding of people and where they may be coming from.

""I think they need another justice who is independent and believes in the independence of the third branch of government, to be a check and balance on the legislature and the executive branch by interpreting the law as written, to be sure that it is constitutional and grants equal justice under the law to everyone – making it a reality for everyone,"" Jamison said.

Jamison noted that redistricting may return to the Ohio Supreme Court in 2026 when the four-year maps expire. So election of justices in 2022 and 2024 are key. ""That's how critical this election is....So, if we want an independent judiciary in the Supreme Court, we need to choose wisely in '22 and '24.""

Jamison: Tenth District Court of Appeals, 2021 to current; Franklin County Common Pleas, 2012-2020, private practice attorney, Franklin County assistant public defender, insurance agency owner. Associate's degree, Columbus State Community College; Bachelor's degree, Franklin University; law degree, Capital University. Former coal miner in West Virginia.

Who is Pat Fischer?

As a kid growing up in Fort Thomas, Fischer was called as a witness when his brother Joe was charged with reckless driving.

Fischer was immediately taken in by the courtroom, the repartee between lawyers and the judge, the ambience and even the fresh smell of lemon Pledge on the furnishings.

""I always wanted to be a lawyer from eighth grade on when I testified at that trial,"" Fischer said. ""I was the last one to testify. I was out in the hallway all by myself. I was 14 years old. They opened those big wooden doors and I walked up there and I loved it.""

His brother Joe, who was acquitted, is a Kentucky state lawmaker and now running for the Kentucky supreme court.

Pat Fischer took a direct path to the law. He graduated St. Xavier High School and went to undergraduate and law school at Harvard.

After graduation, Fischer spent 27 years in private practice, most of it at Keating Muething & Klekamp, a Cincinnati-based corporate law firm.

But an experience in a 2004 election law case convinced him that he wanted to be a judge.

He represented intervenors in a federal case during the 2004 presidential election between George W. Bush and John Kerry. Fischer's side lost at the trial level, won an appeal and the other side took it to the U.S. Supreme Court – all with blazing speed and urgency.

""I got a decision from Justice John Paul Stevens at 5:27 a.m. and then I went to vote for president and realized I wanted to be a judge,"" he said.

In 2010, Fischer won a seat on the 1st District Court of Appeals where he served until his election to the Ohio Supreme Court in 2016.

""I love the research. I love the writing. I love the time available to think,"" he said of his work on the high court.

When asked why voters should back him, Fischer said ""I am not just the most qualified candidate but also the one who cares more in his heart about making sure that the rule of law continues in this state and in this country.""

When asked how he knows what's in Jamison's heart, Fischer responded: ""I know that no one could have more intensity for the law. I gave up so much to be here.""

The career shift from law firm partner to judge meant he took a steep pay cut, he said.

Fischer said he favors applying the law as written, not legislating from the bench or allowing his personal feelings about a law influence his rulings.

When it comes to the redistricting cases, Fischer joined the minority on the court and voted to uphold the Republican-drawn legislative and congressional maps as constitutional. The cases exposed a divide on the seven-member court but Fischer noted that in his dissents he criticizes the opinion and legal reasoning – not the individual justices.

It's important to know how to disagree without being disagreeable, he said. ""That would help our entire country and it would the reputation of lawyers.""

The Laclede County Sheriff’s Office said 22-year-old Dillion Bacon was arrested on Saturday and charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. He’s being held without bond.

The sheriff’s office said it responded to a 911 call at about 2:30 Saturday afternoon and found Megan Glasser, 21, dead.

A probable cause statement for Bacon’s arrest says that the suspect told officers he and Glasser and been arguing and that he took a gun out of his pocket and began waving it around, according to KY3. Glasser reportedly yelled at him to put it away, then reached for the gun. Bacon said it went off, but he denied shooting Glasser on purpose.

Bacon also reportedly told officers that he and Glasser had argued in the past and that Glasser had been injured when the arguments turned physical, but he also denied that those injuries were intentional.

Bacon’s grandparents were at the home at the time of the shooting, telling police they had witnessed their grandson assault Glasser in the past and that they had told her to end the relationship, the probable cause statement said.

An autopsy will be conducted on Monday, police said.

Court records show that Bacon has a warrant for his arrest on domestic assault charges in Joplin.

https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/mesa/man-accused-of-firing-100-shots-in-mesa-neighborhood,Man accused of firing 100 shots in Mesa neighborhood,"MESA — A 21-year-old man is accused of firing nearly 100 rounds from firearms in a Mesa neighborhood drive-by shooting.

The incident occurred on May 15 near Alma School and Broadway roads just after midnight.

Mesa police say 21-year-old Jorge de Jesus Rubio and another man tried to get into a party while armed with a handgun and assault rifle, according to a victim. Police say the men were asked to leave and went back to their vehicle, and gunfire erupted as they drove away.

The victim reportedly found two bullet holes in their house and one on a vehicle. In total, officers found 98 spent rounds from several weapons, including 9mm, .40 caliber, and .223/5.56 casings.

Police say the home that was shot was occupied and children were also inside. No injuries were reported.

About a week later, Rubio was stopped by police in Phoenix after doing “donuts” at an intersection. Officers located a loaded gun and ammunition. A search warrant also uncovered more ammunition and firearm-related items.

Rubio was arrested on Wednesday on charges including drive-by shooting, prohibited possession, and discharging a firearm at an occupied structure.",Q2
https://www.blackenterprise.com/former-atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-tapped-for-senior-post-in-biden-administration/,Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms Tapped For Senior Post In Biden Administration,"Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is joining the Biden administration in a senior role with the White House Office of Public Engagement.

The former mayor, who left the post after one term, announced the news on Instagram Tuesday and will succeed former Congressman Cedric Richmond who left the post earlier this year. The White House Office of Public Engagement serves as a bridge between the Biden-Harris administration and the American public.

Axios reports Lance Bottoms will be responsible for navigating divergent policy goals between progressives and centrists ahead of what could be a contentious midterm election cycle for Democrats. Lance Bottoms is likely to have a direct line to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and could become one of the public faces of the administration. She will also have access to some of the highest-level planning and strategy sessions in the White House.

Lance Bottoms said in the new role she plans to do “more listening than anything.”

“It’s important that people feel their voices are reflected and their voices are heard,” Lance Bottoms told Axios.

Lance Bottoms was one of Biden’s earliest supporters in 2019, more than a year before the presidential election. She also stumped for the president during the Iowa Caucus and was considered for the vice president post before Harris was selected.

After Biden was elected, he offered Lance Bottoms a position in his cabinet, but she turned it down. Biden also hosted a fundraiser for Lance Bottoms before she announced she wouldn’t run for reelection. During her time as Atlanta mayor, she had to deal with a citywide ransomware attack, the Black Lives Matter protests, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to constant fights between her and Gov. Brian Kemp over mask mandates in schools and indoor establishments.

Before joining the White House, Lance Bottoms served as a political contributor for CNN.",Q2

http://www.positivelyfilipino.com/magazine/the-battle-of-tamparan-and-the-forgotten-moro-heroes-of-world-war-ii,The Battle of Tamparan and the Forgotten Moro Heroes of World War II — Positively Filipino,"In 1903, U.S. Captain John J. Pershing had launched a brutal campaign to “pacify” the Maranao communities around the lake through overwhelming force—one that resulted in at least 400 Maranao deaths by artillery fire.

In 1942, the Japanese army attempted their own pacification program. Initially, every household was required to turn in all firearms, while chopping tools were limited to one for every two households. The Maranaos surrendered a few defective rifles and some old rusty blades. The Japanese then threatened to shoot any Maranao they found with a gun and did so, executing each violator immediately in a public square. Those public executions provided the initial spark for an eventual wildfire of Maranao retaliation.

In June 1942, the Japanese commander of the Dansalan garrison sent a punitive expedition to Watu, a small village on the western shore of the lake, looking for Manalao Mindalano, the first Maranao leader to launch attacks against them. The surprised villagers of Watu, who had no connection to Mindalano, were trapped against the lakeshore as they tried to escape the soldiers, who methodically bayoneted men and women alike, killing 24 in all.

In reprisal, the Maranaos attacked a Japanese convoy, firing well-aimed volleys into the drivers and tires of speeding trucks and sending them careening off roads and tumbling from bridges. The Japanese responded by burning scores of houses along the road where the ambush was laid. The cycle of retaliation was underway.

The Battle of Tamparan

In September 1942, the Maranaos dealt the Japanese a stunning loss when, in a spontaneous attack, a collection of villagers armed primarily with blades nearly annihilated an entire company of Japanese infantry. The Battle of Tamparan was the gravest defeat inflicted on the Imperial Japanese Army by irregular forces in the Philippines and quite likely their greatest loss at the hands of civilians in the entire course of the Pacific War. For the Japanese infantry, it was a defeat as improbable, shameful, and symbolically charged as that suffered by the U.S. cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn but, unlike that iconic defeat, it has been mostly lost from history.",Q2

Guest columnist

There are striking parallels between America’s public health epidemics and our gun violence crisis. I wish that we could have prevented all the pain caused by the most recent mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, but realize now that prevention itself is a concept that seems to be absent among our country's leaders.

As a pediatrician, I strongly believe in the importance of preventive medicine. Preventive medicine works to prevent disease from occurring when possible, instead of waiting for disease onset in order to start treatment. This approach to public health has been proven to control both health care costs and chronic, life-threatening illnesses.

True preventive health care often becomes an impossible feat in America, where many are without adequate access. We find ourselves in a snowball effect of poor health and high health care costs.

It is clear that America has a problem with prevention itself. We wait until damage has been done and the root issue has got away from us. I think about the recent COVID-19 epidemic and how, instead of early vaccine endorsement, many U.S. leaders seeded doubt in the vaccine, while supporting COVID-19 treatments once patients are already infected.

According to a recent article by NPR, researchers at Brown University and Microsoft AI Health estimate that over 300,000 deaths due to COVID could have been avoided if vaccination had been universal. People died because our country's leaders politicized vaccination rather than focusing on disease prevention. With 1 million Americans now dead from COVID-19, it makes one wish we could start over.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Another public health issue that should be addressed with appropriate prevention efforts is abortion. With the possibility of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, I have seen abortion debated all over social media, but I rarely see leadership prioritize funding the steps we can take before arriving at abortion.

In my experience, pro-choice people agree that abortion should be “safe, legal and rare.” I think common sense tells us that access to health care, access to birth control and extensive, science-based inclusive sex education would prevent thousands of unplanned pregnancies. Instead, many women find themselves in a dire position and abortion as their best choice, looking back in time how they could have prevented this.

In the wake of another horrific shooting that stole the future of 19 innocent children and two incredibly brave teachers, it is clear that our nation is again letting citizens down by not investing in proper prevention. Gun violence is an increasingly dire issue for children and adolescents as the leading cause of death of children and teens in the U.S.

Following the most recent tragedy in Uvalde, I’ve seen countless people take to the internet calling for the arming of teachers or increased security in schools. My question, the same question I have when it comes to COVID, abortion, obesity and countless other issues in our nation, is: Why don’t we start at the root of the problem?

Why don’t we prevent these atrocious shootings from ever starting rather than asking our teachers to engage in gun combat to protect our children? Why don’t we ban assault rifles instead of increasing the security presence at schools? Why don’t we increase the age limit required for the purchase of firearms instead of bulletproofing classroom windows? Why don’t we run background checks and psychological evaluations before firearm purchase instead of suggesting homeschooling for our kids?

Additionally, these questions don’t even begin to address the mass shootings which occur outside of schools. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been more than 220 mass shootings in 2022 alone.

We cannot get stuck in the never-ending reactive cycle of reports of these appalling events — shock and despair, indignation, followed by angry tweeting and, eventually, acceptance that things will never change. We need to fight for policy change. We must hold the leadership of our nation accountable for the lives that have been lost to gun violence. We must vote for leaders who promise to enact the change that will prevent these past tragedies from ever happening again.

If you would like Congress to act on gun control, start by calling them today and ask them to vote yes on H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 and H.R. 1446 the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-senate-negotiators-reach-deal-on-us10b-for-covid-19-aid,US Senate negotiators reach deal on US$10b for Covid-19 aid,"US President Joe Biden has said more funding is needed as the world continues to fight Covid-19 in the pandemic's third year. PHOTO: REUTERS

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - Negotiators in Congress have agreed to an additional US$10 billion (S$13.6 billion) in Covid-19 funding to address US needs but have dropped international aid from the package, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday (April 4).

The compromise, if passed, would be less than half of the US$22.5 billion initially sought by United States President Joe Biden to combat Covid-19, prepare for future variants and shore up the nation's pandemic infrastructure.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki in a statement urged Congress to move ""promptly"".

Mr Biden has said more funding is needed as the world continues to fight Covid-19 in the pandemic's third year. While US officials have said they do not expect a surge from the latest Omicron BA.2 sub-variant, they have pointed to the need to continue to make vaccines available at no cost and to boost surveillance and testing.

US regulators last week approved a second booster shot for older and immunocompromised Americans, but administration officials have said that without more funding from Congress, money will run out for the free shots.

""The consequences of inaction are severe,"" Mr Biden warned lawmakers at a White House event last week.

Lawmakers had been weighing a US$15 billion measure that included US$5 billion in international aid. Health experts have said that without full global immunisation efforts, the virus can continue to mutate, increasing the risk of infection and vaccine evasion.

Members of Congress negotiating the package, however, could not agree on how to pay for the global response. One of the negotiators, Republican Senator Mitt Romney, said he was open to funding global efforts in a separate, ""fiscally responsible solution"" in the coming weeks.

A Senate vote on the US$10 billion measure could come as soon as this week. Approval would send it to the House of Representatives.

https://apnews.com/article/politics-detroit-michigan-mount-clemens-371fc4a8daa1a9f8c338d5e5749e0a2f,"Michigan man faces trial in girlfriend’s killing, mutilation","CLINTON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — A suburban Detroit man accused of fatally strangling his girlfriend and living with her mutilated corpse for more than seven months has been ordered to stand trial in the killing.

Matthew Lewinski, 38, was bound over to Macomb County Circuit Court on Thursday on charges of first-degree murder, mutilation of a corpse and concealment of a corpse, The Macomb Daily of Mount Clemens reported.

Lewinski remains held without bond. He is charged in the death of Courtney “Jerri” Winters, whose mutilated body was found in Lewinski’s basement in July 2021.

Lewinski’s defense attorney, Elisha Oakes, told The Associated Press on Friday that she had no comment on her client being ordered to trial.

Clinton Township District Court Judge Sebastian Lucido suggested Thursday that police should have read Lewinski his Miranda rights when they began to question him in a hospital bed in July 2021, before he made admissions about choking Winters.

Carey Lamont – held without bail

A prosecutor said that Carey Lamont Reid Jr. cried and confessed to murdering a 77-year-old Oceanside man, and then he wrote an apology letter to the widow.

Widow Zui Pang, 41, with prosecutor Watanabe

Prosecutor Keith Watanabe spoke at the arraignment of Reid, now 21, who pleaded not-guilty to murdering John Anthony Roth. Special circumstances of murder-during-residential-burglary have been charged, which makes this case eligible for the death penalty.

It was August 14, when the elderly man was killed in his own home.

The elderly man was found on his couch, with stab wounds in his neck, in his three-story home in the 500 block of North Tremont Street. The victim’s wife, Zui Pang, 41, discovered her husband about 6 am that Tuesday, when she came home from her night work at a nursing home, police said.

The suspect was found last Sunday, October 21, after a caller reported seeing a “transient” sleeping in a parking lot. One of the responding Oceanside police officers happened to be detective Erik Ellgard, who is the lead investigator for the murder case. Reid was arrested at 515 North Coast Highway, across an alley from the crime scene.

Prosecutor Watanabe complained that it took the San Diego County Sheriff’s crime lab two months to come up with a DNA profile from a soda can that was found at the crime scene. When the DNA profile was put into the law enforcement search engine CODIS, it quickly matched a suspect from South Carolina, according to Watanabe. The murder suspect Carey Reid Jr. was found and arrested two days after his DNA was identified.

Prosecutor Watanabe said Reid is guilty of a “hot prowl” because he got away with loot stolen from an occupied home; the stolen articles allegedly included a purse and jewelry and valuable Chinese coins dating from the Ming dynasty.

The murder occurred three weeks before Reid turned 21. The defendant looks younger than his years, jail records describe him as 5 feet 7 inches tall and 130 pounds.

The prosecutor said that in his confession to investigators, Reid told officers he regretted his crime, admitting it was “stupid” and done in “anger.”

The widow Pang spoke to local news cameras after the court hearing. In a soft voice she praised her husband as a good, hardworking man. Watanabe mentioned that Pang met her future husband in China.

At the arraignment on Wednesday, October 24, the defendant was declared a danger to the community and a flight risk, and judge James E. Simmons Jr. ordered him held without bail.",Q2

Britany Barron , 33, testified at her husband's first-degree murder trial that she and her co-worker were brutally assaulted by her husband in the hours leading up to the death that night.

She claims her husband choked and punched her and eventually put his gun into her mouth.

""You know that you're going to die tonight, right?"" she testified her husband, Armando Barron, said in September 2020, not long before the two left the house to go to the park where he allegedly used her phone to tell the co-worker to meet her there.

""Don't do anything stupid or the girls are going to walk into something (expletive) gruesome,"" she testified he said as they were leaving.

He had sent the couple's three young children to go to their grandmother's home next door.

On the way to the park, he read the texts aloud, striking her after finishing each one, she said.

Britany, who asked a prosecutor in the Keene courtroom to address her by her maiden name, Mitchell, also testified that just a week earlier, she had told Armando she no longer loved him and wanted a divorce.

When he heard that, he grabbed her throat and started choking her, saying, ""Are you serious?""

She denied early in her testimony that she was the one who shot Jonathan Amerault, as a defence lawyer alleged during opening statements Tuesday.

She pointed to her husband as the shooter.

Barron pleaded not guilty to killing Amerault, 25.

He acknowledged in court on Tuesday that he had struck Britany, broke her nose, attempted to strangle her, and kicked Amerault in the head.

Prosecutors allege that Armando Barron, 32, used his wife's cellphone to lure Amerault to the park just north of the Massachusetts state line the night he discovered the texts, beat and kicked Amerault and and tried to force his wife to shoot him.

She refused. He also forced her to stand on his neck and slit his wrists, they said.

Armando Barron forced Amerault into the back of the victim's car and told Britany to get into the driver's seat, she testified.

At one point, he left them alone, she said.

There was a machete inside and Britany testified that Amerault told her to pick it up and kill her husband, but she said no.

""I wasn't going to test him,"" she said.

She said Armando Barron eventually got into the car and shot Amerault three times.

Barron had his wife drive the car back to their home in Jaffrey to pack some supplies, and he followed in the couple's car.

They then headed 200 miles north (322 kilometres) to a remote campsite, with Barron talking on the phone with her throughout the trip, she testified.

There, Armando Barron allegedly forced her to cut off Amerault's head and bury it and wrap the body in a tarp.

He left her to dispose of the body and returned home, she testified.

""He said that we needed to cut off his head so that there would be no dental records of the body,"" Britany testified, saying she used a saw brought from home.

She testified that they both destroyed evidence.

The body was found by New Hampshire Fish and Game officers in a swamp after they found Britany at the campsite, where she was not allowed to camp.

Britany testified that she and Amerault got to know each other better while working on a project in the days leading to his death and communicated via texting and social media apps.

One afternoon, they drove to a nearby park after work and talked. She described him as kind, sweet and funny.

""I said I couldn't offer anything more than friendship,"" she testified, and later gave him a quick kiss when he returned her to work so she could get her car.

They shared one more kiss during a work break that week, a day before the texts were discovered.

Britany pleaded guilty last year to three counts of falsifying evidence and was released from jail on parole last month.

She apologised to Amerault's family during her sentencing.

https://wobm.com/road-rage-driver-gets-life-for-murder-in-freehold/,Road Rage driver gets life for shooting a woman in Freehold,"Kader Mustafa, a 40-year-old man from Mercer County will spend the rest of his life behind prison walls and won't even become eligible for parole until he turns 104-years old for maliciously murdering a woman driving along Route 33 West in Freehold Township on this day in 2018, Acting Monmouth County Prosecutor Lori Linskey announced on Tuesday.

On Thursday, May 3, 2018, 24-year old Sciasia Calhoun was driving a 1997 Mazda Protege along Route 33 West near the exit for Halls Mill Road in Freehold Township as she and her 1-year-old daughter and boyfriend were on their way to Asbury Park but then realized the headlights on the vehicle weren't working, just the high beams were that night, according to Judge Vincent N. Falcetano Jr. who oversaw the case in court.

She turned the car around and the three of them were heading back home when they came across Mustafa in a 2005 Chevrolet Impala who started firing a gun right at them and hit Sciascia Calhoun in the head but somehow had the presence of mind at that moment to bring the car to safety.

“Her last act,” Judge Falcetano said in court, ""was to somehow safely pull over the vehicle to the side of the road, despite having been shot by a man he described as a “cauldron of rage” who was “marauding … aimlessly” that night, while armed. “This was completely random. I don’t have enough words in my vocabulary to describe it.”

Sciasia Calhoun was the only one injured in the vehicle with her boyfriend and 1-year-old daughter not suffering any injuries.

Freehold Township Police arrived on the scene on a 911 call around 11:45 pm and shortly thereafter, Calhoun was rushed by Freehold First Aid, with the assistance of Monmouth-Ocean Hospital Service Corporation to CentraState Medical Center.

She was pronounced dead about one hour later at the hospital.

Mustafa was driving and suddenly fired a shot at Calhoun after following her for several minutes and tapped her rear bumper along the way, according to the investigation conducted by the MCPO Major Crimes Bureau and Freehold Police with ""significant assistance from the Manalapan Police Department.""

The following morning, at 8:10 am, Mustafa was arrested at his cousin’s residence near Oakland Mills Road in Manalapan where police also found two handguns.

According to the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, many members of Calhoun's family spoke in court at the sentencing on Monday.

""They described a “diamond in the rough” with ample ambition and a fierce independent streak, who stubbornly refused to let anyone help her learn how to ride a bicycle as a young child – despite bumps, bruises, and scratches piling up – until she had perfected it on her own.""

“The defendant chose to randomly fire a shot and randomly kill a 24-year-old who had done absolutely nothing to him,” MCPO Director of Investigations Christopher Decker, who represented the State at sentencing, said in court, according to the MCPO. “There’s nothing more depraved or heinous.”

Mustafa was convicted by a jury in October of 2021 on first-degree Murder, second-degree Possession of a Weapon for an Unlawful Purpose, two counts of second-degree Unlawful Possession of a Weapon, and two counts of third-degree Endangering Another Person.

MCPO Investigation Division Director and Assistant Prosecutor John Loughrey, who Acting Prosecutor Linskey said has since retired, handled the prosecution of this case.

The senator was booed by the youths at the primary election venue held at Prof. Theophilus Ogunlesi Hall, opposite UCH, Ibadan.

Senator Balogun, a younger brother of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Lekan Balogun, was elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party in 2019.

High school ring returned to US soldier's family (Photo: KGMB/Kuroda family)

HONOLULU, HI (CBS) — The high school ring on a man who was killed in combat during WWII is being returned to his family nearly 80 years later on the other side of the world.

During World War II, brothers Ronald and Robert Kuroda fought alongside other Japanese-Americans against Nazi Germany.

Ronald in the famed 100th Infantry Battalion, Robert with the highly decorated 442nd Regimental Combat Team.

“They were proving their loyalty to a country that did not quite trust them,” Staff Sgt. Robert Kuroda’s Nephew Kevin Kuroda said.

In October, 1944, Staff Sgt. Robert Kuroda was killed in combat near Bruyeres, France, where he also lost his high school ring.

“When you look at it now, it’s shiny. You can still see Farrington High School. You can still see the words that say, ‘Enter to learn. Go forth to serve,'” Kuroda said.

Last November, a Frenchman named Sebastian found the class ring while he was out walking with his metal detector in the forest near Bruyeres. It was buried about eight inches deep for almost 80 years.

“All he saw was Farrington High School, 1940, and on the inside, it had the initial R. Kuroda,” Kuroda said.

Sebastian searched the internet for months until he found Kuroda’s relatives, who are extremely grateful that he went that extra mile.

“He went out of his way, did the research and wanted it returned to the family, and that’s what he did,” Kuroda said.

Last month, Kevin Kuroda and his family went to Bruyeres to meet Sebastian and, to receive the ring, and to thank him for his kindness. He took them into the forest where Sgt. Kuroda and his 442 comrades bravely fought against the enemy.

“We actually went to the spot where he believes uncle Robert was killed.”

Ronald Kuroda received a Distinguished Service Cross for his valor during the war in Europe.

In 2000, President Clinton presented the Kuroda family with a Medal of Honor for Robert’s heroism.

An area near the Hale Koa Hotel is dedicated to Sgt Kuroda’s memory.

The high school ring is another reminder of him.

“It means the world to us. It means the world to us and our family,” Kuroda said.

And it’s more than a family treasure. The Kurodas say the ring is a glimpse into the past, at a generation of Nisei who put America first and paid with their lives.",Q2

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/09/texas-abortion-ban-oklahoma/,"A refuge for Texas patients, Oklahoma clinics brace for abortion ban","SAN ANTONIO — The woman stared up at the ceiling, taking slow, deep breaths, as the doctor examined the flickering dot on the ultrasound screen. “What’s going on?” she asked. The gut-wrenching news came in two parts: The flickering was a sign of cardiac activity, which meant the woman could not get an abortion under Texas’ six-week ban. And while the doctor, Alan Braid, said he would refer her to a sister clinic in Oklahoma, where he has sent hundreds of other patients since the law took effect last year, she would need to hurry. Lawmakers there were close to passing a law just as strict as the one in Texas.

The woman cried as the reality sank in.

By the time she arrived for an appointment in Oklahoma, abortion could be banned there, too.

As soon as Texas enacted its six-week ban, people started fleeing the state for abortions. And while Texas patients have fanned out to abortion clinics all over the country, experts say no state has absorbed more of them than neighboring Oklahoma, where abortions remain legal until the 22nd week of pregnancy.

But that could change soon. As Oklahoma’s Republican-led legislature has rushed in recent days to cut off what GOP leaders have called a “sickening” patient pipeline from Texas — seeking to enact a raft of new restrictions — doctors and patients have faced mounting complications, with doctors preparing for a sudden end to abortion access and patients racing to schedule appointments before it’s too late.

An all-out ban, which passed the legislature last week, could take effect this summer if the Supreme Court rolls back its landmark Roe v. Wade decision protecting abortion rights. More worrisome to abortion rights advocates is the likelihood that Oklahoma moves as early as next week to enact a Texas-style ban, which has thus far survived court challenges. If Oklahoma’s clinics stop providing abortions, or are limited to providing care only before the six week mark, Texas and Oklahoma patients will be pushed farther afield, to Louisiana, Kansas, or New Mexico, where clinics are already fully booked.

The urgency of the moment is acutely felt at the clinic in San Antonio, Alamo Women’s Reproductive Services, and its sister clinic in Tulsa, both of which are owned by Braid, who made national headlines in September for performing an illegal abortion on a patient and writing about it in an opinion piece published by The Washington Post, hoping to prompt lawsuits that would help overturn the law.

Since the Texas ban took effect, Braid has traveled to Oklahoma at least once a month, performing abortions for some of the patients he has had to turn away in Texas.

“At least there was an alternative,” said Braid. If a ban takes effect in Oklahoma, he said, “I will feel totally helpless.”

Braid and his staff recently decided to start telling patients about the pending legislation in Oklahoma.

“Are you aware of the Oklahoma law?” the receptionist in San Antonio asked for the third time that morning, as she scheduled an appointment for another woman who was too far along to get an abortion in Texas.

“What?” said Nejmin, a 25-year-old mother of two, who, like other patients interviewed for this story, spoke on condition that only her first name be used to protect her privacy.

Nejmin had only just learned about the abortion ban in Texas.

Oklahoma’s law “is also changing?” she asked.

“We’re not sure yet,” the receptionist said. “If it changes, we’ll call you.”

***

By 9 a.m. on a recent Thursday, almost every seat in the waiting room at the Tulsa Women’s Clinic was taken.

The women gathered there that morning looked like they could have been going to a sleepover. They wore tie-dye joggers, plaid pajama pants, fuzzy slippers, crocs with thick wool socks. Several curled up in hard-backed chairs, feet on the seat, head burrowed in their knees, as a TV at the front of the room spouted news about Ukraine.

“People are just really tired when they get here,” said Andrea Gallegos, who is Braid’s daughter and the clinic’s executive administrator. She flies back and forth between the clinics in San Antonio and Tulsa. “Some have driven all night to be here first thing in the morning.”

A few miles from downtown Tulsa, the abortion clinic faces a park owned by the local Catholic diocese. Antiabortion protesters gather here every day, lining up with their rosaries in front of a towering white cross.

“Save your baby,” they yell at patients as they pull into the parking lot.

On that Thursday, a third of the cars outside the clinic had Texas plates.

Tulsa Women’s Clinic started seeing a sharp uptick in Texas patients as soon as the law took effect in the fall, said Gallegos. In August, they treated 28 patients from Texas. By November, that number had soared to over 300.

Of the thousands of patients who left Texas to access abortion between September and December, 45 percent traveled to Oklahoma, according to a study from the University of Texas at Austin, far more than have gone to any other state, with New Mexico coming in a distant second.

Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma City have been paying close attention to that surge.

“A state of emergency exists in Oklahoma,” said state Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat (R), the leader of the Senate, referring to the number of abortions that have been performed in Oklahoma since the Texas law took effect.

“It’s sickening,” Treat said. “And that’s the reason we’re making every effort to get our laws changed.”

Treat has been fighting to end abortion access since he was elected over decade ago. For him and other Oklahoma legislators, he said, antiabortion policies are “at the core of who we are.”

Sen. Julie Daniels (R), who sponsored a measure this session modeled after the Texas ban, said she deeply empathizes with women who find themselves pregnant unexpectedly. She agrees with her Democratic colleagues that lawmakers need to do more to support those women, she said. But she believes they should limit abortion access at the same time.

“I believe in saving the children even as we work on those other things,” Daniels said.

Daniels has been drawn to the novel legal strategy behind Texas’s abortion ban, which empowers private citizens to enforce the law through civil litigation.

To many abortion providers in Oklahoma, the Texas-style bill is even more concerning than the abortion ban that passed on Tuesday, Gallegos said, because it could take effect any day.

If an immediate ban is approved, Gallegos said, she imagines she might get a call from the clinic’s lawyers in the middle of the work day, as doctors are performing abortions, with a waiting room full of patients who have driven hours to get there. At any moment, she said, the lawyers might tell her it all has to stop.

Several abortion clinics in the state stopped scheduling appointments in late March in preparation for that bill to pass. While the Tulsa Women’s Clinic has continued to book appointments through the end of April, Gallegos said, they have wrestled with that decision.

Advertisement

“Every day I’m like, ‘do we stop scheduling?’” she said. “There are times when I’m like, ‘absolutely not,’ and other times I’m like, ‘I don’t know.’”

Gallegos doesn’t want to turn away patients if her clinic can still offer abortion care, she said. But she dreads having to call each patient on the schedule and inform them that the law has taken effect.

Patients have already been struggling to book appointments in Oklahoma. Faith, 24, said she’d tried to schedule an abortion at the clinic where she lives in Oklahoma City. Then she tried a few clinics in Kansas, she said, and she couldn’t get in there quickly, either.

When she couldn’t get an appointment, she said, she opened a private browser and started googling “alternatives to abortion.”

“I googled the other methods of ending a pregnancy,” said Faith. “Things like, inserting sharp objects, consuming high amounts of things.”

Advertisement

She was relieved when she was finally able to get an appointment at the Planned Parenthood in Tulsa, she said. But if she hadn’t been able to access legal abortion in her region, she said, she still would have found a way to terminate her pregnancy.

“I’m definitely the kind of person if someone tells me ‘no’ one way, I’m going to go find all the alternative ways to do things,” Faith said.

The vast majority of patients at Tulsa Women’s Clinic haven’t heard anything about the looming abortion bans in Oklahoma, said Joey Banks, a doctor who flies in from Montana to provide abortions at the clinic once a month.

Bianca, a 29-year-old from San Antonio, first learned about the Oklahoma laws after she found out she was too far along to get an abortion in Texas.

“It made me feel like I am just not in the loop,” she said. “Things are happening too quickly.”

Worried that Oklahoma would pass the law before she got to the clinic, Bianca took the first available appointment. On Sunday and Monday, she made the 18-hour round trip drive to Tulsa.

When she found out about Oklahoma, Bianca said, she couldn’t help wondering what state was next. If Oklahoma banned abortion, the receptionist told her she could try New Mexico.

“But if this whole law passes again in New Mexico, then what?” she said.

***

Two days after Bianca returned home from Tulsa, Oklahoma’s house committee on public health met to discuss the Texas-style abortion ban that could take effect immediately.

Only one lawmaker, Rep. Ajay Pittman (D), asked any questions about the bill.

“Can the health department or hospital association talk to the impact that this will have on patients?” she said.",Q2
https://www.jpost.com/judaism/article-708953,Non-gendered language for calling Jews to the Torah gets Conservative movement approval,"Five years ago, Rabbi Guy Austrian made a small but powerful change at the synagogue he leads: He wrote down the language his community used to call non-binary members to the Torah.

That language had been developed informally over time through a process that Austrian recalled as being “a little awkward” because it involved tweaking language on the fly for congregants whose gender did not fit into the male-female binary that’s baked into Hebrew.

Codifying the language meant changing only a few words of a formula in use in synagogues around the world, but it was essential to including people who are non-binary or otherwise do not identify as a man or woman, Austrian said.

“That makes the honor feel like an honor for the person who’s being called up for the Torah and for the congregation,” Rabbi Guy Austrian

Now, Austrian —rabbi of the Fort Tryon Jewish Center in Upper Manhattan — is one of three authors of a religious opinion approved last week by the law committee of the Conservative movement that officially endorses gender-neutral language for Torah honors. A delegation of Persian Jews and their friends marched at the Los Angeles Pride Parade in 2019. (credit: ANNA FALZETTA)

The opinion, called a teshuva, prescribes non-gendered language for three different honors, including the aliyah (the blessing before and after the Torah reading), hagbah (lifting the Torah) and gelilah (rolling up the Torah). It also includes procedures for calling up Cohens (descendants of the priests of the First Temple) and Levis (descendants of the tribe of Levi) as well as how to address people during the prayer for healing, known as Mi Shebeirach, without using gendered language.

According to the new teshuva, for example, a non-binary person who is called up for an aliyah, instead of being referred to as “ben” (son) or “bat” (daughter), is referred to as “m’beit” or “l’veit,” meaning “from the house of” their parents. The opinion notes that this construct has precedent in ketubahs — Jewish marriage contracts — and in the Hebrew vernacular.

The teshuva only affects rabbis and synagogues that are part of the Conservative movement, which claims about 26 percent of US Jewish adults who identify with a denomination, and even there it’s not determinative: Some have already been using the language, and the approval does not require anyone to start.

Still, it reflects a notable change at a time when people who are gender non-comforming, including non-binary or transgender, are facing fierce opposition, especially from Republican lawmakers who have made 2022 a record year for anti-LGBTQ legislation nationwide.

“For those who are looking for an elegant and efficient solution and want to be able to have an inclusive community that honors people of all genders, this offers useful guidance,” Rabbi Guy Austrian

The authors of the opinion — along with Austrian, Rabbi Robert Scheinberg of the United Synagogue of Hoboken, New Jersey and Rabbi Deborah Silver of Shir Chadash in Metairie, Louisiana — say that in addition to drawing from Fort Tryon Jewish Center, they consulted variations of liturgy from LGBTQ synagogues such as Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York City and Congregation Sha’ar Zahav in San Francisco; Jewish organizations such as Keshet and TransTorah that focus on LGBTQ inclusion, and individuals who are trans or non-binary.

The writers also note that they may not be the ideal authors of guidelines about how to mesh a contemporary understanding of gender with traditional Jewish law, because they themselves do not identify as non-binary.

“It’s just important to remember that this is an evolving terrain, both in society at large and within Jewish communities,” Austrian said. “So we don’t think that this teshuva is the last word. And we hope that as there are more non-binary, queer and transgender rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly that they’ll be the ones who who write the teshuvot that will come.”

Queerness in halacha

A diverse set of Jewish thinkers and clergy are already reshaping the role of gender in religious experience. In recent years, gender-neutral terms for traditional Jewish customs, such as the “b-mitzvah” in place of bar or bat mitzvah, have gained popularity. The Trans Halakha Project, which creates Jewish legal practices, customs and resources for trans Jews, launched just last year, an initiative of Svara, a Jewish learning group catering to queer Jews.

The new teshuva is a codification of a practice that has already existed in spaces led by trans and non-binary Jews, said Laynie Soloman, a non-binary rabbi and one of the co-founders of the Trans Halakha Project.

“I think it’s essential for halacha to be shaped by the people who it is about,” Solomon explained, referring to the disability activist community’s use of the phrase “nothing about us without us.”

Soloman, who consulted on both the new Conservative teshuva and on the original liturgy from Fort Tryon Jewish Center, said, “We’re seeing the codification of minhag— of real custom and ritual that has been shaped by trans and non-binary folks. So while in the end, this happens to be written down by folks who are not trans or non-binary, this work was created by trans and non-binary folks. And that’s what’s so powerful to me about it.”

Linguistic development for gender inclusivity

Meanwhile, people in both the United States and Israel have worked on creating a non-gendered version of Hebrew, a language in which nouns, adjectives and even verb conjugations carry masculine and feminine forms. One of them, Lior Gross, devised a way for non-binary people to speak Hebrew in part because they had trouble imagining being called to the Torah using the traditional, gendered script.

Like the other initiatives, the Conservative movement’s opinion represents an important development in inclusion in Jewish life, said Joshua Raclaw, an associate professor of linguistics at West Chester University in Pennsylvania who is non-binary and focuses on gender and sexuality in language.

Raclaw noted that gender non-conformity is embedded in Jewish tradition from its very inception. In the Book of Genesis, Adam is referred to as both “it” and “them,” even in the same sentence, he pointed out, adding that one 2nd-century rabbi specifically called Adam an “androgyne,” a term referring to a person with both masculine and feminine characteristics.

“While both Biblical and Modern Hebrew feature a grammatical gender binary, this tells us nothing about the genders that might exist among Hebrew speakers,” Raclaw said.

As Twitchy has reported, there’s a lot of butthurt about a judge striking down the CDC’s mask mandate on airplanes and other forms of public transportation. United thinks it’s “cool if a few kids die” so that passengers and flight attendants don’t have to wear masks anymore, according to one ER doctor. These kids are going to die because there’s no vaccine yet approved for children under 5, so flying on a plane is a death wish.

As we mentioned in an earlier post, Nate Silver noted that the average American spends about five hours a year on a plane, so the lifting of the mask mandate isn’t likely to make a major difference.

Blue check Jonathan Eisen has a great analogy to prove Silver wrong. The average American spends less than five hours a year in surgery, too, so why not drop the mask mandate for surgeons?

They found a woman's body.,"PRINCE GEORGE COUNTY, Va. — The man shot and killed by police in Prince George County, Virginia on Wednesday had his wife's dead body on his property, according to investigators.

When police went to 42-year-old Derrick G. Avey's Newburg, Pennsylvania home to tell next-of-kin about the fatal shooting, they found the body of 41-year-old Kyline C. Avey in the woods near the Pennsylvania home. She'd been shot multiple time, police said.

At one point the Aveys were married, but it was unclear if they were still married at the time of their deaths.

A Hopewell Sheriff's Deputy got into a ""slow-speed pursuit"" with Derrick Avey and his 2016 Ford Explorer at about 12:28 p.m. Wednesday.

Investigators have not yet said why law enforcement began that pursuit.

As the vehicle neared the intersection of Temple Avenue and River Road, near the Prince George/Hopewell line, ""the Explorer pulled up nose-to-nose with the police vehicles and [Avey] confronted the officers with a firearm,"" according to Virginia State Police spokesperson Sgt. Jessica Shehan.

Hopewell Police Officers and an ATF Special Agent shot and killed Avey.

No one else was hurt.

""During the course of notifying Avey's next of kin, the Pennsylvania State Police discovered a deceased female at Avey's residence,"" Shehan wrote. ""The Pennsylvania State Police is conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the woman's death.""

WASHINGTON: Hund­re­­ds of people protested outside the Pakistan Embassy on Tuesday, chanting slogans against Imran Khan’s ouster and demanding his return, and all of them were not PTI workers.

Many in the crowd — and the speakers — were among those who had been guests at the embassy’s Pakistan Day function on March 23. For them, it was the first event in which they were on the other side of the fence.

“Only Imran, no one else,” said one of the placards displayed at the protest. “No to looters,” read another. “Thie­ves and looters will run away. The honest will return,” proclaimed an Urdu placard.

A PTI worker had one of Imran’s quotes printed on his shirt: “Don’t lose heart. Be strong.” Two teenage girls carried placards, declaring: “Beggars cannot be leaders. Never mess with my country.”

Two other teenage girls, Unzela Khwaja and Zainab Nadeem, came from Elkridge, Maryland, on their own. “I came because my mom got really upset when she heard the news of Imran’s ouster,” said Unzela. “I want to share her grief.”

Zainab said she was “upset with the system in Pakistan” and wanted to “show her anger.”

Homemakers Farzana Khalid and Shaista Ali Khan came from Kingstown and Woodbridge, Virginia with the family. “Enough interference,” Farzana said. “We are not slaves of the Sharif family. Nawaz, Shehbaz, Mar­y­­am, Hamza, Junaid, is it a musical chair?”

“Yes, we want to be free of this stranglehold,” said Shaista. “We cannot remain their obedient servants forever.”

All of these women clai­m­­ed they were not PTI workers and had never participated in activities like this before.

Dr Aftab Hussain, a senior PTI worker, described this as “a defining moment.” He said he believed Imran’s claim that a US official had sent threats to Pakistan. “This is interference in a country’s internal matters.”

The slogans chanted at the rally were more targeted than speeches and comments. The most popular slogans, however, focused on Maulana Fazlur Rehman who, many among the protesters believed, was the instigator of the campaign that brought Imran down.

“Diesel, diesel,” was tur­ned into a chant as the participants kept the beat with their feet.

“We had a man who could restore honesty and free the society of corruption. They forced him out. Shame, shame,” said Johnny Bashir, a local PTI leader.

Khalid Ahmed, a PTI member from Virginia, urged people to “stay united and continue the campaign till Imran Khan returns.”

Rana Saadat, another PTI leader, called for early elections and urged the participants to spread this message among their friends and relatives in Pakistan. “Let’s bring PTI back in power with a two-thirds majority,” he said.

Renters who don't have a “history of positive reviews on Airbnb” will be barred from making one-night reservations for houses, and there will also be limits on who can make two-night bookings, the company said.

Airbnb said it will require renters to confirm that they understand the company's ban on parties and that Airbnb could take legal action against violators.

The company said guests who have received positive marks in the past won't be affected by the changes.

San Francisco-based Airbnb said similar measures prevented 126,000 people from renting properties over the July 4 holiday last year because they lacked positive reviews from hosts.

Airbnb has long faced criticism over large parties, some of which have turned violent, at properties listed by its hosts.

Last month, two teens were killed and several others injured by gunfire during an Easter weekend party at an Airbnb in Pittsburgh.

On Tuesday, law enforcement officials announced they’d solved the case.

Indiana State Police, alongside several federal and local agencies, identified Harry Edward Greenwell, who is now deceased, as the killer responsible for the rapes and murders of Vicki Heath, Margaret “Peggy” Gill and Jeanne Gilbert. Investigators have also linked him through DNA analysis to a sexual assault of a woman in 1990 in Columbus, Indiana. The women worked as clerks in motels along the I-65 corridor.

Greenwell died of cancer in Iowa in 2013 at age 68.

""There are detectives in this very room that have been involved in this in some form or another for literally generations,"" said Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter. ""I hope today might bring a little bit of solace to know that the animal who did this is no longer on this Earth.""

FOR SUBSCRIBERS:

Tuesday's announcement brings an end to the cold cases of the women's assaults and killings. Police noted, however, there's a ""distinct possibility"" Greenwell could be linked to more unsolved cases. Sgt. Glen Fifield of the Indiana State Police said detectives are continuing to investigate whether Greenwell, who was born in Kentucky, is connected to other violent crime in the Midwest.

Gilbert's daughter, Kim Wright, said the families may never know why their relatives suffered the horrific fate, but the revealing of the killer's identity provided some consolation.

""I'd like to believe that whatever each of us defines as justice, or what each of us might define as closure, that we're all now able to share the healing process knowing the long known attacker has now been brought out of the dark, into the light,"" Wright, an attorney, said.

The announcement of the Days Inn killer's identity bookends an investigation that’s spanned more than 30 years. The search for the killer began in 1987 when Heath, 41, was found assaulted and shot to death behind a Super 8 motel in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.

In 1989, two more women fell victim to the killer.

Gill, a 24-year-old overnight auditor at a Days Inn in Merrillville, was sexually assaulted and killed in the early morning hours of March 3.

An eerily similar attack occurred at another Days Inn dozens of miles away on the same night. Gilbert, a part-time auditor for the Remington motel, was assaulted. A motorist saw the 34-year-old's body on the side of the road in White County. Police said both women were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun.

Police said DNA collected at the scene of Heath’s killing linked to Gilbert's death.

DNA also linked the same attacker behind a 1990 sexual assault of a clerk at a Days Inn in Columbus, Indiana. In that case, the clerk got away and was able to vividly describe the attacker, which led to the police sketch of the suspect that circulated widely.

Police on Tuesday said a DNA match to Greenwell was made through a close family member, and returned a 99.99% probability.

Greenwell's criminal history was detailed in a handout given to reporters by police. In 1963, he was sentenced to two years in the reformatory and five years probation for an armed robbery in Kentucky. Two years later, police arrested him on a sodomy charge. Greenwell was paroled in 1969 from the Kentucky State Penitentiary.

He served a prison sentence in Iowa for burglary. Police said he escaped, and was captured, twice. The prison released him in 1983.

Five years later, the investigation into the Days Inn killer began.

Police credited the ""investigative genealogy"" for the major breakthrough in the case. They said major improvements to DNA technology throughout the years aided their ability to utilize the method.

""I just hope that the effort this group has put in will somehow bring long, overdue closure to the family and friends of not just Miss Heath, but all the victims that are represented,"" said David Fegett, deputy chief of operations of the Elizabethtown police department.

The victims

The case of the Days Inn killer began with Heath’s horrific killing.

In February 1987, customers at the Super 8 Motel found no one at the front desk. The lobby was torn apart. The prospective patrons called the police to investigate the strange scene.

Police made the grisly discovery near a trash bin at the back of the motel. Heath had been assaulted and shot twice in the head.

The bloody crime rocked the town of Elizabethtown, Kentucky.

Two years later, the killer executed gruesomely familiar attacks on the same night.

Gill, a 24-year-old night auditor at the Days Inn in Merrillville, was attacked and killed in the wee hours of March 3, 1989.

Roughly 50 miles south, another Days Inn clerk suffered the same fate.

Gilbert, a part-time auditor at the Days Inn in Remington, was found shot to death on the side of the road by a motorist driving through White County.

Only in the women’s final hours did Gill and Gilbert’s paths cross, as the Indianapolis Star said in a 1989 article. Police determined they were killed by bullets from the same gun. Both motels had been robbed. In total, the killer swiped $426.

Gilbert was a working mother taking business courses at St. Joseph’s College, an Indianapolis Star article reported. Gill loved to bake, paint and cross stitch. She worked her way up from being a maid at the motel to an auditor position.

Gill’s family displayed some of her cross-stitch pieces at her funeral, the article said, including one depicting the Last Supper, next to her coffin.

The women's families told the Indianapolis Star months after the killings that they were still coping with the deaths – but not forgetting.

Gill’s parents at the time said they don’t speak about revenge – just uncertainty. Her mother called the lack of a suspect at the time a “mixed blessing.”

“In some ways, it’s peace not to have to look at someone. But you read about something else and you wonder ‘was that him, too?’” Anna Gill said at the time.

Decades later, Wright told reporters that she also feels peace. While she, and the other families, may never be able to answer some questions about their loved one's final moments, she finds peace in Gilbert's memory.

She remembers her mother's last words to her and her brother — specifically how Gilbert said she loved them and would see them ""tomorrow.""

""I didn't see her that tomorrow,"" she said. ""But I see her every day. I see her in me. I see her in my brother. I see her in my family.""

Employers should also be aware that the County of Los Angeles has some separate local ordinances that apply only to unincorporated areas of the county and do not apply to the City of Los Angeles.

Here is an overview of some of the ordinances which apply to employers with employees working within the City of Los Angeles.

Minimum Wage

Los Angeles is one of the many cities in the state with its own citywide minimum wage ordinance. As with many of the local minimum wage ordinances, Los Angeles’s minimum wage is expected to increase on July 1, 2022.

Starting July 1, 2022, the City of Los Angeles’s minimum wage for employers of all sizes will be $16.04.

Hotel Worker Minimum Wage & Leave

The City of Los Angeles also has a separate minimum wage ordinance for hotel employers with 150 or more guest rooms within the city. Starting July 1, 2022, that minimum wage will be $18.17.

The minimum wage ordinance for hotel employers with 150 or more guest rooms also includes requirements for compensated and uncompensated time off. This is similar to the ordinance recently passed in West Hollywood. Under the ordinance, covered full-time employees are entitled to 96, compensated hours, off per year for sick leave, vacation, or personal necessity. Covered full-time employees are entitled to 80 additional, uncompensated hours, off per year to use for sick leave.

Paid Sick Leave

The City of Los Angeles also has its own paid sick leave requirements separate from the statewide paid sick leave statute. Los Angeles’s citywide paid sick leave requirements are as follows:

Front-Loading At least 48 hours provided either at the beginning of each year of employment, calendar year, or 12-month period; OR – Accrual One (1) hour of paid sick leave for every thirty (30) hours worked. 72-Hour Cap Accrued, unused paid sick leave shall carry over to the following year of employment and may be capped at a minimum of 72 hours; however, an employer may choose no cap or a higher cap. Separation from Employment An employer is not required to provide compensation to an employee for accrued or unused sick days at separation from employment. Reinstatement If an employee is re-hired within one (1) year of separation from employment, previously accrued and unused paid sick leave shall be reinstated. When to Use An employee may use paid sick leave beginning the 90th day of employment. Reason for Leave Employees may take time off for themselves or to care for a family member. Cap on Annual Time The use of paid sick leave may be limited to 48 hours of leave, annually.

Fair Chance Initiative

The City of Los Angeles has a “ban the box” ordinance similar to the statewide Fair Chance Act.

The ordinance applies to employers with at least 10 employees in the City of Los Angeles, with certain exceptions such as employers who are required by law to obtain information regarding a conviction of an applicant.

Under Los Angeles’s ordinance, covered employers must inform applicants that qualified individuals with criminal histories will be considered. Moreover, employers may not inquire into an applicant’s criminal history after a conditional offer of employment has been made.

Los Angeles has additional information on its “ban the box” ordinance available on its Bureau of Contract Administration website.",Q2

And what better teachers than people who know what it’s like to be bullied and called names?

Students from the Willmar Public Schools’ Focus House program have spoken in each of the Kennedy fourth-grade classrooms in recent weeks, teaching students about ways they can advocate for themselves and others.

The exercise was part of an Ambassadors for Respect presentation in Lisa Devine's fourth-grade classroom at Kennedy Elementary School on Thursday, May 5, 2022. Macy Moore / West Central Tribune

Focus House is a program for students with special needs who have graduated from high school. It helps people with a variety of disabilities learn skills they’ll need to live on their own in the community. Participants have paying jobs and learn how to budget, pay bills, cook and clean.

In a recent presentation for teacher Lisa Devine's class, five presenters from Focus House wore T-shirts that said, “Ambassadors for Respect,” and offered the fourth-graders a list of three things they could do to battle bullying:



Include others. Invite a child sitting alone to have lunch with you or play with you.

The group used a PowerPoint digital slide presentation, videos and activities to get their message across to the fourth-graders.

The Ambassadors for Respect program is a project of the 50-year-old Minnesota Governor’s Council on Developmental Disabilities. Its goal is to develop partnerships to combat bullying in communities.

The Focus House group told the fourth-graders that people are more alike than different, and they shared a little of their own stories.

Hana Mahamud, 18, who has cerebral palsy, said she was bullied for her religion and for her disability when she was younger. “Kids would call me stupid and say I’m not smart, which is not true,” she said.

When she was in ninth grade, her family moved to Willmar, and she was bullied less in a smaller community.

“If any of you have bullied others, please stop,” she said. “It’s a bad thing.”

Quinn Hogan, 21, told his story through a series of signs he held up in a video, asking for patience, saying, “communicating takes my brain a little bit longer.” Everyone has things to say, even if they can’t say them, he said.

Fourth-graders were asked to think of hurtful words they’d been called or maybe said to someone else by mistake. “We’re not going to tell anybody,” said Focus House teacher Suzanne Moyers. “Your teacher’s not going to know; no one’s going to know.”

After writing the words down, they were invited to bring them to a shredder, manned by Hogan.

Asked afterward how the shredding felt, the class came up with ""satisfied,"" ""happy,"" ""excited,"" ""good,"" ""epic,"" ""awesome"" and ""amazing.""

“Language is powerful,” said Riana Halvorson, 20. “Words matter, and we use words to be kind.” She said the people from Focus House don't want other kids to feel they way they have in the past.

The whole group talked about ways kids could advocate for themselves or for other people.

“It’s OK to ask for help,” said Nimo Moge, 18.

Suggestions included walking away, telling the person to stop, talking to a teacher, distracting the bully and being a friend or eating lunch with someone who’s alone.

They talked about random acts of kindness, too. The fourth-graders were asked to think of an act of kindness and write it on a yellow star they’d been given. The stars were hung on a long string in the classroom.

To close the presentation, students were asked to stand if they wanted to become ambassadors. They pledged, “As ambassadors I promise to include others, use person first language and advocate for myself and others.”

Moyers told them, “You are now superheroes.”

After the presentation, the Focus House group gathered to review what had been the second of five presentations.

The students had been nervous as they prepared to speak to the Kennedy students, Moyers said, “but I thought you guys did beautifully.”

Halvorson told Deqa Mohamed, 19, that she was proud of her and the work she had put in to be able to say ""advocacy,"" a word that had been difficult for her to say.

Most of them had done things they’d never done before in the presentations. This year they were in charge of running the PowerPoint presentation and talked in front of a live audience.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Even after two men were found dead in his California apartment, Ed Buck did not stop injecting gay men with walloping doses of methamphetamine.

A federal judge on Thursday sentenced him to 30 years in prison in the deaths of Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean. Another man, Dane Brown, was repeatedly injected by Buck but survived and his harrowing account of being revived twice finally led to Buck’s arrest in 2019.

Buck, 67, a big dollar donor to Democratic, LGBTQ and animal rights causes, appeared in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for providing fatal doses of drugs, operating a drug den and enticing men to travel for prostitution. He was convicted last summer.

Judge Christina A. Snyder said the sentencing decision was difficult because she had to balance the good Buck did in his life with the “horrific crimes” that she called “more than just an accident.”

Prosecutors asked for a life sentence, saying that they couldn't take the risk that Buck might be released and that he has shown he is capable of re-offending.

But Buck's defense attorneys sought a decade behind bars — below the federal sentencing guidelines — saying he was sexually abused as a child and health problems led to his drug addiction.

Federal prosecutors said Buck's unrelenting fervor to satisfy a fetish by preying on vulnerable men, often young and Black, is reason enough to keep him behind bars for the rest of his life. Buck's attorneys said any sentence of more than 25 years would essentially mean a life sentence because he is 67.

Buck told the judge on Thursday that he had loved the men and said he wished he could have turned back time but insisted he was not responsible.

“Their deaths were tragic but I did not cause their deaths,” Buck said.

“Buck used his money and privilege to exploit the wealth and power imbalances between himself and his victims, who were unhoused, destitute, and/or struggling with addiction,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Chelsea Norell said in a court filing. “He spent thousands of dollars on drugs and party and play sessions that destroyed lives and bred insidious addictions.”

Norell objected to the 30-year sentence, saying anything below 40 years in prison did not account for the severity of Buck's crimes.

Defense lawyers asked the judge to be more lenient because Buck was sexually abused as a child and developed his drug addiction as the result of a medical condition.

Attorneys Mark Werksman and Elizabeth Little said the judge should go below the 25-year sentence recommended by probation officials that would allow rehabilitation and treatment and “would be much preferable to relegating him to death in prison.”

Probation officials also recommended a $1 million fine, though prosecutors said it should be $400,000 to leave money for lawsuits filed by the families of his survivors.

Buck, a wealthy white man who worked as a male model and then made a small fortune selling an Arizona company he rescued from bankruptcy, helped lead a 1987 campaign to recall Republican Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham, who was ultimately convicted in an impeachment trial and kicked out of office.

Buck retired at 32 to the city of West Hollywood, known for its large LGBTQ community, where he lived in a rent-controlled apartment and donated over $500,000 to mostly Democratic causes since 2000.

His troubles began when Gemmel Moore was found dead in his apartment on July 27, 2017. Buck had flown Moore from Texas that morning for drug use and he was dead by sunset.

Moore's mother, LaTisha Nixon, said in a letter to the court that she hoped Buck would get the maximum term for ruining her life and the hurt it has caused her family. Nixon, a certified nursing assistant, said she could not comfort her son the way she has for countless dying people.

“All I can think about is how my son died naked on a mattress with no love around him,” Nixon said. “No one to hold his hand or tell him good things.”

Community members and activists rallied outside Buck's apartment, calling for his arrest, but he remained free. Family members and Jasmyne Cannick, a political strategist, complained that Buck escaped prosecution because of wealth, political ties and race.

While he was under investigation in Moore's death, Buck continued to pay men so he could inject them. He texted one man, Timothy Dean, to express his annoyance over the investigation.

About 18 months after Moore's death, deputies were called to Buck's apartment on Jan. 7, 2019, to investigate Dean's death.

Even after Dean's death, Buck was not arrested.

“Buck’s lack of remorse is aptly captured in one image: As he was hiding out in a hotel, evading arrest for Gemmel Moore’s death, he was injecting Dane Brown, another young Black man, with back-to-back slams of methamphetamine,"" Norell said.

Brown was homeless and later moved into Buck's apartment, where he was injected with meth most days and often several times a day.

He was hospitalized Sept. 4, 2019, after Buck shot him up three times with back-to-back doses. He had five times the meth in his system that Moore and Dean had when they died, prosecutors said.

Brown returned less than a week later and felt himself overdosing after Buck injected him three times with meth. Like other victims who testified against Buck at trial last summer, Brown was nearly immobilized. He said Buck wouldn't help him.

“Brown sat on the couch, resigned to the same fate as Moore and Dean, when he heard his deceased mother cry out to him, ‘Get up, Dane,’” Norell said.

Brown managed to get out of the apartment and made it to a nearby gas station, where he called for help and was taken to a hospital.",Q2

U.S. troops will be repositioned from elsewhere in Africa to train and provide other support to Somali forces in their fight against al-Shabab, which is considered the largest and wealthiest affiliate of the al-Qaida extremist organization.

It’s a reminder that the U.S. remains engaged in the long fight against Islamic extremists around the world even if that fight has been eclipsed by the war in Ukraine and other matters.

The decision to station forces again in Somalia, rather than rotate them in and out, is intended “to maximize the safety and effectiveness of our forces and enable them to provide more efficient support to our partners,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in announcing the redeployment.

People look at destroyed shops in Mogadishu’s Lido beach, Somalia, April, 23, 2022, after a bomb blast by Somalia’s Islamic extremist rebels hit a popular seaside restaurant killing at least six people.

U.S. forces in Somalia will total “under 500? and are not being sent to engage in direct combat, according to a senior Biden administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to brief journalists on the rationale behind the decision.

Instead, the troops will work with Somali forces and provide security to personnel from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development as they work with the government to emerge from years of turmoil, the official said.

Trump abruptly ordered the withdrawal of approximately 700 troops from Somalia at the end of his term in January 2021, an extension of a broader policy of seeking to pull the U.S. out of what he derisively referred to as “endless wars” around the world.

But military leaders said that came at a cost, wasting time, money and momentum as troops had to rotate in and out of the country.

Gen. Stephen Townsend, head of U.S. Africa Command, told Congress in March that the rotations, which he called “commuting to work,” were not efficient or effective and put American troops at greater risk.

“In my view, we are marching in place at best. We may be backsliding,” Townsend told the Senate Armed Forces Committee.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin requested the deployment “to reestablish a persistent U.S. military presence in Somalia to enable a more effective fight against al-Shabaab, which has increased in strength and poses a heightened threat,” said an administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan before the White House announcement.

Biden’s decision to sign the order was first reported by The New York Times, which also said the the president had a approved a Pentagon request for standing authority to target about a dozen suspected leaders of al-Shabab.

The rebel group has made territorial gains against Somalia’s federal government in recent months, reversing the gains of African Union peacekeepers who once had pushed the militants into remote areas of the country.

Word of the deployment decision came after Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who served as Somalia’s president between 2012 and 2017, was announced on Sunday as the winner of a protracted election.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/17/joe-biden-struggles-to-take-action-on-us-police-reform,Joe Biden struggles to take action on US police reform,"With Congress stalemated, the White House is stuck between reform advocates and police unions who are far apart on policies.

After more than a year in office, President Joe Biden has not yet delivered on long-promised police reforms in the United States, leaving Black civil rights advocates and community activists disappointed.

Biden’s campaign trail promise to deliver reforms came amid widespread protests in the summer of 2020 in the wake of the killings of Black Americans George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of mainly white police officers.

“Watch what I do. Judge me based on what I do, what I say and to whom I say it,” Biden told a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) town hall meeting in June 2020 as he sought the White House.

A month earlier, Floyd had been killed by a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck while three other officers looked on, sparking worldwide demonstrations against police abuses. Biden, who was courting the Black vote, voiced support for the protesters and was elected president in November.

Since then, Black Lives Matter activists and other US civil rights groups have been asking the president to take several steps including holding officers who kill people accountable in court, establishing a national database of police killings and reimagining approaches to public safety.

The second anniversary of Floyd’s murder is May 25, an anniversary that might spur action.

Reform advocates further want to see an end to the militarisation of police through the transfer of government weapons and equipment, removal of police from schools and parks, and a reinvestment in communities of colour.

The White House had hoped that Congress would pass legislation that Biden could sign into law. An expansive bill bearing Floyd’s name addressed many of the reforms advocates were calling for.

Introduced in February 2021, soon after Biden took office and backed by Democrats, it passed a House vote on party lines, but has been blocked by Republicans in the Senate.

Late last year, White House policy director Susan Rice held a series of conference calls with civil rights and law enforcement organisations seeking input and sharing the administration’s thinking on issues.

In January, the White House signalled Biden would soon sign an executive order to push through police reforms, though changes he could make are limited without congressional backing.

The executive order has been shelved since then after police and Republican politicians objected strongly.

Recent killings by police of Patrick Lyoya in Michigan and Amir Locke in Minnesota, both Black men, have brought the issue back to the fore.

“The killing of Mr Lyoya underscores the continuing and urgent need to fundamentally rethink the approach to public safety in our country,” the NAACP said in a statement. Lyoya was shot in the back of the head by an officer after a traffic stop led to a foot chase and struggle.

Biden’s “intention is absolutely to sign a policing executive order”, then White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on April 13, but offered no timeline.

Biden’s draft order, leaked in January and widely circulated, would have set national accreditation standards for police departments and opened a national database of “bad cops” – officers who had been tagged for misconduct, police and civil rights groups said.

Reform advocates applauded the move towards standard setting and data collection, but have continued to call for more far-reaching reforms like ending qualified immunity – which protects police officers from being sued -, increasing criminal prosecutions of police who abuse citizens’ rights and ending dangerous “no-knock” raids

“Although really good on a symbolic level and really good on certain very specific levels, it doesn’t achieve the kind of change that communities need,” Arthur Ago, director at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said of the prospective executive order.

“The president’s power is very limited. He cannot implement some of the changes that people really want to see,” said Scott Roberts, senior director at Color of Change, an advocacy network.

Presidential limitations

Without Congress, Biden can not limit qualified immunity that in many instances shields police officers from civil lawsuits brought by victims of police misconduct.

Police groups have warned changing qualified immunity would have a chilling effect on aggressive policing.

Reform advocates also want a change in US law to allow more federal prosecutions of officers who kill or abuse people while violating their civil rights, like the four officers involved in Floyd’s death.

Biden can only encourage the Justice Department to explore civil rights prosecutions against police “more thoroughly”, Ago said.

Biden’s hands are also tied in ending so-called “no-knock” raids by state and local police like the one that killed Amir Locke in Minneapolis on February 2.

Locke, 22 years old, was asleep on a couch when armed police opened the door without knocking and then shot him in an early morning raid when they saw a gun in his hand. Locke, who was roused from sleep, had a permit to carry the weapon. Minnesota prosecutors decided not to charge the officer who fired at Locke.

“It did create a bad scenario. But under the existing law, probably nearly impossible to get a conviction,” said David Schultz, a professor of politics at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Biden pivots

In his State of the Union address to Congress in March, Biden rejected calls to defund the police – a rallying cry of the 2020 protests – and instead called on lawmakers to provide more funding for police. That left reform advocates disappointed.

“I don’t think that the majority of the Democratic Party ever had their hearts in police reform,” said Melina Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter organiser in Los Angeles who participated in calls with Rice and civil rights groups in October.

“They were pressured into speaking in those terms by hundreds of thousands and even millions of folks being in the streets. But many of them are really beholden to these old models and to police associations themselves,” Abdullah told Al Jazeera.

Abdullah and others said they still are hopeful Biden will sign an executive order implementing reforms before May 25, the second anniversary of Floyd’s death, but expectations for what it will do are low.",Q2

(ANGELA WEISS/AFP/MANILA BULLETIN)

Consul General of the Philippine Consulate General in New York Elmer Cato cited the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in his tweet that tagged the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.

“The New York City Police Department has just informed @PHinNewYork that there are no Filipinos among the at least 29 people who were reported injured in the mass shooting on the N train in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning. @DFAPHL @teddyboylocsin,” he wrote.

The suspect, identified as Frank James, 62, was already arrested without incident by patrol officers in Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood a day after the shooting incident in a New York subway car that has just pulled into an underground station in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood.

James was suspected of setting off smoke grenades and firing a handgun 33 times in a crowded N train during the morning rush hour.

The attack left 29 people injured, including 10 who were shot.

The motive of the attack was not yet known, but James will possibly be charged in federal court with violating a law that prohibits terrorist and other violent attacks against a mass transportation system.

For fifty years, the abortion movement has revolved around the myth that it safeguards women’s health. For this reason, abortion is expressed in terms of women’s bodies with cries of “my body, my choice.” Men need not opine.

Suddenly, a strange new crack has appeared in the abortion movement that disputes this narrative. Medical organizations, advocacy groups and leftist politicians are changing the rhetoric. They no longer use the word ‘woman’ in the abortion debate. The movement has gone woke and is leaving behind feminists who now represent yesterday’s revolution.

A stab in the back

The New York Times writer Michael Powell quoted a pro-abortion tweet by the American Civil Liberties Union that sounded the alarm about the threat of overturning the Roe decision. The tweet failed to mention the only demographic biologically able to have an abortion. It reads:

“Abortion bans disproportionately harm: Black Indigenous and other people of color. The L.G.B.T.Q. community. Immigrants. Young people. Those working to make ends meet. People with disabilities. Protecting abortion access is an urgent matter of racial and economic justice.”

The message of the tweet is clear. The abortion movement is now so fused with the avant-garde of today’s woke revolution that it cannot be separated from all identity groups. Leftist theory is now so mainstream that the affirmation that a person is a woman cannot be tolerated, as everyone must be forced into a bizarre non-binary world. The supposed cause of the abortion fight – oppressed women—is now left out, which leads to the suspicion that it never was the cause in the first place.

Even Planned Parenthood and N.A.R.A.L. Pro-Choice America, that have long written the script in the abortion debate, are avoiding the w-word. They may hold women’s marches here and there to impress their grassroots. They will still talk about woman’s choice referring to a past talking point. However, behind the backs of the activists, they are betraying feminists. Pro-abortion literature increasingly employs terms like “pregnant people” and “birthing people” to indicate women who are expecting children.

What is a woman?

It’s not about women anymore. The long decades spent developing women’s studies departments and feminist literature are over. They are passé and even reactionary. The new struggle revolves around “gender”-neutral language that reflects the belief that a person’s sex is a social construct and self-determined.

To affirm the existence of a man or woman must be rejected altogether. Indeed, not even Supreme Court Justice-designate Ketanji Brown Jackson would answer the question: What is a woman?” lest she stray off the woke path.

In the case of abortion, there can be no distinctions between women and “transgendered” men since both can become “birthing persons” and have abortions. The new abortion activism reflects this sea change without women.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Amid protests from Florida House Democrats on the chamber floor Thursday in Tallahassee, Republican lawmakers rushed to approve both a new congressional map and a bill to eliminate a handful of special tax districts, including one affecting Walt Disney World.

Both special session bills were set to be discussed in the GOP-majority House, but discussions came to a head during an ""informal recess.""

Politico Florida Bureau Chief Matt Dixon was the first to note the sit-in of sorts by Democratic representatives where photos and videos on social media showed them gathering on the chamber floor holding signs, chanting and giving speeches.

""Draw some constitutional maps. Those are our demands and we will not be moved,"" one representative could be heard saying.

Does not seem like House Democrats plan on ending sit in anytime soon.

Rep. Dianne Hart was among those who went live from the chamber floor, essentially interviewing other representatives about Thursday's events. In the video, Hart called the situation at hand ""insane"" as she walked around the chamber floor adding, ""We're here to stay.""

Hart also claimed Gov. Ron DeSantis' approach to the congressional maps is about: ""I want you to give me what I want.""

Rep. Anna Eskamani also went live from the floor, giving a behind-the-scenes look at Democrats' effort to take a stance ""against the Governor's unconstitutional maps that erase black representation.""

On Twitter, Rep. Carlos G. Smith called the protest and sit-in by House Democrats as being ""up to good and necessary trouble!""

Republican Rep. Spencer Roach commented on Twitter about the apparent protest, calling it an insurrection.

""House Democrats are staging an insurrection on the House floor to obstruct the democratic process. Shameful,"" he wrote.

""As is obvious, we have members who've decided they wanted to hijack our process today. It is my belief and your belief that no member of this chamber has the opportunity to shut down our process, to shut down a job that the people of the public and the people of Florida have asked us to do. We will be concluding our business today,"" Speaker Chris Sprowls said as all members reconvened.

Amid Sprowls comments yelling and chanting could be heard echoing through the chamber. Cheers erupted in conflict with the ""No's!"" being yelled from the back of the chamber as the congressional map bill passed.

Representatives on both sides of the aisle were in special session to sign off on the new congressional map that, if signed by Gov. DeSantis, would alter the districts of two Black U.S. House members — Reps. Al Lawson and Sheila Cherfilus McCormick.

Around Tampa Bay, at least two districts would be redrawn under the map the governor is expected to sign. It would expand District 12 and move some voters from District 13 in Pinellas County to District 14 in Hillsborough County.

This map is expected to give Republicans more Florida seats than the maps previously approved by the House and Senate during the regular legislative session.

Lawmakers also entered the special session to consider a bill to dissolve any independent special district established by a ""special act"" prior to the ratification of the Florida Constitution on Nov. 5, 1968, and has not been reestablished, re-ratified, or reconstituted since.

If signed into law, said independent special districts would be dissolved by June 1, 2023. Any independent special district dissolved would be the ability to be reestablished at a later date ""pursuant to the requirements and limitations of this chapter.""",Q2

The Washington Post first reported Friday on a move that adds new detail to the pressure campaign by national conservative figures and Arizona residents on state and local officials to avert Trump's narrow defeat.

Ginni Thomas' activism in the upper echelons of the conservative movement in Washington has raised cries for Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from some cases and for the adoption of clear ethics rules for the high court.

Her Arizona outreach came in a pair of emails to Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, and state Rep. Shawnna Bolick, R-Phoenix, who was part of the committee overseeing elections, the Post reported.

Bowers did not respond to Thomas' message, according to records obtained Friday by The Arizona Republic.

Bolick, who is married to Arizona Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, conveyed a personal relationship with the Thomases and told her how to file a formal complaint.

A spokesperson for Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich did not immediately say whether Thomas filed a formal complaint alleging fraud.

Thomas has been a strong supporter of Trump and her outreach came just after media organizations had called Arizona for President Joe Biden in what proved to be the closest race in the country. She didn't mention any candidate by name, but given Biden's apparent victory at the time, the messages unmistakably urged a different result.

“Article II of the United States Constitution gives you an awesome responsibility: to choose our state’s Electors,” Thomas wrote in a Nov. 9 email, the Post said. Please “take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen.”

Who is Ginni Thomas?:What to know about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' wife

She told the lawmakers to “stand strong in the face of political and media pressure” and said they had the “power to fight back against fraud.”

Neither Thomas, Bowers nor Bolick, were immediately available for comment.

The messages are a reminder of how quickly Trump supporters concluded widespread election fraud, even as ballots were still being officially counted, and the radical plan for GOP-controlled states to pick electors to override voter choices was already being pursued in high places.

U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., suggested in a text message to Mark Meadows, Trump's then-chief of staff, on Nov. 6 — three days after the election — that in ""states where there's been shenanigans"" he submit alternate electors for Trump and have Republican-led legislatures formally support him despite apparent losses with voters, according to CNN, which obtained Meadows' messages.

The Biggs message includes language like ""a look doors"" where Biggs may have intended to say ""electors.""

""I'm sure you have heard of this proposal,"" Biggs wrote. ""It is to encourage the state legislatures to appoint a look doors in the various states where there's been shenanigans. If I understand right most of those states have Republican Legislature's. It seems to be comport with glorified Bush as well as the Constitution. And, well highly controversial, it can't be much more controversial than the lunacy that were sitting out there now. And It would be pretty difficult because he would take governors and legislators with collective will and backbone to do that. Is anybody on the team researching and considering lobbying for that?""

""I love it,"" Meadows responded.

Thomas also was reportedly in touch with Meadows during this period.

Illegitimate alternate elector paperwork was submitted to Congress from seven states — including Arizona — as part of an effort intended to keep Trump in office.

https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/they-failed-me-father-speaks-out-after-children-allegedly-stabbed-to-death-by-mother,'They failed me': Father speaks out after children tragically murdered,"LEXINGTON, Ky. (LEX 18) — The estranged father of the two children police say were murdered by their mother, says the system failed them.

The last time Darryl Williams says he saw his children Deon and Skyler was almost two years ago.

""I got a story from the school, and they said Deon had to make a comic book up of superheroes. Be in mind, my son hadn't seen me in almost two years, and I still was his comic book hero,"" Williams said tearfully.

LEX 18 met with Williams at his home in Cincinnati, the city Deon and Skyler were born in. He says they moved away with their mother, Nikki James almost four years ago. Ever since then, Williams says it's been nothing short of a fight to see his children.

""Me just crying out to the system saying just listen to me I need help. Can I at least get to see my children,"" said Williams.

Williams says he'd initiated a petition with the Hamilton County Juvenile to get visitation rights and joint custody of Deon and Skyler. Documents from court reveal at one point there was a warrant for James' arrest for contempt of court because she didn't show up or follow through with visitation rights.

""She was in contempt several times for not letting me see my children but that was down here in Hamilton County. They were saying they couldn't go up there and get the kids. I had put in several things to Hamilton County to let them know that she was unstable, but I could not prove anything. They never had my back,"" said Williams.

Williams had precious memories with Deon, who he says he helped name and gave him his same initials.

He's struggling right now to process how he went from fighting to see the kids, to placing a call with police telling them he was concerned about their safety, to now planning their funeral.

""They failed me,"" said Williams. ""A lot of people tell me I'm strong. But it hurts.""

Williams and his partner were the ones to call 911 on Sunday night asking for a welfare check. It was just after James called them and claimed she was ""in a cult"" and was ""in fear of her life.""

Public records show police officers went to James's apartment after that call, arrived at 8:48 p.m., stayed for about an hour, and left. Officials say James stabbed them to death the next day.

""You had to sit there with her for an hour on Sunday, and then Monday she took the children's lives and hers, well tried to, what didn't y'all didn't see,"" said Williams.

Now Williams is trying to grapple with feeling like he and his kids were failed twice by the very system put in place to protect them.

""The world is very, very hard on men. And even more, so Black men trying to do the right thing. I understand they got their own preset perception of how they want to view us. But some of us know how to grow up when we grow up. And we do the right thing, and we still get pushed back and things like this happened because nobody else seen what I seen,"" said Williams.

After going to the funeral home to make arrangements for his children on Monday, he is understandably inconsolable because he was clinging to the hope that he would have more time.

""I'm not afraid to show this emotion. I just want this emotion to mean something and make a change,"" said Williams.

https://nj1015.com/more-blood-on-murphys-hands-in-latest-nj-bear-attack-opinion/,More blood on Murphy’s hands in latest NJ bear attack (Opinion),"I hate to say I told you so.

Please share this piece with Gov. Phil Murphy because he needs to hear it from you. He is going to kill someone.

It almost happened Wednesday. A 34-year-old woman walking along Gorney Road in Lafayette at 4:30 p.m. was confronted by a black bear. Without any known provocation, the bear charged her, attacked her, mauled her. It opened up wounds on her right arm and her right side.

Had it not been for the actions of a neighbor who saw the attack and drove his vehicle towards the bear with horn blaring, it’s a logical bet she could have been killed. This is officially considered an aggressive Category 1 encounter, which means if the bear is trapped by New Jersey Fish and Wildlife it will be euthanized.

Last winter in Sparta, about 5 miles away from this attack, there were two other bear attacks that killed two dogs and left an elderly woman with head and leg injuries.

In the summer of 2020, a man was left with 30 stitches after a bear attacked him inside his own garage.

This is not going to stop.

Not since Gov. Phil Murphy put an end to bear hunts in New Jersey as a way to control the bear population. He made this terribly misguided decision despite the overwhelming evidence offered by his own wildlife experts that a hunt was absolutely necessary and that other available humane solutions were ineffective and therefore not solutions at all.

Things are bound to get worse. This isn’t just my opinion. From Erin Vogt’s article on New Jersey 101.5:

""We predicted things like this happening when they shut the bear hunt down,” United Bowhunters of New Jersey president, John Erndl, said to New Jersey 101.5.

He said the bear population is “exploding” across the state and that more incidents are going to happen, if no further preventative actions are taken.

See, the problem is bears don’t care about politics or about a governor burnishing his progressive credentials for a White House bid. What they care about is survival. They care about eating. They care about having enough land to exist.

When the population skyrockets, and that process is well underway without a hunt since 2020, the bears must spread out more and travel into more populated areas.

As they do, they see humans more often, which over time makes them lose their sense of fear. They will naturally become more aggressive. It’s not their fault.

It’s the governor’s fault.

These attacks will increase. People are going to start dying. When will Gov. Murphy decide it’s time to listen to his own wildlife experts? Will it be when an elderly person bleeds out from their wounds? Or will it take someone’s young toddler being dragged into the woods and mauled to death?

Too graphic? Sorry, but this is too important. I’m not going to sugarcoat it. These are the things that will begin to happen more over the years if the bear population is not managed by hunting.

Are you reading this Gov. Murphy? Or is your head too far up your ass?

PHOENIX — The Phoenix Fire Department battled a blaze at a barn on Saturday that has left more than 100 animals dead.

After responding to a call for a structure fire on Fremont Road near 67th Avenue and West Baseline Road in Laveen, firefighters found heavy flames pouring from a barn.

Officials say that no other injuries were reported, but indicated that a number of animals in the barn were killed. Heavy smoke and flames prevented first responders from obtaining an accurate count.

The woman who owns the property told 12 News her mother went out to feed the animals and minutes later a fire broke out.

Two structures storing farm equipment, a carport and two cars were also damaged in the fire, the woman said.

The woman and her family were able to make it out safely but were unable to save 60 chickens, 40 goats and sheep, and two dogs.

A few animals survived, including a pig, pony, cows and a bull.

Officials say that the Department of Agriculture, AZ Humane Society, AZ State Vet, and AZ Exotic Animals have all been contacted for aid.

Home Fire Prevention:

The Arizona Fire & Medical Authority has released tips on how to prevent fires from starting in your home.

“More than 4,000 Americans die each year in fires and approximately 25,000 are injured,” the authority said on its website. “An overwhelming number of fires occur in the home.”

First off, the authority says that every house needs to have at least one working smoke alarm. Every level of the home and every sleeping area should have a working smoke alarm inside of it to offer the best protection.

Appliances should also be used in a way that manufacturers recommend, since overheating, shorts and sparks can all lead to a fire breaking out.

Lastly, families should have an escape plan from every room of the house.

“Caution everyone to stay low to the floor when escaping from fire and never to open doors that are hot,” the authority said. “Select a location where everyone can meet after escaping the house. Get out then call for help.”",Q2
https://apnews.com/article/iowa-ames-shootings-religion-805fe095cfb04d5716b9d755849f82d2,Man who killed 2 outside Iowa church faced harassment case,"A man who fatally shot two women before killing himself in the parking lot of an Iowa church had been romantically involved with one of the women and faced a court hearing next week on a charge of harassing her, investigators said Friday.

Johnathan Lee Whitlatch, 33, of Boone, pulled up in a pickup truck to 22-year-old Eden Montang, 21-year-old Vivian Flores and another woman just before 7 p.m. Thursday outside Cornerstone Church on the outskirts of Ames and began shooting with a 9 mm handgun, they said.

Montang and Flores were killed, Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald said, and Whitlatch shot himself. The women were friends and students at Iowa State University who were walking together to the church for a weekly service that is popular with university and high school students, the sheriff said.

Whitlatch and Montang had recently broken up, Fitzgerald said, and investigators believe Whitlach’s intent was to kill her.

“He was there for a specific purpose, which he accomplished,” the sheriff said.

About 80 other students were inside the megachurch at the time, Fitzgerald said. The church is near Interstate 35, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Des Moines.

“Our hearts break for all involved, and we are praying for everyone affected, especially the family of the victims,” the church said in the statement. The church held a prayer service for the victims Friday morning.

Whitlatch — who had a long history with law enforcement involving women — was arrested May 31 on counts of harassment and impersonating a police officer.

Details of the allegations against Whitlatch weren’t immediately available, Story County Capt. Nicholas Lennie said. Whitlatch was released on bond the same day he was arrested, Lennie said, and had been scheduled to appear in court June 10.

A search of Whitlatch’s truck following the shooting turned up ammunition and a receipt showing he bought the ammunition an hour before the shooting, Fitzgerald said. A search warrant executed at Whitlatch’s home also turned up an AR-15-style rifle, which was not used in the shooting.

The shooting follows several mass shootings in the U.S. in recent weeks that have roiled the nation. Those include last week’s shooting by an 18-year-old gunman who killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and an attack Wednesday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a medical office. On May 14 in Buffalo, New York, a white man carried out what officials say was a racist attack on a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood, killing 10 people.

Court records show that Whitlatch was arrested in November on a charge of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse and had been set to go to trial next month. Police said security camera footage shows him twice forcing his hand down a woman’s pants at a Cedar Falls bar.

In 2017, a judge approved a temporary restraining order against Whitlatch after another woman in southeastern Iowa accused him of domestic abuse, but the order was lifted a month later.

Last week, a judge ordered the state to start garnishing Whitlatch’s wages to pay child support to a woman with whom he had fathered a child. Whitlatch also had a previous child custody dispute with a different woman, according to court records, and got divorced from yet another woman in 2014.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — The gunmen in two of the nation's most recent mass shootings legally bought the semi-automatic rifles they used in their massacres after they turned 18. That's prompting Congress and some governors and state lawmakers to revisit the question of whether to raise the minimum age for purchasing such high-powered weapons.

Only six states require someone to be at least 21 years old to buy rifles and shotguns. Advocates argue that such a limit might have prevented the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 children and two teachers dead and the racially motivated supermarket attack in Buffalo, New York, that killed 10.

Lawmakers in New York and Utah have proposed legislation that would raise the minimum age to buy AR-15-style rifles to 21. A similar restriction is expected to move as soon as next week in the U.S. House, where it has some bipartisan support, but the legislation faces uncertainty in the closely divided Senate.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who chairs the National Governors Association, said the idea should be up for discussion.

""I think you've got to be able to talk about the AR-15 style weapons, and whether that's an 18 or 21 age,"" Hutchinson told CNN this week. ""You have to at least have a conversation about that.""

But Hutchinson, who leaves office in January, isn't pushing for the limit in his own state. Any proposed gun restrictions there are unlikely to find support among Republicans who control the Legislature. Arkansas Republicans are echoing their party's calls at the national level to focus instead on beefing up school security or addressing mental health.

""If we move to 21 and the shooter is 21, then they'll want to move to 25,"" said Republican state Sen. Bart Hester, who will serve as Senate president next year. ""We have established that 18 in our society is an adult who can make adult decisions, and I'm good with that.""

A recent survey of governors by The Associated Press highlighted the partisan split over whether the minimum age should be higher. Many Democratic governors who responded supported restrictions such as increasing the age to buy semi-automatic weapons. But only one Republican — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, whose state already has a minimum age of 21 to buy guns, with some exceptions — supported such a move.

Gun control advocates say raising the age offers one of the clearest steps that could have stopped or prevented the most recent mass shootings. The Uvalde attacker, Salvador Ramos, bought the AR-15 he used shortly after he turned 18.

If you are not able to consume alcohol, why should you be able to buy a gun? –Sen. Derek Kitchen, D-Salt Lake City

If Ramos hadn't been able to buy the weapon, ""maybe he would have gotten the mental health treatment he needed and this never would have happened, or maybe someone would have called some signs out to law enforcement that this person was acting erratically,"" said Sean Holihan, state legislative director with the gun control advocacy group Giffords. ""But it's clear if there had been a law in place where he would have been 21 years old, he wouldn't have been able to purchase that gun.""

Federal law already prohibits federally licensed dealers from selling handguns to anyone under age 21, but people age 18 to 20 can still buy handguns from unlicensed dealers in their state unless state law sets a higher age limit or other restrictions.

Florida is a rare example of a Republican-led state that took swift action on gun restrictions after a mass shooting. In 2018, weeks after the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, then-Gov. Rick Scott signed legislation raising the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, along with a host of other school safety and gun control measures.

Scott, a Republican, said at the time that the law balanced ""our individual rights with the need for public safety.""

Only months after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, state lawmakers and the governor approved sweeping new restrictions that won support from many Republicans in the Democratic-controlled Legislature. They included a ban on retail sales of semiautomatic rifles that accept magazines holding more than five rounds of ammunition to anyone under 21.

""We saw what transpired at Sandy Hook and what could be done in a very short period of time with that type of firearm and the magazine capacity,"" said state Senate Republican Leader Kevin Kelly. ""I think a response was necessary, and something had to be done.""

The gunmen in two of the nation's most recent mass shootings are prompting Congress and policymakers to revisit whether to raise the age limit to purchase such weapons. (Photo: Rich Pedroncelli, Associated Press)

The Buffalo and Uvalde attacks are similarly prompting New York lawmakers this week to consider an age limit increase for buying semiautomatic rifles as part of a package of gun safety bills. Under the proposal, those aged 21 and older who want to buy or possess a new semiautomatic rifle would have to obtain a license.

""New Yorkers deserve to feel safe in schools, in grocery stores, in movie theaters, in shopping malls and on our streets — and we must do everything in our power to protect them,"" Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said.

A proposal in Utah, which would raise the minimum age to buy any firearm to 21, is more of a longshot in the Republican-controlled Legislature.

""If you are not able to consume alcohol, why should you be able to buy a gun?"" Democratic Sen. Derek Kitchen said of his proposal.

The age provision in the bill before the U.S. House has some bipartisan support, but it remains unclear which aspects of the legislation will pass and get taken up in the Senate. Any measure there needs support from at least 10 Republicans to pass.

The House bill also would make it a federal offense to import, manufacture or possess large-capacity ammunition magazines and creates a grant program to buy back such magazines.

Democratic Rep. Anthony Brown of Maryland is leading efforts to increase the age for buying semi-automatic rifles. He said such guns have ""no place in our neighborhoods, let alone in the hands of an 18-year-old.""

Several Republicans have pointed to a ruling by a federal appeals court panel that found California's ban on the sale of semi-automatic weapons to adults under 21 is unconstitutional. Republican governors who decline to pursue the age increase also cite the political reality in their GOP-controlled legislatures.

For Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, raising the age limit to buy an AR-15 style rifle to 21 falls ""into the category of items the governor feels would not pass or be considered by the Ohio General Assembly,"" said press secretary Dan Tierney.

Eighteen-year-olds already are allowed to do many things in society, including joining the military, said state Sen. Terry Johnson, a southern Ohio Republican who sponsored the state's new law that makes concealed weapons permits optional for people legally allowed to carry a firearm.

""They're adults and they're Americans, and they are protected by the Second Amendment,"" Johnson said.

West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice this week said he supports raising the minimum age for buying an AR-15-style rifle to 21, but isn't proposing such a change in his state.

""First of all, do I really feel like an 18-year-old ought to be able to walk in and buy an assault weapon? I don't,"" the Republican governor told reporters this week.

Yet he appeared pessimistic about that or any other gun control measure gaining traction in his state.

""I can call 1,000 special sessions,"" he said. ""And if all I'm doing is calling 1,000 special sessions for people just to come and talk and get up on a soap box and get nothing done, why?""

He said challenges he's heard of from our local veterans and community leaders are issues with transportation support in the VA system, the tight housing market, homelessness, and making sure veterans feel safe coming into VA facilities for care, especially coming out of COVID.

“I say this to people all the time, I was nominated by the president, I was confirmed by the senate, but I work for the vets,” McDonough.

He said immediate action is underway to address the issues veterans are facing.

“The president just submitted a budget request that grows the healthcare budget at about 12 percent,” he said. “We also want to make sure when a veteran wants to get access to care in a timely way, that he or she gets that care.”

McDonough also said the government is working on housing 38,000 homeless veterans nationwide.

McDonough was hosted by Congressman Mike Levin, who introduced a bill recently signed into law, that renames the VA Medical Center in La Jolla after a local veteran.

“The legislation I especially want to highlight today is the bipartisan bill, that President Biden recently signed into law, to rename this facility after U.S. Army Captain Jennifer Moreno,” Levin said.

Captain Jennifer Moreno was a highly decorated combat veteran from San Diego who was killed in action during a deployment to Afghanistan in 2013. Levin says he's proud that this facility is the first VA Medical Center in the nation, named after a Latina Veteran.

“Her story is inspiring, her family's commitment to this facility is awe-inducing. and importantly, her story reflects the increasingly central role that women play in the united states armed forces,” said McDonough.

McDonough and Levin also met with veterans in San Marcos and Oceanside Wednesday.

Watch ""Racial Profiling 2.0"" in the video player above.

On a warm Los Angeles morning, community activists gathered outside the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters to protest data-driven policing. Jamie Garcia, a volunteer advocate with the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition — a group that has sounded the alarm on the LAPD's use of predictive policing for almost a decade — told the crowd it's just the latest chapter in a troubling history.

""There was Jim Crow, segregation, Broken Windows, CompStat, and now we're in the era of data-driven, precision-based policing,"" Garcia said. ""Yet it remains the same, the banishment of black and brown and poor people.""

The LAPD, the nation's third-largest police force and one of the first to employ this technology, is often credited with pioneering data-driven policing programs that are now used across the country. In 2011, the LAPD rolled out a predictive policing program called Los Angeles Strategic Extraction and Restoration (LASER).

""So the LASER program was designed on the metaphor that they were going to, like laser surgery, remove the tumors, the bad actors from the community,"" explains Andrew Ferguson, a law professor and predictive policing expert. ""That idea, offensive as it is, was an idea of using some kind of algorithm to identify risk.""

Jamie Garcia speaks at a protest against police tactics. CBS News

LASER was originally created to target individuals most likely to commit a violent crime based on personal criminal histories. In order to rank the risk of those known as ""chronic offenders"" within the LASER system, points were assigned based on factors like gang membership, violent crimes committed, and so-called ""quality"" interactions with police. Individuals with sufficient points were then put on a chronic offenders bulletin, which were disseminated to officers in the department.

Critics say the LASER program's configuration set up people designated as ""chronic offenders"" for failure. ""Every field interview card that gets filled out on you, you get a point. So the more often you're stopped by law enforcement and they fill out a field interview card on you, the more points you get,"" says Garcia. ""They claim you can get off the list if you don't have interactions with law enforcement, but if the instruction for law enforcement is to find you, follow you, stop you, violate you, how are you ever going to get off the list?""

Out of concern for community members who may have been unfairly targeted by LASER, the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition submitted California Public Records requests in 2017 and 2018 to push the LAPD to disclose information about the program, and followed up with a lawsuit against the LAPD in 2018 when their requests went largely ignored. Under pressure, the LAPD began to slowly release the records.

According to Garcia, the Coalition has received hundreds of documents from LAPD, including maps and mission sheets from the LASER program, but their November 2018 public records request has yet to be fulfilled. ""LAPD is still responsible for the release of more LASER Zone maps, producing the policy and procedure around the creation of LASER Zones, emails communications and much more,"" she stated.

After some records were released, the LAPD Inspector General conducted an internal audit of LASER in early 2019, and many of the community members' fears were validated. It revealed significant inconsistencies in how individuals were selected and retained in LASER. Almost half of the ""chronic offenders"" had zero or one arrest for a violent crime, and almost 10% had no ""quality interactions"" with police. The review also found Latinos and African Americans made up 84% of the 233 ""active"" chronic offenders, but did not note it as an overrepresentation because the figures were similar to the racial breakdown of violent crime arrests between 2012 and 2018.

Nonetheless, in a rare reversal for the department, the LAPD shut down LASER.

Still, during the Inspector General's presentation of the audit's findings in March 2019, Police Chief Michel Moore made LAPD's commitment to data-based policing clear.

""Fundamentally, I believe that data-driven strategies improve policing, and that improves community safety,"" he said. LAPD continues to use another location-based predictive policing program called PredPol, even after the audit found discrepancies with the program's data collection and its efficacy couldn't be determined.

For Ferguson, not enough has been done to fix the problem with predictive policing in LA ""Well, I'm somewhat of a cynic, because I'm not sure that the real lesson of that audit was taken,"" he said. ""Because the real lesson of that audit would be to bring in people who are impacted by this technology into that room before you decide the next one.""

But the LAPD says strides are being made. The LAPD did not grant an interview but provided a statement that said, in part:

""The [LASER] Chronic Offender based program is no longer in use. The LAPD is moving to a Data-Driven - Community Focused model of building trust and reducing crime built on three goals: Increase trust between police and public, reduce violent crime … specifically, gun and gang-related crime, and assist victims of crime, including businesses, residents, and those most vulnerable to crime and disorder.""

Garcia acknowledges that ending LASER and bringing greater transparency to predictive policing is a victory for Stop LAPD Spying Coalition. She said, ""It may be science, it may be an algorithm, it may be saying something fancy, but it's the same policing that's always existed, and that was the victory.""

But she also recognizes that the fight isn't over. ""What we're doing is showing that we see through it all, and we're fighting it back, and we'll continue to fight it back.""",Q2

The vacation rental company announced in a release Thursday, and in a memo co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky sent to employees, that while a few roles will remain location- or office-specific, the rest can be accomplished from anywhere in the U.S. starting in June, and from nearly anywhere in the world beginning this fall.

“Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, a new world of travel has emerged. Millions of people are now more flexible about where they live and work,” said the company. “In response to this trend of newfound flexibility, Airbnb today announced our approach to allow employees to live and work anywhere, and how we will partner with destinations to help them attract remote workers.”

Airbnb’s remote work policy is no longer a temporary answer to the pandemic — but a permanent lifestyle change for employees. The company has announced it will permanently allow workers to relocate anywhere in the country without it affecting their income.

The company shared the memo that Chesky sent to employees Thursday, pointing to the success of the company even amid the uncertainty and struggles of the past two years.

Chesky predicted that today’s startups’ penchant for having “embraced remote work and flexibility” will be the way of the future.

“This is where the world is going,” said Chesky. “We want to hire and retain the best people in the world (like you). If we limited our talent pool to a commuting radius around our offices, we would be at a significant disadvantage. The best people live everywhere, not concentrated in one area. And by recruiting from a diverse set of communities, we will become a more diverse company.”

For those still hoping to engage with coworkers face to face — as the company “is in the business of human connection above all else, and we believe that the most meaningful connections happen in person” — employees will be given the opportunity to choose whether they’d rather work from home or the office. The company will also host more “meaningful in-person gatherings.”

Compensation will not change based on where workers choose to live and work whether “from San Francisco to Nashville, or from Paris to Lyon.” The company’s single pay tiers — for salary and equity — will start, based on country, in June.

“You’ll have the flexibility to do what’s best for your life — whether that’s staying put, moving closer to family, or living in a place you’ve always dreamed of.”

Chesky announced that starting from September, Airbnb will allow employees to live and work in more than 170 countries for up to three months annually in each location.",Q2
https://www.tampafp.com/saf-files-amicus-brief-in-hawaii-handgun-permit-law/,SAF Files Amicus Brief In Hawaii Handgun Permit Law,"The Second Amendment Foundation has filed an amicus brief with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Yakutake v. Hawaii, challenging two cumbersome state laws they say are “undermining” Second Amendment rights.

Joining SAF in this important brief is the Madison Society Foundation. The brief was prepared by veteran civil rights attorney Donald Kilmer.

“This is a case,” the 13-page brief begins, “where a state-actor purports to comply with the Constitution’s text and Supreme Court case law, while intentionally undermining the fundamental right at issue. In fact, Hawaii is only engaged in a kind of malicious compliance.”

To buy a gun, a person must first go to the police station to apply for a purchase permit. Then the applicant must wait 14 days for a background check. Next, the person must go back to the seller, show the permit—which is only good for ten days for a handgun and one year for a long gun—complete the transaction, and within five days bring the firearm back to the police station for inspection.

“Hawaii has erected nonsensical hoops for gun-buyers to jump through to exercise a fundamental right,” the brief continues. “The passive-aggressive regulations at issue in this case are mirrored by remarkably similar barriers to voting that were struck down by the Supreme Court more than 50 years ago.”

“If law-abiding citizens were subjected to similar laws while attempting to exercise any other constitutionally-enumerated right, it would be an outrage,” said SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. “The requirements to merely buy a handgun are solely designed to discourage Hawaii citizens of doing so. The two Hawaii requirements are disgustingly obvious in their intent, which is why the District Court found for plaintiffs Todd Yakutake and David Kikukawa.”

He noted the District Court “found that Hawaii had failed to produce any evidence to justify its scheme under any standard of review.”

“It is alarming,” Gottlieb observed, “that such statutory requirements to impede and discourage gun ownership exist anywhere in the country. Hawaii’s gun control scheme is deliberately complicated, and ultimately frustrating. It cannot be allowed to stand.”

Two days before the end of the academic year the students of Robb Elementary School wore their Sunday best for a “Footloose and Fancy” event — a prelude to a long-awaited summer of drive-in movies, lakeside barbecues and trips to amusement parks.

Tuesday morning, as 10-year-old fourth graders like Xavier Javier Lopez and Alexandria “Lexi” Rubio received honor roll certificates and other awards, a bullied loner named Salvador Ramos was home with his grandmother in Uvalde, a small, tight-knit Texas town nestled roughly midway between San Antonio and the border with Mexico.

Within hours, the little aspiring lawyers, police officers, dancers and biologists of Robb Elementary would cross paths with the high school dropout who gifted himself two AR-15 style rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition he legally purchased for his 18th birthday one week earlier.

At 11:33 a.m. Ramos entered the school, unimpeded, through a rear door that a teacher had left propped open. He fired more than 100 rounds in the school and two adjoining classrooms. A Border Patrol tactical team fatally shot him more than an hour after the terror began.

The massacre claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers in the deadliest US school shooting in nearly a decade. Haunting details emerged almost daily. A father gathered with other distraught parents outside the school. He pleaded with officers for gear so he confront the gunman himself. An 11-year-old survivor played dead after smearing herself with her friend’s blood. The gunman looked one teacher in the eye. “Goodnight,” he said coldly before killing her.

Grieving parents planned funerals as they seethed over the delayed response. Law enforcement officials for days offered conflicting explanations. A public safety department colonel admitted Friday that waiting in a school hallway while trapped students made 911 calls was the “wrong decision” by the commanding officer at the scene. It’s not clear how many lives the mistake may have cost.

Uvalde’s nearly 16,000 working-class, mostly Latino residents are now the latest mourners in an eerily familiar American tragedy.

“It was something I never want to see again,” said Judge Eulalio “Lalo” Diaz, who, as Uvalde County justice of the peace, had the task of identifying the slain children and teachers in a county with no medical examiner. “These are our children.”

‘Just wait for it’

Ramos, who had no criminal record, had few friends and largely kept to himself. In the weeks leading up to the massacre, he exhibited a dark side in livestreams on the social media app Yubo. Several users who witnessed the recent videos said he told girls he would rape them, showed off a rifle he bought, and threatened to shoot up schools. They didn’t take him seriously until now.

At about 11 a.m. on Tuesday he called a 15-year-old girl in Germany. He had befriended her earlier this month on the social media app.

The young man and the teen from Frankfurt spoke daily on FaceTime. They also communicated on Yubo and played and chatted on the Plato gaming app. He was curious about life in Germany. He confessed to spending a lot of time alone at home.

“He looked happy and comfortable talking to me,” said the girl, whose mother gave permission for her to be interviewed.

Still, some chats alarmed her. He admitted hurling dead cats at houses. And he never mentioned plans to meet friends.

In videos and text messages, Ramos spoke of visiting his new friend in Europe. One message included a flight itinerary.

“I’m coming over soon,” he wrote.

On Monday, Ramos told the girl he had received a package of bullets that expanded upon entering tissue.

Why? she asked.

“Just wait for it,” he said, ominously.

The next day, in the call just after 11 on the morning of the shootings, he told the girl he loved her.

Screen shots of messages Ramos sent soon after the call show he complained that his grandmother had contacted AT&T about “my phone.”

“It’s annoying,” he wrote.

At 11:06 a.m. came a chilling message: “I just shot my grandma in her head.”

His final text to his new online friend was at 11:21 a.m. local time — then early evening in Germany: “Ima go shoot up” an elementary school.

Gunman opens fire, then enters school

With days left in the school year, the second- through fourth-graders of Robb Elementary collected their awards Tuesday morning.

The children smiled and posed for pictures. Students watched Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” in the waning days of a long semester.

Less than a mile away, Ramos — after shooting his 66-year-old grandmother in the face and texting his German friend one last time — drove a pickup to the school campus and crashed the truck in a ditch. It was 11:28 a.m. local time.

He opened fire on two people outside a funeral home across the street but did not hit them. His grandmother managed to call 911. She was airlifted to a hospital in San Antonio and is expected to survive.

Derek Gonzalez was near the school when he heard the gunfire.

“Shooting! Shooting!” he recalled a woman shouting outside as bullets struck the ground.

Within minutes, Ramos made his way from the road to the school parking lot and began firing at classroom windows. Moments before he pulled open the building’s unlocked rear door, a school safety officer in a patrol car drove right by the gunman, who had hunkered down behind a car.

At 11:33 a.m. Ramos moved down a hallway and into one of two adjoining classrooms — 111 and 112. At no time since crashing the truck did police confront him.

Minutes later, seven officers arrived at the school. Three officers approached the locked classroom where the gunman had now barricaded himself. Two officers were shot from behind a door and suffered graze wounds.

A barrage of more than 100 rounds echoed through the halls of Robb Elementary in the slaughter’s first minutes. It was at least the 30th school shooting at a K-12 school this year.

He said ‘goodnight,’ then shot teacher

Miah Cerrillo, 11, was watching the Disney movie with classmates. Alerted to a shooter in the building, teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia moved to protect their young charges. When one teacher tried to lock the classroom door, the gunman shot out a door window.

The teacher backpedaled and the gunman followed her. He said “Goodnight,” then shot her. He turned and opened fire on the other teacher and Miah’s classmates.

The girl cried at times and wrapped herself in a blanket as she recalled the horror. She heard screams and more shots when the gunman entered a connected classroom. Between rounds, the shooter played music Miah described as “sad — like you want people to die.”

Miah feared he would come back for her and a few surviving friends. She covered her hands with the blood of a classmate slain next to her and smeared herself with it. She played dead.

At one point Miah and a classmate managed to use the phone of their dead teacher to call 911.

“Please come,” she told the dispatcher. “We’re in trouble.”

Commander makes ‘the wrong decision’

Around the time students started making 911 calls as many as 19 law enforcement officers had already taken cover in the hallway, at 12:03 p.m. They took no action and waited for classroom keys and tactical equipment.

At 12:16 p.m. a girl who made several 911 calls told a dispatcher that eight or nine children were alive in her classroom.

“The on-scene commander at that time believed that it had transitioned from an active shooter to a barricaded subject,” Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Col. Steven McCraw said on Friday, describing the call not to confront the shooter as “the wrong decision, period.”

“There’s no excuse for that,” he added.

The official who made the decision not to breach the classroom was the school district police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, who has not spoken publicly since two very brief press statements on the day of the shootings. He has three decades of law enforcement experience. There was no response to attempts to reach Arredondo at his home on Friday.

Before the end of the noontime hour on Tuesday, at least 10 911 calls were made from classrooms, including several from the same girl pleading for help. She whispered at one point that multiple bodies surrounded her in Room 112.

Amerie Jo Garza turned 10 years old weeks before the attack. She got her first cell phone as a gift. Classmates would later tell her stepfather, med aide Angel Garza, that she was killed while trying to call 911.

“She was just trying to call authorities,” said Angel Garza, sobbing as he cradled a photo of Amerie holding an honor roll certificate.

“I just want people to know she died trying to save her classmates.”

The chaos extended to outside the school

During the siege, some responding officers helped evacuate students and teachers in other parts of the school.

Frustrated parents gathered outside during the rampage. They urged officers holding them back to storm the school to stop the bloodshed.

One parent, Victor Luna, pleaded with officers to give him their gear. His son Jayden survived the shooting but he didn’t know that at the time.

Luna and other parents watched nervously as officers escorted students from the school. Video from the scene showed officers physically restraining some parents.

Throughout the night distraught families gathered at the SSGT Willie de Leon Civic Center, where buses delivered survivors. DNA samples were collected from parents to confirm whether their children were among the victims.

As the death toll grew, relatives who spent hours watching as others were reunited with their sons and daughters walked away sobbing from the makeshift reunification center.

Doctors treat ‘destructive wounds’

The AR-15 rounds struck the heart of a small town.

Xavier and Lexi, the honor roll students, were among the victims. As were teachers Mireles and Garcia, who had taught together for five years. Two days after Garcia’s death, her husband, Joe, suffered a fatal heart attack. Their relatives said he died of a broken heart.

Other young victims were José Flores Jr., 10, and Eliana “Ellie” Garcia, who was 9. Nevaeh Alyssa Bravo was 10. Jacklyn Jaylen Cazares, 10, was killed along with her 10-year-old cousin and classmate Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez.

There was Makenna Lee Elrod, 10; Uziyah Garcia, 10; Jayce Carmelo Luevanos, 10; Tess Marie Mata, 10; Maranda Mathis, 11; Alithia Ramirez, 10; Maite Rodriguez, 10; Layla Salazar, 11; Jailah Nicole Silguero, 10; Eliahana ‘Elijah’ Cruz Torres, 10; and Rogelio Torres, 10.

Nearly 20 people were injured in the attack with a rifle that has been used in some of the most notorious and deadly mass killings in recent history.

The AR-15 style rifle was engineered to maximize its kill rate by raking enemy soldiers with high-velocity rounds. The original designers explained that the speed of the impact causes the bullet to tumble after it penetrates tissue. The result: Catastrophic injuries.

“We were treating destructive wounds and what that means is that there were large areas of tissue missing from the body,” said Dr. Lillian Liao, pediatric trauma medical director at University Hospital in San Antonio, which treated three children from Uvalde. “They required emergency surgery because there was significant blood loss.”

It was hard knowing many victims were likely already dead by the time police killed the shooter.

“When we’re dealing with high-velocity firearm injuries, we may not get a whole lot of patients,” she said, wiping away tears. “I think that’s what has hit us the most. Not the patients that we did receive and we are honored to treat … but the patients that we did not receive.”

A grieving dad has but one question

In all, 80 minutes elapsed between the time officers were first called at 11:30 a.m. to the moment a federal tactical team entered locked classrooms and killed the gunman at 12:50 p.m.

To Miah, the 11-year-old survivor, it felt like three hours. She was there on the classroom floor covered in the blood of a classmate.

At 12:43 p.m. and again four minutes later a girl in the school called 911.

“Please send the police now,” she implored. It’s unclear if that was Miah on the line.

After waiting about 35 minutes outside the classroom, a US Border Patrol tactical team used a key to open a door. They had been at the school since 12:15 p.m. The teenage gunman kicked open the door of a classroom closet and opened fire, said a source familiar with the situation.

One agent held a shield. At least two others behind him engaged the shooter.

“It’s going to haunt them forever,” the source said, referring to the agents who responded and what they saw at the scene.

The siege was over.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had earlier in the week praised the “amazing courage” of the responding officers. On Friday he was in Uvalde for a news conference announcing state aid for the families affected by the shooting.

Abbott, who had canceled his appearance that day at the National Rifle Association convention 280 miles away in Houston, said he was “absolutely livid” that he was initially “misled” about the police response.

In the chaos outside the school on Tuesday, Angel Garza, the med aide, came upon a little girl who was covered in blood. She was crying. Her best friend had been killed.

Angel Garza asked her the name of the dead girl. It was his stepdaughter, Amerie Jo. That’s how he learned Amerie was gone.

Amerie’s biological father, Alfred Garza, was also outside the school as the massacre unfolded.

Days later, as gun enthusiasts and politicians gathered at the NRA convention and the governor questioned the actions of law enforcement, the grieving father had one question.

“Who’s going to pay for this?” Alfred Garza said.

ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan will speak at a Twitter Spaces session today as part of the party's campaign to galvanise public support for early elections in the country.

The PTI has been holding rallies after the ouster of the Imran Khan government through a no-confidence motion earlier this month, saying the party has been removed by a foreign power.

According to a PTI statement, the party's social media team members Dr Arslan Khan and Jibran Ilyas will host the session at 10pm.

https://augustafreepress.com/biden-congress-taking-additional-steps-to-alleviate-baby-formula-shortage/,"Biden, Congress taking additional steps to alleviate baby formula shortage","President Biden is invoking the Defense Production Act to require suppliers to direct needed resources to infant formula manufacturers, the administration announced on Wednesday.

The president also announced the creation of Operation Fly Formula, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA to use Defense Department planes to import formula from abroad.

Biden said Wednesday that he has directed his team “to do everything possible to ensure there’s enough safe baby formula and that it’s quickly reaching families that need it the most. This is one of my top priorities.”

Seventh District Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger has been pushing the administration to take these steps for several days.

“I am glad the administration is listening to the concerns of Virginia parents during this crisis,” Spanberger said. “We need to keep taking actions that will get more formula on the shelves — and until then, we cannot be satisfied with our progress. In addition to invoking the DPA, I’m continuing to press the administration and industry leaders to cut more red tape, get any closed facilities up and running, and increase imports of safe baby formula from other countries. Virginia parents and babies do not have time for delays when it comes to addressing this shortage.”

The House of Representatives was also busy on the baby formula front on Wednesday, advancing two pieces of legislation to help combat the shortage.

H.R. 7790, the Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022, would provide $28 million in emergency funding to give the FDA the resources it needs to address the urgent infant formula shortage. This funding will help increase the number of FDA inspection staff, provide resources for personnel working on formula issues, help the agency stop fraudulent baby formula from entering the marketplace, and improve data collection on the formula market.

H.R. 7791, the Access to Baby Formula Act, would provide flexibility for low-income families, so that they can continue purchasing safe infant formula with their WIC benefits during extenuating circumstances, such as a supply chain disruption.

“No parent should ever have to wonder how they will feed their child,” Fourth District Congressman A. Donald McEachin said. “The shortage has taken a particularly dangerous toll on vulnerable women and children throughout the country who already struggle to cover these costs. As a father, I know how important it is to provide for and nourish our children, which is why I voted to pass this legislation to provide much-needed flexibilities and help deliver on WIC’s promise to provide families in need with the nutrition necessary for children to live and develop.”

LA GRANGE, Ga. — An 18-year-old is dead after an outing with a Georgia rapper turned violent, authorities said.

Nasr Midian Kahenti Atun El Bebley-Calvin was shot in the head and dropped off at Grady Memorial Hospital on April 24 around 1 a.m., LaGrange Police said. The 18-year-old died due to his injuries.

Authorities said it had been difficult for APD to pinpoint what led to Bebley-Calvin getting shot due to a lack of witness cooperation but were able to work with LaGrange Police to determine shots were fired at Lafayette Parkway.

Police said the Atlanta teen was in LaGrange with a performer known as Cold Hearted Savage. The rapper and other artists performed at Club TRU along East Depot Street on the night of April 23.

Following the performance, Bebley-Calvin and others left the club in several vehicles to make their way back to Atlanta, according to investigators.

As CrimeOnline previously reported, a Norfolk County grand jury indicted Karen Read, 42, on second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter, and leaving the scene of a collision causing death charges. She’s accused of killing her boyfriend, identified as John O’Keefe, a Boston police officer.

According to court documents, Read was initially arrested on manslaughter charges in February, after she allegedly hit O’Keefe with her SUV, then left him for dead outside a friend’s residence in Canton. Police said the incident happened after Read had a night out involving drinking.

The Boston Globe reports that both Read and O’Keefe went to two bars in the Canton area with friends on the night before the incident. Once the bars closed, the group agreed to meet up at a friend’s house, where O’Keefe was hit by Read’s SUV.

After the incident, Read allegedly drove home and later, didn’t remember what happened, according to police. The following morning, she became concerned when O’Keefe wasn’t home and she noticed damage to her vehicle, New York Post reports.

Read sent out text messages looking for her boyfriend and asked friends to check if O’Keefe was still at the friend’s home. That’s when he was discovered lying unresponsive in a snow bank. Read arrived at the scene shortly after.

“I hit him, I hit him, I hit him, I hit him,” Read later said to a paramedic at the scene, according to NBC 10.

Read’s lawyer, David Yannetti, said “there was no criminal intent” and that couple had been in a loving relationship, with the defendant raising his nephew and niece that he adopted.

O’Keefe was rushed to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police announced upgraded charges this week and arrested Read again Thursday evening at her Mansfield home.

Read pleaded not guilty to the charges against her; she’s been released from jail on $100,000 bail and is expected back in court in August.

ISLAMABAD – Dunya Media Group looks set to fly high now that its owner and CEO Mian Amir Mehmood has got approval for a license to run a charter airline service.

The federal cabinet approved a charter license Class II (domestic) for his Liberty Air Limited on Thursday.

Those in the know say the service will focus on smaller cities in Pakistan, and that more licenses are likely to be granted to others.

The media group’s television Dunya News has been in the news lately for laying off staff and slapping pay cuts.

On Thursday journalists in Lahore protested in front of the channel’s offices against the layoffs and salary reductions.

Their talks late last month with Mian Amir in a bid to resolve the issue did not yield results after the CEO did not honor his promise to reinstate staffers.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/6/24/23180802/whats-next-after-supreme-courts-dobbs-ruling,What’s next after Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling?,"Is it still legal to get an abortion in Illinois now that the U.S. Supreme Court has issued its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization?

Yes. Abortion rights activists have worked hard in recent years to ensure that state law explicitly protects access to abortions in Illinois. In 2017, they successfully lobbied the Legislature to throw out a “trigger law” that would have reinstated a ban on abortions automatically if the Supreme Court rolled back Roe vs. Wade.

In 2019, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the Illinois Reproductive Rights bill, which enshrined abortion as a fundamental health care right, required insurers in Illinois to cover abortion procedures, and generally regulated abortion as it would any medical procedure.

Last year, the state repealed a law requiring notification of parents when a minor seeks an abortion.

“The hard work was already done in Illinois,” said Brigid Leahy, director of government relations for Planned Parenthood Illinois. “We have the Reproductive Health Act in Illinois ensuring access to care, and that abortion in Illinois is not only legal but also accessible.”

What’s next? Will it be harder to receive an abortion in Illinois?

Possibly, but not because of changes to the law here.

Clinics that provide abortion care across the state expect an influx of women from surrounding states. All adjacent states — Indiana, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — are poised to ban or dramatically curtail abortion access. Across the United States, legal experts expect as many as 26 states to ban abortions after the Supreme Court ruling.

Planned Parenthood of Illinois anticipates that as many as 30,000 additional patients will come to Illinois for abortions — roughly triple the number in 2020. There were 46,000 abortions performed in Illinois in 2020, the most recent year for which the state Department of Health has statistics.

Planned Parenthood has anticipated other states’ expanded restrictions on abortion for years and has opened new sites in south suburban Flossmoor and north suburban Waukegan to serve women coming from Indiana and Wisconsin, respectively.

Will there be any impact on services that reproductive health care providers can offer?

Within the state, the services offered — including abortion — will remain the same.

But services that abortion providers have recently expanded might face new regulation. Planned Parenthood has created a “telehealth” option that connects women seeking abortions to a medical professional via online video conference.

Patients who can log in from inside Illinois’ borders can schedule a relatively brief online appointment, and a doctor can prescribe medication that will end their pregnancy, pills that the organization will mail to any address in Illinois. Medication abortions accounted for the majority of abortions performed in recent years, but Planned Parenthood’s Leahy said the option may be one of many that soon will be targeted by legislatures in other states.

“It’s not enough for them to have the ban in their own states,” she said. “We’re already hearing about anti-abortion legislators trying to figure out how to reach across their borders and prevent abortions in other states.”

Are abortion laws in Illinois likely to become more restrictive?

It does not seem so. In addition to the abortion rights legislation that passed in 2017, 2019 and last year, the state legislature appears likely to maintain a strong Democratic majority, even in what many expect to be a down year for the party in the November elections.

It contained some of the country's most priceless historical documents.

Then Attorney General Tom Clark thought something dramatic was needed to increase American public awareness of their heritage of freedom and the responsibilities of citizenship. Visitors to the Freedom Train were asked to take the following pledge:

The Freedom Pledge

I am an American. A free American.

Free to speak — without fear.

Free to worship God in my own way.

Free to stand for what I think right.

Free to oppose what I believe wrong.

Free to choose those who govern my country.

This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold.

For myself and all mankind.

The Freedom Train stopped in El Paso on Feb. 14, 1948. Nearly 600 people an hour toured the exhibit for the 12 hours the train was in town.

Thousands file through Freedom Train Crowd sees historic documents

Feb. 15, 1948, El Paso Times

Thousands of El Pasoans lined up for hours Saturday to pass through The Freedom Train and view its precious cargo of America’s historical documents.

When the last person had passed out of the train, shortly after 10 p.m., the total attendance recorded was 6,971, an average of nearly 600 an hour for the 12-hour stay in El Paso.

The train arrived at 7 a.m., over Southern Pacific Lines from Del Rio. Three hours earlier youngsters already were starting a six-hour vigil to be the first inside the cars after the official party had been escorted through.

Voices hushed

It was an orderly crowd that moved through the roped lanes leading to the first car. Inside the train, as in a cathedral, voices were hushed. Comments were whispered as men, women, children of all races filed past the cases and saw for the first time the originals of manuscripts they had studied and memorized in school.

Mayor Pro Tem Karl Wyler, speaking in the absence of Mayor Dan Ponder, welcomed the train to El Paso. He called the train a “glorious expression of American unity – at a time when unity within our country is indeed precious.”

“It has all been inspiring,” Wyler said, “but let us not forget for a moment the unselfish and untiring efforts of the many people who so warmly brought this inspiration home to us all. …We s a community should achieve certain definite goals from the visit of the Freedom train. By learning the foundations of good government we should strive to see that the government of our own community and our state is progressively better.”

Crowd three blocks long

By the time the ceremonies were ended and the public had started through the train, the columns extended west from the spur track berthing the train at Campbell Street, reached Kansas Street, and continued in a long loop back to and north on Campbell Street.

A public address system kept urging those inside and out of the train to keep moving, to remember that “thousands are waiting behind you.”

Three cars of the seven-car train contained the 127 manuscripts and printed matter on display. The other cars house the maintenance party, the 27 Marines headed by Col. R.F. Scott, and officials of the American Heritage Foundation, sponsors of the train, in chare of W.H.S. O’Brien.

Again the voice over the loudspeaker sounded the objectives of the foundation in arranging the four: “To develop a greater awareness of the advantages we enjoy as Americans, emphasizing the relationship of our hard-won personal freedoms in our development as the strongest nation of free people in history.

“To persuade all Americans that only by active person participation in the affairs of the nation can we safeguard and preserve our liberties and continue to demonstrate to ourselves and to the world that the way of free men is best.”

The documents go all the way back to Columbus’ time, including his official letter announcing the discovery of the new land Exhibited was a copy of the second Latin edition o the letter, printed in Rome in 1493. There was the manuscript of the signing of the Magna Carta by King John of England in 1215.

History moves forward through the cars, bringing the protest of the nine colonies, their 1765 declaration in which they protested against “taxation without representation,” an early printing lent by the Library of Congress.

Original Washington letters

Youngsters who will be celebrating Washington’s birthday in a week saw his original letters and saw in his handwriting the farewell address delivered in 1796. Many who had doubted the story of Paul Revere’s ride saw the manuscript, dated April 29, 1775, in which Revere was given his commission as messenger to the Committee of Safety.

History’s footprints continued through Washington’s own copy of the Constitution and Alexander Hamilton’s draft of his report on the public credit in 1790. Many of the manuscripts had cross-outs and inserts where last-minute changes had been made.

Emancipation proclamation

El Pasoans saw the original sheet upon which the words of the national anthem were written by Francis Scott Key. They saw Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation in his own hand, and Gen. Robert E. Lee’s letter accepting the presidency of Washington College, in 1865.

There were historical communications signed by both Roosevelts, and publications testing the freedom of the press, going back to 1734. Moving up to modern times, the “greatest blank check” ever written is shown. It is a list of signatures prepared for the United Nations Charter before the charter was available to attach the signatures.

Several cases held flags, including Commodore Perry’s gonfalon, the famous Iwo Jima flag raised on Mount Sribachi by the U.S. Marines, and General Eisenhower’s personal flag.

The pathetic message from Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, announcing that he was forced to surrender, is beside messages outlining Operation “Overlord” and “Anvil” and tell of coming invasions. In the final car is the surrender instrument of Japanese forces in the Philippines and the German unconditional surrender.

Hard to believe they

At 9:45 p.m. the doors closed and a number of disappointed visitors were turned away. The train left for Santa Fe, N.M., late Saturday, after which it will make an appearance in Albuquerque, N.M, and proceed to Douglas, Ari.

Comment of those coming from the train ran usually to: “If only there were time to read those documents, to study them a while.”

One girl, gushing her excitement, breathed: “It’s hard to believe they’re real, isn’t it?”

Police said the charges stem from the shooting that happened on April 2 on Cleveland Road.

Officers responded to a shooting at an unpermitted trail ride and concert at 5050 Cleveland Road at around 12:13 a.m. Promoters for the event called it the ""Second Annual Epic Easter Bike Out and Field Party.""

Dallas Chief of Police Eddie Garcia spoke to reporters Thursday following the arrests of two men in connection to a deadly shooting at a Dallas concert venue in April.

Dallas police said 16 people, including four minors, were shot during the concert. A 17th person was also injured at the scene, but not by gunfire.

Kealon Dejuane Gilmore, 26, was killed in the shooting. Gilmore is reported to have been shot in the head near the stage and died at the scene.

""It took a bit of the burden off me,"" Gilmore's mother, Shalonda Gilmore, said at a Thursday news conference with an attorney by her side. ""I still don't have my son at the end of the day. It's just the beginning. It's going to be a long process.""

Dallas Police Department

According to police, the preliminary investigation determined that after a fight that broke out at the event, Calhoun and Givens both fired handguns into the crowd.

""I don't really know how to feel about this right now because I don't know, it's the 'why?' for me,"" Monecia Anderson said. Her 22-year-old daughter, Jazmin Anderson, was shot in the head. She is out of the hospital and home recovering.

""She's a walking miracle,"" Monecia Anderson said. ""That's what I pretty much call her. She is a walking miracle.""

Still, all those involved are having to face emotional scars that may never heal.

Not only that I'm hurt because of my son,"" Gilmore said. ""I'm hurt because my other son had to witness it. I have on that's gone and one that's having problems now. He's not the same. I'm not the same. None of us are the same.""

Givens and Calhoun were taken to the Dallas County Jail. Bond will be determined by a magistrate.

The investigation into this incident is ongoing, police said. Officers are working to identify other suspects who fired weapons and other suspects involved in the fight leading up to the shooting.

""There's a cost to pay,"" Jazmin Anderson's father said. ""It's not in my hands to judge you. It's not in my hands to convict you. That's between the law and up to God. So you will have your day coming in court.""

https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-708818,US gun madness itself is the mental health issue - opinion,"The gun madness that Americans seem prepared to accept in perpetuity is unique among developed nations and reflects an incredible paralysis in a country that for decades was a beacon of innovation and democracy to the world. And the most amazing thing is that this most political of issues carries no visible consequences for those responsible, and that means the Republican Party. That is especially damning because it suggests that the United States has ceased to be a rational society.

How else to explain that a politician like former president Donald Trump can continue to be popular and be considered a major contender to return to the presidency in 2024, while reacting to the latest mass murders with repeat nonsense about a mental health problem and dangerous proposals to arm schools more heavily?

The United States, which leads the developed world in gun murders and massacres by shocking magnitudes, has no particular mental health issue. The World Health Organization reports the percentage of Americans with depression is 5.9%, compared to 4.7% in Canada, 5.9% in Australia and 4.5% in the UK. Other mental health metrics show similar results.

America’s schools are not more poorly protected than in most other countries. Indeed, nowhere else where I’ve ever lived – all over Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean – are schools regularly attacked. In the US, guns are now the number one cause of death in children and there have been 27 shootings at schools, as of this writing, in 2022. The amount of school shootings in Israel, which has far more stringent gun ownership laws than America and a genuine terrorism problem, is none.

Even before the recent massacres in Buffalo, at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and over the weekend in my hometown of Philadelphia, a recent FBI study found that US homicides were up 30% in 2020 compared to the previous year, reaching 21,570, more than three-quarters caused by guns being fired, and 2021 was worse. The Gun Violence Archive said 18,900 Americans were killed by guns through December 1, 2021. US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden look at a memorial in the wake of a weekend shooting at a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York, US May 17, 2022. (credit: REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID)

No country outside the Third World comes even close. The World Population Review ranked the US atop the developed world with 12.2 gun deaths per 100,000 people (almost four times the next-highest, Finland), with only countries like Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, Swaziland and Jamaica performing worse. Most European countries suffered under 1.5 deaths per hundred thousand people.

What is the only factor that correlates to the gun violence? The level of gun ownership and the ease of purchasing weapons.

The US ranks number one in the world by far in guns per people, with 120.5 guns per 100 people – double the figure in runners-up Falkland Islands and Yemen and four times the rate in any developed country. It has, incredibly, more guns than people – though only a minority of its people actually own a weapon.

The weapons lobby and its adherents will stick to their proverbial guns no matter what in order to preserve their twisted ideas about freedom, so no arguments or logic will win them over. My aim is to persuade the persuadable – not so much that gun control is needed but that it is possible.

When one speaks to rational people who do not share the gun obsession, other arguments come up. One of them is race: the idea that America’s large black minority is so disenfranchised and that the whites are so racist that nothing can prevent a madness in their interactions. This, too, is belied by the fact that other countries had slavery and other countries have large and potentially restive ethnic and racial minorities, from Britain and France to Brazil and Israel. None suffer gun violence of the sort. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now

THE LAST argument, that there is nothing to be done, is the most dispiriting. This rests on two ideas: a distorted reading of the Second Amendment and the idea that political change is impossible because of the electoral system being stacked in favor of the Republicans (as one example, reliably Republican Wyoming has the same two senators as California, with 70 times the population).

The much-prized amendment promises a right to “keep and bear arms” but within “a well-regulated militia.” The conservatives’ insistence on interpreting this as an unlimited right assigned to all individuals is just that – an insistence, and one that is political.

That is why one of the last things rational Americans should do is repeat the tired urgings to not “politicize the discussion.” It is an acquiescence that amounts to an abdication of democracy, because it enables the Republicans to continue to pay almost no political price for pursuing policies that harm the country and are opposed by most people. Rest assured that if Democrats were guilty of such a thing, no one would hesitate to politicize it.

The opposition to gun control comes from the Republican Party, beholden to the National Rifle Association, one of their major donors. While millions of its followers are a rather small minority, many and probably most are dependable single-issue voters who therefore punch above their weight.

Most Americans, in fact, want greater gun control, as every survey shows. But this rolling national disaster will not be fixed by timid Democratic attempts to forge bipartisanship, such as President Joe Biden’s Comprehensive Plan released last summer, which targets rogue dealers and offers ATF inspections data to states that might want it.

What is needed is a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and a massive move to limit new purchases of guns. Criminals or anyone else caught with unlicensed guns should be jailed for long years. There should be a requirement for insurance on guns, the same as cars.

Americans not only are not especially mentally unwell, they are absolutely as rational as others: faced with this new reality, the situation would pretty quickly wind down, as it did in Australia, where gun deaths fell from American to European levels after it banned most guns a few years ago.

The Republicans will never agree to this and the Supreme Court, as currently constituted, would probably strike it down. The Supreme Court is, at this point, a political organization dominated by the Republican Party. This is what happens when the Senate appoints judges – another rarity among developed democracies.

All around the world and across America, people are asking whether something will finally change. The question arises each time there is a spike and the answer is always the same: no, because the Republicans and the NRA will ride out the anger and flood the zone with propaganda. This is debilitating to America’s ability to continue to show leadership in the world; it looks more and more like a failed state. This is especially devastating to Israel, which needs American support to survive.

Anyone in America who wants to see something change this needs to take off the gloves, stop being polite with the manifestly impolite, and yes, politicize the issue. The Republicans are responsible for the continuing gun insanity and anyone voting for them is complicit in continuing the madness that is America’s only mental health issue.

https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/brassfield-gorrie-vandalism-cop-city-contractor-office-atlanta-police-training-facility,Vandals responsible for alleged $80k in damages at 'Cop City' contractor's office,"Atlanta police are working to learn the identities of several people seen vandalizing the office of a contractor working with the Atlanta Police Foundation to contract a new training facility, also known as ""Cop City.""

Brassfield & Gorrie's office in Birmingham, Alabama, had several broken windows, paint splashed on its sign and graffiti painted on a window that said: ""Drop Cop City or Else.""

The business claims the vandals are responsible for $80,000 in damage to the property.

Crime Stoppers said incident happened between 2:46 a.m. and 2:50 a.m. on May 13. Investigators believe the suspects are two men and one woman.

The vandals appeared to leave the scene in a white Toyota Prius on 31st Street.

Anyone with information can contact Crime Stoppers of Greater Atlanta at 404-577-TIPS (8477).

What is ‘Cop City?’

Atlanta City Council approved a proposal to lease forested land in unincorporated DeKalb County to the Atlanta Police Foundation to build a training facility for police and first responders.

City council tabled a vote on a controversial state-of-the-art training facility on Aug. 16, stating public engagement on the matter was poorly executed.

The Atlanta Police Foundation plans to fund and build a new facility on 85 acres and preserve the remaining portion of the 265-acres property as green space, which is currently not accessible to the public.

Video shows 'Molotov cocktail' thrown at 'Cop City' site

Atlanta Police Department Assistant Chief Darin Schierbaum said no one was injured when someone threw a ""glass container with an accelerant inside and a crude ignition device."" Hours later police said someone threw another ""Molotov cocktail,"" which didn't ignite. The incident happened on Key Road.

Marlon Kautz of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund told FOX 5 Atlanta he'd seen nothing but ""peaceful protesting"" and ""no evidence"" of the incendiary device. It's unclear where the explosive was thrown in relation to the protest where police arrested at least seven people.

The ‘forest defenders’ hold ongoing protest

Some people who call themselves ""forest defenders"" have been camping on the site since last year. Police said they have been sabotaging construction efforts and the protesters have claimed they have driven spikes into trees to make them hazardous to cut down.

""This is an attempt to demoralize a vibrant and diverse movement that is led by local community members against the replacement of the largest urban tree canopy in the United States the largest police training compound in the United States,"" said Mae Johnson, an activist who lives near the site.

Over the last month, the group has protested at the company contracted to build the training facility and even its CEO's home. Last week, police in Cobb County arrested two protesters for vandalizing the office of one of the building contractors involved in the project.

Over the weekend, the activist said officers charged at them unprovoked while protesting in the streets near Freedom Park.

Multiple people in the group identified themselves as Georgia residents.

What is the ‘Stop Cop City’ movement?

Protestors oppose ""the expansion of the police state"" and said the Atlanta Police Foundation is threatening the Atlanta forest. Tuesday's protest was one of several on the property recently. There was a protest at Inman Park where people were arrested ""with extreme force,"" according to Kautz.

""We are not extremest, we are neighbors of the forest, residents of south Atlanta, most importantly, we are intelligent people who know the future of the world is on fire,"" Mae Johnson, who said she lives in a neighborhood near ""Cop City.""

She said the ""Stop Cop City"" movement has broad support because of the environmental impact the forest has on the city. City council members said they would be planting hundreds more trees for each tree that would be cut down.

https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-reverses-trumps-alaska-oil-plan/,Biden reverses Trump’s Alaska oil plan,"The Biden administration released yesterday a long-expected management plan for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, allowing potential drilling across roughly half of the 23-million-acre swath of public land in the Arctic Circle.

The final decision reverses a Trump-era plan that had opened the majority of the reserve to oil and gas leasing. It comes as the White House faces tensions on both sides of the political divide for its energy policies, with demands on the left to shut down oil development on federal lands to combat climate change and criticism on the right for not making it easier to drill on public land amid rising gas prices.

The record of decision, issued by the Bureau of Land Management, doesn’t remake the wheel for the NPR-A.

Advertisement

It reverses the controversial Trump-era plan — called an integrated activity plan (IAP) — that had opened 82 percent of the reserve’s lands to oil and gas prospectors, and it reinstates the previous management plan, penned under the Obama administration in 2013.

The restored IAP protects nearly half of the reserve’s untrammeled lands, including caribou and avian habitats, from oil and gas leasing, as well as includes new stipulations for potential drilling, like revised operating standards to protect endangered species.

The Interior Department declined to respond to questions about today’s decision. But BLM noted in its announcement of the decision that it was in line with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s priorities, “including the review of existing oil and gas programs to ensure balance on America’s public lands and waters to benefit current and future generations.”

Biden’s decision to reinstate the 2013 plan was expected. The administration noted in a court filing in January that it would reissue the record of decision, nulling the Trump-era changes. The White House had also flagged the NPR-A’s management plan for review shortly after taking office, and Biden officials have noted that the Trump-era decision to greenlight oil prospecting in most of the reserve was inconsistent with Biden’s climate and environmental goals.

Several environmental groups applauded the Biden administration yesterday for the decision.

“Former President Trump’s last-minute move to strip protections from millions of acres in the Western Arctic Reserve was simply unacceptable,” said Jenny Rowland-Shea, deputy director for public lands at the Center for American Progress. “Returning to the 2013 management plan is the right decision and will restore balance to an area that contains millions of acres of wilderness-quality lands, subsistence resources, and critical habitat for species ranging from caribou to beluga whales.”

But conservationists also urged the Biden administration to more aggressively bar future oil and gas development in the reserve.

“The Western Arctic is the next major front in the fight to address the climate crisis on our nation’s public lands,” said Kristen Miller, conservation director for the Alaska Wilderness League. “The Biden administration should move quickly to put in place durable regulations and protections for the Reserve that recognize the realities of the climate crisis and that are not reliant on which party controls the White House.”

The new record of decision is likely to inflame further political tensions with lawmakers, including the Alaska delegation, who have criticized the Biden administration for not regularly holding oil and gas auctions or supporting fossil fuel development on federal land.

Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) tweeted yesterday that the new IAP blocks significant lands from potential oil production. The president is “not doing all he can to ease gas prices,” he said, a reference to Biden’s promise to address rising energy costs.

While the new IAP technically still allows oil and gas leasing in half of the reserve, the Biden administration has not yet said when, or whether, it will hold oil and gas lease auctions there. Interior has been reticent to hold such lease sales since taking office and has only conducted one auction to date. Several more are scheduled for the summer, but officials have been adamant that they are holding those sales because of a court mandate.

BLM has held a yearly oil auction in the NPR-A since 2010. That streak was broken in 2020, when the Trump administration did not hold an auction due to the pandemic-depressed oil and gas industry.

The NPR-A is the subject of so much interest, in part, because of a proposed massive oil and gas project that would entrench drilling in the reserve for decades.

The reserve, set aside in 1923 by President Warren G. Harding as a potential fuel source for the U.S. Navy, is the largest contiguous block of public land in the country. It constitutes the western side of Alaska’s North Slope, an oil- and gas-rich area that’s been the state’s primary economic resource since drilling in the Prudhoe Bay oil field took off in the 1970s and ’80s.

Little of the historic North Slope oil interest landed in the reserve, but the Biden administration is presiding over a potential reformation of the reserve’s oil prospects due to recent oil discoveries, primarily through its consideration of ConocoPhillips’ $6 billion Willow oil and gas project.

Willow was approved at the tail end of the Trump administration, but that decision was reversed by a federal judge over climate and environmental concerns. The Biden administration is now compiling a supplemental environmental review to address the issues flagged by the court.

Many environmental and Alaska Native organizations are pushing the White House to block Willow and thus stymie expanded drilling in the NPR-A. The project’s supporters, however, have argued that Willow offers long-term energy security to the country and economic certainty for Alaska.",Q2

(Brittany Murray, Press-Telegram/TNS)

(Tribune News Service) — Otis Randle spent his post-high school years, from 1967 to 1971, serving in the U.S. Navy, providing sea support aboard the USS Ranger aircraft carrier while stationed in Vietnam.

He had it easier than others who had to fight the battles on land during what was an especially long and brutal war.

Randle went on to serve as a machine mechanic in the Navy and then worked for the Post Office after his military retirement.

And late last week, just days before Memorial Day, a new generation of U.S. service men and women — sailors and Marines who were part of the 2022 LA Fleet Week festivities in San Pedro — descended on Randle’s South Los Angeles home to repair stucco, replace roofing and generally brighten things up with a new coat of paint.

Along the way, they bonded with each other and earned the gratitude of Randle, 73, and his wife, Elizabeth, 71, who were thrilled by the transformation of the two 1930s-era house Elizabeth’s parents had previously owned.

The repair job on Thursday and Friday, May 26-27, was one of the many off-site projects service men and women participate in during LA Fleet Week, which began in 2016 but was dark in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic.

The workdays were also part of Habitat for Heroes, a program overseen by Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles, that works with other available resource providers for veterans, including Home Depot, to take care of vet-owned homes.

More than 275 veterans and active-duty military members have benefited from the Habitat for Heroes Program, which was founded in 2011 as an outreach to assist military vets with home repairs and renovations.

For many retired homeowners, the need comes as they grapple with the rising expenses of maintaining a house, something they were able to do during their working years but find much tougher with on fixed incomes.

The exercise had a purpose for the young workers as well, said Marine Corps combat videographer Sydney Smith, 22, who participated and documented the process.

The effort encouraged the two branches of the service, she said, to expand their abilities to work together as a team.

“I thought we’d have Team Navy vs. Team Marine,” she said, “but they worked very cohesively together.”

Teams consisted of about 15 workers each day.

Crew members from the USS Essex and USS Portland — both in the Port of Los Angeles for the four-day LA Fleet Week event that wraps up on Memorial Day — pitched in for the workdays, climbing ladders and wielding power washers and paint brushes.

Among the workers was Navy Hospitalman First Class Harold Weinrich, 34, of Beaverton, Oregon,. Weinrich, stationed at Camp Pendleton, said L.A. Fleet Week — the first he’s attended — is a “great way” for service members to interact with the public.

He encouraged the public to stop by the Fleet Week expo area in San Pedro for a visit. Fleet Week continues from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily through Monday at the USS Iowa, 250 S. Harbor Blvd.

It was a year ago, said Elizabeth Randle, that her husband contacted the Habitat program for help on repairs that they calculated would cost something like $30,000 — money the couple simply couldn’t spare now that they were in their retirement years.

She’d seen how older homeowners so often couldn’t keep up with the high cost of repairs and maintenance and didn’t want their homes to be in that state.

The property includes a back house, built in 1932, where a relative will be staying and the front house, built in 1938, where the Randles live. While in basically good shape, the structures were in need of new paint and other repairs, including sealing the windows.

“Everybody is so friendly and nice,” said Elizabeth Randle, who grew up in Hawthorne. “It’s really a blessing. With all the craziness in the world, it’s good to see good people.”

Sergio Morazan, superintendent of the Habitat program, said the goal is to help U.S. veteran families extend the life of their homes while other resources may be found going forward, if needed. That, he said, will help them stay in their own homes.

“We were lucky Fleet Week was here,” Morazan said, adding that this project, about 20 miles from the San Pedro Fleet Week site, was already on the books — at just the right time. Having more workers will help to finish it up sooner, Morazan said.

As for the young workers, he said, they pick up new skills, learn to bond with one another and get lessons on the importance of preserving items that may seem, in their eyes, not worth the effort.

The projects usually take several weeks, Morazan said.

“Little by little, it starts looking fresher and better,” he said of the homes. “And that benefits the whole neighborhood.”

MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama lawmakers approved sweeping legislation Thursday to outlaw gender-affirming medications for transgender kids and advanced a separate measure prohibiting early classroom instruction on sexual and gender identity, a bill critics have dubbed ""Don't Say Gay.""

The Alabama House of Representatives voted 66-28 for legislation to make it a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a doctor to prescribe puberty blockers or hormones or perform surgery to aid in the gender transition of people under age 19. The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature as Alabama becomes the latest red state to promote legislation and policies aimed at trans youth. Ivey has not indicated whether she will sign it.

The topic of transgender and LGBTQ identity has become one of the GOP's ""wedge"" issues aimed at securing votes because they are popular with the party's base.

Rep. Neil Rafferty, the only openly gay member of the Alabama Legislature, appeared to struggle to hold back his anger and maintain composure as lawmakers headed to the vote.

""This is wrong,"" Rafferty said. ""Y'all sit there and campaign on family being the foundation of our nation ... but what this bill is doing is totally undermining that. It's totally undermining family rights, health rights and access to health care.""

Republican Rep. Wes Allen of Troy, sponsor of the House version of the bill, argued during debate Thursday morning that transgender youth are not old enough to make decisions about gender-affirming medication.

""Their brains are not developed to make the decisions long term about what these medications and surgeries do to their body,"" Allen said.

Rep. Chris England, who serves as chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, said the measure targets already vulnerable children and essentially tells them they are not welcome in Alabama.

""You're saying this is about children. It's not. What it is about is scoring political points and using those children as collateral damage,"" England said.

The bill would also require school counselors, nurses and others to tell parents if a child discloses they believe they are transgender.

A spokeswoman for Ivey did not immediately reply to a text message asking if the governor will sign the measure.

""I want the governor to know that she doesn't have to sign this, she can veto it,"" Jeff Walker, whose 15-year-old daughter, Harleigh, is transgender, said Thursday afternoon. ""All you are doing is hurting Alabama families with these bills.""

Arkansas approved a similar law in 2021, but it was put on hold by the courts. Advocacy groups in Alabama have vowed to quickly challenge the measure if Ivey signs it into law.

In a written statement, Chase Strangio, deputy director for Trans Justice with the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the Alabama measure ""the most deadly, sweeping, and hostile law targeting transgender people in the country.""

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday that the U.S. Department of Justice has warned states such laws and policies may violate the Constitution and federal law.

""Today's vote in Alabama will only serve to harm kids,"" she said.

The Alabama Senate advanced separate legislation Thursday related to public school bathrooms and discussions of gender and sexual identity in early grades.

Senators voted 26-5 to approve legislation mandating that K-12 students can only use multiperson bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with the gender on their original birth certificate, rather than their current gender identity.

Republicans in the Senate also added language similar to a law in Florida that critics called the ""Don't Say Gay"" measure.

The Alabama language would ""prohibit classroom instruction or discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity"" for students in kindergarten through the fifth grade.

https://www.liberationnews.org/may-day-san-diego-stands-up-against-racism-classism-imperialism/,"May Day: San Diego stands up against racism, classism, imperialism","On May 1, San Diego workers and community members came out to Chicano Park in the Barrio Logan neighborhood to march the streets of downtown in celebration of May Day, the international workers’ holiday.

The event began with a gathering at Chicano Park, where a number of speakers from various organizations, including the Party for Socialism and Liberation, rallied the people to stand up against racism, classism and imperialism.

Several activist organizations and unions stood together in solidarity for the rights of working people, including Union Del Barrio, Palestinian Youth Movement, Anakbayan, UAW, AFSC and African People’s Socialist Party. Throughout the day’s speeches, each organization made it clear that they had a common enemy — capitalist exploitation.

The theme for the event was “End the war on the working class.” The action placed special emphasis on dignity for all workers, demanding an end to war funding, the domestic war on Black and Brown communities, housing as a human right, critical education and democratic schooling and healthcare for all. “Stop the war on workers,” “We want justice,” “Black power matters,” and other revolutionary chants were heard throughout Chicano Park and the downtown area.

José Cortes of PSL San Diego addressed the crowd right before the march on struggle of workers to get the full value of their labor. Cortes empowered workers to “call for the end of the U.S. war machine” and to “organize to demand an end to capitalist exploitation.” It was a reminder that all the value a worker loses from their labor goes directly into the pockets of those in power, which is in turn used to commit physical and economic violence on individuals, not just in the United States, but across the whole world.

The rally drew a diverse crowd. People of all backgrounds came together despite all their differences for the common struggle against capitalism and the exploitation of workers. To truly win the healthcare, housing, and jobs that workers deserve, we must unite in solidarity and remember that the workers’ struggle has no borders. An injury to one is an injury to all!",Q2
https://www.newser.com/story/321812/vince-mcmahon-paid-millions-in-hush-money-to-staffers-report.html,Vince McMahon Paid Millions in Hush Money to Staffers: Report,"The WWE board of directors is investigating numerous secret nondisclosure agreements involving its chairman Vince McMahon, including a $3 million settlement paid to a former paralegal at the company to cover up an alleged affair. That's according to the Wall Street Journal , which spoke with sources who say the $3 million settlement, inked in January, bars the former employee from discussing her relationship with the CEO or disparaging him. The 12-member board's eight independent directors (excluding McMahon, his daughter Stephanie McMahon, her husband Paul Levesque, and WWE President Nick Khan) began investigating in April following a series of anonymous emails.

Written by a person claiming to be a friend of the paralegal, they claim McMahon increased the woman's salary from $100,000 to $200,000 after beginning a sexual relationship with her, then ""gave her like a toy"" to his trusted associate John Laurinaitis, head of talent relations. The woman, hired in 2019, reportedly became an assistant to Laurinaitis in 2021. ""My friend was so scared so she quit after Vince McMahon and [his longtime attorney Jerry McDevitt] paid her millions of dollars to shut up,"" one email read, per the Journal. A lawyer for McMahon reportedly submitted a copy of the agreement to the board—which has hired law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP to conduct the investigation—on June 12.

The board has since learned of other NDAs involving former female employees who accused McMahon and Laurinaitis of misconduct, and was still collecting details on those as of this week, per the Journal. A WWE rep says the company is fully cooperating with the investigation, adding that McMahon's relationship with the paralegal was consensual. McDevitt tells the Journal that the woman didn't make any harassment claims and the ""WWE did not pay any monies"" to her ""on her departure."" Sources say the 76-year-old McMahon paid using personal funds. ""It's unclear what consequences, if any, McMahon could face given that he functionally owns WWE,"" per the New York Daily News.

Ukrainian officials on Tuesday identified the location of apparent mass graves outside the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol — claims bolstered by the publication of satellite images collected and analyzed by Maxar Technologies.

In a post Thursday on Telegram, Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, wrote: “As a result of a long search and identification of places of mass burial of dead Mariupol residents, we established the fact of arrangement and mass burial of the dead Mariupol residents in the village of Manhush.”

Andriushchenko — who is not in Mariupol but has served as a clearinghouse for information from inside the besieged city — posted the coordinates on Telegram, saying Russian forces had dug several mass graves, each measuring about 30 meters (around 100 feet), in Manhush, a town around 12 miles (about 19 kilometers) to the west of Mariupol.

“Trucks carry in the bodies of the dead, in fact, simply dumping them on the embankment,” he said. “This is direct evidence of war crimes and attempts to cover them up.”

Maxar published analysis of satellite imagery Tuesday appearing to show evidence of new graves at a site on the northwestern edge of Manhush.

An overview of a cemetery and expansion of graves is seen on March 23. (2022 Maxar Technologies)

“According to recent media reports, Russian soldiers have been taking the bodies of people killed in Mariupol to this location,” Maxar said in its analysis. “A review of our satellite images from mid-March through mid-April indicate that the expansion of the new set of graves began between March 23-26, 2022 and has continued to expand over the past couple of weeks. The graves are aligned in four sections of linear rows (measuring approximately 85 meters per section) and contain more than 200 new graves.”

Vadym Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, also alleged Thursday that Russian forces have buried bodies in mass graves in Manhush, amid claims by Ukrainian officials that as many as 20,000 people have died in weeks of bombardment.

“More than 20,000 civilians — women, children, elderly people — died on the streets of our city from enemy artillery, aircraft,” he said. “And this is also [based] on the evidence of the heads of our municipal services, who saw it. And unfortunately, we have seen that the bodies of dead Mariupol residents have begun to disappear from the streets of our city.”

Boichenko said the mass graves were off a bypass road, near a cemetery.

“And there is a field near the cemetery, and in this field there are ditches, 30 meters (about 90 feet) long, and there they bury them, bring the bodies of the dead by trucks and throw them into these ditches,” he said.

CNN cannot independently verify claims that Russians have disposed of bodies in mass graves at that location, and a firm death toll following weeks of heavy bombardment of Mariupol is not available. Journalists in Mariupol have documented the hasty burial of civilians in the besieged city, and images have surfaced on social media showing bodies apparently left for collection in the city.

Evidence of mass graves outside Mariupol surfaced as Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed the “liberation” of the city by Russian forces, although he also called off an attempt to storm the Azovstal steel plant, the final bastion of Ukrainian defenders inside the city, where civilians have also sheltered.

“Unfortunately, it is not possible today to evacuate civilians from Azovstal,” Boichenko said. “Because we are asking for a stable ceasefire. Somewhere we need one day to be able to accommodate those residents who have been hiding there for 57 days in a row, and they are being bombed, bombed and bombed.”

Boichenko estimated that around 100,000 people remain in Mariupol.",Q2

https://www.theepochtimes.com/how-ancient-greek-mathematician-archimedes-discovered-the-magic-of-pi_4396319.html,How Ancient Greek Mathematician Archimedes Discovered the Magic of Pi,"Archimedes was a scientist we studied in fifth grade for no other reason than to introduce my students to the wonderful world of pi. What does he have to do with pi? You haven’t heard the story? Well, sit back and let me tell you. He is one of my all-time favorite historical characters!

Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, scientist, engineer, and inventor from the town of Syracuse on the island of Sicily. You may know Sicily as a part of the country Italy, but that was not always so. Long ago, this island belonged to Greece, and it was at that time that Archimedes lived there.

Archimedes was famous for his many inventions and discoveries. Everyone on the island knew of his brilliance. He invented many of the tools and contraptions the Greeks were using to fight a war with the Romans (the Italians of long ago). Archimedes used the formula for area in all of his contraptions, but when it came to circular objects, he was stumped.

One day, Archimedes discovered that if you divided the circumference of a circle by its diameter you would come up with the same approximate number every time. He was sure the first three digits of the number were 3.14, but after that his calculations became fuzzy. Archimedes was a mathematician, a scientist! Fuzzy was not good enough. He must find the exact number that is derived from dividing the circumference of a circle by its diameter. If he could do that, he knew he would be able to find the exact area of a circle.

Suddenly, all of his work stopped. He quit inventing things. He stopped discovering things. He lost his curiosity for all things except for his new obsession of discovering the true value of pi. He spent hours, then days, then months drawing circles in the sand. He drew other shapes like octagons and even decagons inside the circles to help him find the answer.

One day, a group of villagers came to Archimedes and started yelling, “Run, Archimedes, run! The Romans are coming! Take cover immediately!”

Archimedes was nonplussed. “I will be there in a few minutes. I must finish this circle. I am so close to an answer. I may just have discovered pi.”

His friends were frantic. “Archimedes, you must forget about pi! The Romans are on the other side of that hill. They will be here any moment! You must come with us. You are in grave danger!”

“Soon,” said Archimedes. “Go on without me. I will meet you soon. I must finish this one circle and this last calculation.”

The villagers looked at him in horror, but they knew there was no use. They turned and ran. Within minutes, the Romans came over the hill and killed Archimedes. It was said that his last dying breath was, “Don’t disturb those circles…”

Are you intrigued by this story? My fifth graders were! Is the story true? Perhaps parts of it are true, but I am not really sure. Archimedes was born in 287 B.C. and died—well, I’m not really sure when he died, but it was probably some 200 years B.C. Somewhere in a book, I read a very short version of this story decades ago. I wish I could give credit, but I’m really not sure where I read it. I do remember that the book said no one is sure if the story is true or not. Regardless, I took that story, added a bit of theater and embellishment, and suddenly my students wanted to know everything they could about Archimedes and about the number pi.

Another way I drew my students into my pi world was by having the digits of pi as a number line wrapping around the walls of my classroom. By fifth grade, my students didn’t really need their ABCs or a number line anymore, so they had 3.1415926535897… to stare at day after day after day. Usually, the first week of school, at least one student would ask me, “What are those numbers for?”

I would tell them, “Those are the digits of pi. You really won’t learn much about them until March, when we have a special day celebrating those digits called Pi Day. There will be a memorization contest, so if you want to start memorizing them now, feel free.” And some did. When students finished their work or a test, I would often see them staring at the numbers, and I could tell they were reciting them in their head. It always made me smile.

The thing is, memorizing pi is really the smallest part of our Pi Day celebration. Of course, we have a pi digit memorization contest. For some students, this is their spelling bee. For some students, this is where they shine. Is there a trophy? Not really. The winner gets something even better. The winner of the pi memorization contest gets a pie in his or her face, and I (their teacher) get the honor of putting it there! To a fifth grader, there is no better prize!

So, what is Pi Day? Pi Day takes place on March 14, because it is the fourteenth day of the third month of the year. March is also synonymous with preparing for state testing. Little do my students know I use Pi Day as a preparation tool for this test. We haven’t reached the geometry unit in our math textbook by this time, but there is plenty of geometry on the test.

Fifth graders are not required to know how to find the area of a circle, but they are required to find the area of a square, a rectangle, and a triangle. I teach them how to find the area of a circle. I teach them how to read a formula. Then I backtrack and teach them how to use those skills to find the area of other shapes. After learning about pi and circles, this is “a piece of cake.”

I use a PowerPoint that I created in 2006 (still relevant today) to teach them about pi, Archimedes, vocabulary, geometry, and formulas. You can find the presentation at PiDayWithMrsAbernethys5thGradeClass.BlogSpot.com . If you go there, give it plenty of time to load. There are years and years of a variety of projects posted there. Trust me, it’s worth your time.

There is also a song I use to teach them about pi. I usually start playing the song early in the year, and I play it while students are getting ready for math or at the end of the day or when the kids beg me to play it. The song is on YouTube; it is called “Mathematical Pi,” and it’s written to the tune of “American Pie.” Not only do the kids love it, there are lots of vocabulary words in the song ripe for student discovery.

By the beginning of March, students are primed and ready to prepare for the magical day. Students are given the choice to work on their own, work with a partner, or work with a group. Their job is to create a presentation for Pi Day. What kind of presentation, you ask? Whatever kind they want! The possibilities are endless, and their only restraint is that the topic must in some way connect to pi.

Next, students create invitations to give to parents, grandparents, and family members. Students who finish their projects early begin decorating the classroom for the big day with geometric shapes, formulas, pi symbols, pi facts, and more. One year, we even had a 7-foot Pi Day tree.

Illustrations by R.W.

When the big day arrives, each student brings a pie to school. I bring a few extra, just in case, but they are usually not needed. Students put the finishing touches on the classroom. We rearrange the room so we have room for our guests to sit down, and we use the desks as serving tables for the pie. We set up a coffee and juice station, and students rehearse their presentations.

The projects are out of this world. Students have written songs; some are playing their band instruments as background music; some have created plays about Archimedes’ life; one student made a quilt (the squares colored to represent the digits of pi); some students have created videos; others have created PowerPoint presentations; one student has done a research project on Albert Einstein because his birthday is on Pi Day.

At 1:45, we open our door and family pours in. Two students pass out a program that a group of students created. Others usher the adults to their seats. The American Pie song and video called “Mathematical Pi” is playing on the whiteboard, and all of the kids are singing. There is one table in the front of the room with one pie, and a knife.

At 1:55, I stand in the front of the room to welcome our guests. This is the only time I will speak. I explain to the parents that we are celebrating the day because pi equals approximately 3.14 and today is the 14th day of the third month. I then explain that the next three digits are 159, so we will have the formal pie cutting ceremony at 1:59. A student stands by with an iPad and a digital countdown. We all count down as I raise the knife and cut the pie! After this, the students serve their family pie, and the presentations begin.

My wish is that someone who reads this will pick up this tradition with his or her children. Tell them the story of Archimedes. Teach them the magic of numbers. Most of all, share pie with them on March 14!

https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/billy-chemirmir-found-guilty-in-texas-serial-killings-will-spend-rest-of-his-life-in-prison,"Billy Chemirmir found guilty in Texas serial killings, will spend rest of his life in prison","DALLAS — A Dallas County jury Thursday, April 28, found a suspected serial killer guilty of capital murder. Police say Billy Chemirmir preyed on elderly women in Dallas and Collin counties.

Chemirmir, who showed no visible reaction to the verdict, will spend the rest of his life in prison and could face additional trials. Police say Chemirmir smothered at least two dozen elderly women over two years, stealing their jewelry and other precious items. But jurors only heard about attacks on three women, and found Chemirmir is guilty of killing one of them, Lu Thi Harris.

The 81-year-old was found dead in her Dallas home in March 2018, after Chemirmir was arrested with jewelry and other items that belonged to her. The other two women are Mary Brooks, whose death in January 2018 was initially thought to be of natural causes but was changed after Chemirmir’s arrest, and Mary Bartel, who survived an attack in her retirement community apartment the day before Harris was killed.

Chemirmir, who has maintained he is innocent, did not testify. Chemirmir is a Kenyan immigrant with permanent resident status in the U.S. He stood with his arms crossed in front of him as state District Judge Raquel “Rocky” Jones sentenced him to life without the possibility of parole. Chemirmir patted one of his attorneys, Mark Watson, on the arm before being taken back to jail.

He is found guilty of capital murder and will spend rest of his life in prison. Shafkat Anowar/The Dallas Morning News/TNS

Family members of the women Chemirmir is accused of killing erupted in cheers after he was lead out of the courtroom. Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who helped prosecute the case, sniffed and blinked back tears. He said that the DA’s office will next prosecute Chemirmir in Brooks’ slaying.

This is the second time a Dallas County jury has considered the case. A trial in November ended in a mistrial after one juror refused to budge, according to notes sent to the judge from that jury. This week, jurors heard testimony over four days.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys rested their cases in the new trial Thursday morning and presented their closing statements in the afternoon. The jury began deliberations about 3:33 p.m. Chemirmir’s attorneys said they have already filed a notice they will appeal.

Chemirmir was automatically be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole because prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. Jurors may also consider the charge of theft.

Circumstantial case

The new jury heard much of the same evidence that jurors heard in November.

The case against Chemirmir is circumstantial, prosecutors have said. But they believe the totality of the evidence shows Chemirmir had a pattern of smothering elderly women and stealing their jewelry to sell for profit.

“This idea that circumstantial evidence equals weak evidence is stuff of movies and books ... but it’s not real,” Creuzot said to jurors in closing arguments.

Jurors saw video surveillance footage from a Walmart on Coit and Arapaho roads on three separate days, including the day of Harris’ death.

On that day, March 20, 2018, the video shows Chemirmir and Harris in the store at the same time.

Defense lawyers challenged the video evidence by pointing out Harris arrived at Walmart nearly 40 minutes before Chemirmir and footage does not appear to show the two to speak with each other. Chemirmir drove out of the parking lot about two minutes before Harris, defense lawyer Kobby Warren pointed out.

Prosecutors sought to prove Chemirmir had a pattern of choosing victims at Walmart. Surveillance footage from another day showed Chemirmir standing outside the same Walmart in dark slacks, a white shirt and a blue tie with a phone to his ear, watching the parking lot intently. But a cell phone analyst testified that Chemirmir’s phone showed no record of incoming or outgoing calls during the time he loitered in the Walmart, suggesting that he pretended to be on the phone.

Prosecutors also showed Walmart footage from Jan. 30 – the day Mary Brooks was killed. A silver Nissan Altima parked next to Brooks’ car but the driver never got out. The car, which resembled the one Chemirmir drove, left when Brooks did. The footage never showed a license plate number or the driver.

Under prosecutors’ questioning, the cell phone analyst testified that Chemirmir’s records placed him in the area of the Walmart at the same time. But defense lawyers tried to cast doubt on the reliability of cell phone towers and the large swath of area they cover.

The defense’s strategy was also similar to the last trial. Defense lawyers Kobby Warren and Phillip Hayes cross examined the state’s witnesses more often, but like in the first trial they did not make an opening statement and they did not call any witnesses.

“In a criminal case, the most important thing that the state has to do is prove to you all that the person they’re accusing was at the scene ... They can’t place him there,” Warren said in closing arguments of Harris’ house.

Differences in strategy

Much about the two trials was the same. But prosecutors changed the order of witnesses and did not show some evidence that was a major part of the last trial.

The case they presented this week was largely chronological, placing witnesses in an order that showed how the investigation developed from the attack on Bartel, to Chemirmir’s arrest, to the discovery of Harris’ body, to the reinvestigation of Brooks’ death.

There were also subtle differences in how evidence was presented to jurors, like when lead prosecutor Glen Fitzmartin showed a photograph of Harris on a projector. The prosecutor then laid jewelry on top of the photo that Chemirmir had when he was arrested to show how it matched the items Harris wore in the photo.

“All of this stuff is actually not stuff. It’s evidence. It’s evidence of the guilt of Billy Chemirmir in the death of Lu Thi Harris,” Fitzmartin said forcefully in his closing argument. The prosecutor walked to the opposite side of the table where Chemirmir sat, looked down at him and pointed his finger.

Prosecutors did not show jurors video of Chemirmir’s interview with police officers from Dallas and Plano the night he was arrested.

Shafkat Anowa/The Dallas Morning News/TNS

In that hours long video watched by the first jury, Chemirmir denied involvement in either women’s deaths. He remained polite throughout the interview, and appeared surprised to be accused of murder. He told police he thought he was being questioned for an outstanding warrant for public intoxication.

“I just can’t believe this,” Chemirmir said. “Where I come from, our culture, we don’t even think about that. ... I didn’t murder anybody.”

Prosecutors might not have chosen to play the video in the re-trial because it created doubt in jurors’ minds that Chemirmir was guilty, said Robbie McClung, a defense lawyer and former prosecutor not involved in the case.

Defense lawyers attempted to get the video in, to no avail. Rules that lawyers must abide by prevent the defense from entering what is considered a self-serving statement because it takes away the prosecution’s ability to cross-examine the person.

“I think that was probably the downfall for them the last time. I think that’s what hung the jury,” McClung said. “It left some of the jurors wondering ‘Could it possibly be that he didn’t do it and we’ve got the wrong person?’” McClung said.

“That was a strategic move. The only way he would get his story out is if he took the stand,” McClung said.

Looking ahead

On the heels of the November mistrial, Creuzot said his office was committed to trying Chemirmir for the deaths of Harris and Brooks.

Collin County prosecutors also have five indictments against Chemirmir for deaths there. Creuzot said he and Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis agreed Dallas County will try its cases first.

After Creuzot said last year he would not seek the death penalty, lawmakers and families of Chemirmir’s alleged victims called on Willis to do so. The Collin County DA’s office has declined to comment on the case.

Brian Keith Easterling, 52, was taken into custody earlier Monday at his home in Holt, Florida and was awaiting extradition from the nearby county of Okaloosa, the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office said. He was charged with premeditated murder, the sheriff's office said in a news release.

Easterling is chief of the Baker Fire District, a volunteer fire department in the Florida Panhandle. The Baker Fire District said it would release a statement later.

https://wabx.net/2022/06/06/judge-delays-trial-of-two-officers-charged-in-george-floyd-murder/,Judge delays trial of two officers charged in George Floyd murder,"(Reuters) – A Minnesota judge on Monday delayed until next year the trial of two former Minneapolis police officers charged in the murder of George Floyd, citing the need to ensure fair proceedings.

Hennepin County district court judge Peter Cahill ruled that the trial for J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, which was scheduled to start this month, is now set for January 5, 2023. The pair are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Cahill wrote in his ruling that media coverage of the defendants’ guilty verdict in a federal civil rights trial in February, along with coverage of the guilty plea of co-defendant and former officer Thomas Lane in May, would make for an unfair trial this month. Lane pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter.

Kueng, Thao and Lane all watched as fellow officer Derek Chauvin murdered Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes in May 2020. Chauvin was found guilty last year and sentenced to over 22 years in prison. Floyd’s murder ignited global protests calling for racial justice and police accountability.

Cahill ruled on Monday against defendants’ request for a change of venue, and denied the request from media to allow cameras or audio recording devices in the courtroom.

In response to Cahill’s decision, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in an emailed statement that “it’s unfortunate for the victims, the witnesses, and community that the opportunity to seek justice has been delayed.”

WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) – Nearly a dozen people and their pets have been displaced after an apartment fire in Wilmington on Sunday.

The fire at an apartment building on Mill Creek Court on Sunday has officially been ruled accidental by the Fire Marshal’s office. The fire was caused by improperly discarded smoking materials. One person was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation, 11 other residents, and their pets were displaced.

Cally Edwards with the American Red Cross says the organization is helping those evacuated from their homes.

“When we come to the house fire that night, as the fire truck are starting to roll away, our responders are on scene meeting with those families, and a lot of people don’t realize that that’s what the red cross does each and every day. Especially here in eastern North Carolina,” said Cally Edwards, Eastern NC, American Red Cross communications director.

They are the helping the displaced residents with shelter, food, toiletries, and health services.

“They are meeting with the effected individuals and families and discussing what their immediate needs are and how the Red Cross can help,” said Edwards.

Mental health services are also being provided, as the displaced residents recover from the disaster of the fire.

“None of these people thought it would happen to them yesterday, either, and it did, and so we actually have volunteers that are mental health trained volunteers, that are available to help speak with the families about that emotional support that they might need in the days ahead as they make this transition to their new normal,” said Edwards.

Fire officials say the person who was taken to the hospital was trapped on the second-floor balcony, along with their two pets. That person is expected to recover.",Q2

Wade.

Emily Bisek, vice president of strategic communications for the Planned Parenthood North Central States, said the clinic in Sioux Falls is still open to patients for the other forms of care it offers, like birth control, IUDs and family planning, but not abortion.

""We can't in good faith schedule patients for abortions when they would have to go out of state anyway,"" Bisek told the Argus Leader on Wednesday afternoon, noting that because of many laws already set in South Dakota, it takes multiple appointments to get an abortion.

Patients seeking abortions at this time are notified that Planned Parenthood in Sioux Falls is pausing that form of care because if Roe v. Wade is overturned by SCOTUS soon — Bisek noted the health care provider is expecting a decision between now and June 30 — South Dakota's trigger law would go into effect.

The trigger law will immediately outlaw abortion in South Dakota, but abortion is still safe and legal in Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota, Bisek noted, among other states.

Bisek said Planned Parenthood can help patients in South Dakota get appointments at another health center as needed.

Minnesota could see up to a 25% increase in demand, short-term spike in Iowa

The unavailability of abortion services in South Dakota is expected to increase demand for those services in surrounding states. Based on the available data projections, Planned Parenthood North Central State's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Sarah Traxler, says they are expecting a 5-to-25% increase in demand for abortion services at Minnesota's abortion clinic locations alone.

""That's based on a [national] projection that only about 50% of those people who need an abortion would actually have the ability to travel,"" Traxler told the Argus Leader.

That means the other half doesn't have the means to travel, and are left with the option of continuing a pregnancy or finding a way to self-manage one.

In the short-term, Traxler says an uptick at the Sioux City clinic is also likely, with more than 70% of patients at the Iowa clinic already South Dakota residents.

But news out of Iowa is also putting that option in doubt, as the Iowa Supreme Court will issue its ruling Friday in a closely-watched decision that could govern the future of abortion access in the state, according to the Des Moines Register.

That court is considering the constitutionality of a 2018 Iowa Supreme Court decision that blocked a 72-hour waiting period. If both Roe and the Iowa 2018 precedent are overturned, legislators would be able to ban some or all abortions in the state.",Q2

Kenneth Pilon, 61, has been charged with six counts of interfering with federally protected activities for incidents dating back to June and July 2020 — which is when the wave of nationwide protests began after the murder of George Floyd.

Floyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, when Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, ultimately killing him.

Pilon allegedly called nine Starbucks stores across Michigan, telling workers that answered his calls to tell the employees wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts that ""the only good n***er is a dead n***er,"" according to the criminal complaint filed this week.

Pilon is also accused of telling one of the employees, ""I'm gonna go out and lynch me a n*****.""

Utah State officials announced Tuesday that Utah will be receiving $266 million, over a period of 18 years, from a settlement agreement from a lawsuit filed by Utah counties against pharmaceutical companies.

It’s a partial settlement with one drug manufacturer and a few distributors. Half the money will go directly to the state.

“The remaining $133 million will be split between the 27 settling counties,” said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. “And the Salt Lake County share of that is roughly about $57 million which we’ll be able to reinvest back into our county for drug treatment and the collateral impacts of this that we are suffering from.”

Officials say it’s just a start of what they believe will be additional, successful settlements with pharmaceutical companies, to combat the devastation caused by the over-prescription of synthetic opioids.

The money will be spent to start new treatment facilities, hire therapists, promote drug education and deal with the related impacts on the criminal justice system, says a statement released by Salt Lake County.

Original Publication Date April 07, 2022 - 12:31 AM

ISTANBUL (AP) — A Turkish court decided Thursday to transfer the trial of 26 Saudis accused in the gruesome killing of Jamal Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, raising fears that those responsible for the death of the Washington Post columnist won't be brought to justice for a crime that drew international outrage.

The decision, which comes as Ankara is trying to repair relations with Saudi Arabia, was denounced as “scandalous” by a human rights group. It marked an abrupt reversal for Turkey, which had vowed to shed light on the killing and began prosecuting the defendants in absentia in 2020.

Khashoggi, a United States resident who wrote critically about Saudi Crown Prince Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed Oct. 2, 2018, at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. He had gone into the consulate for an appointment to collect documents required for him to marry his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, and never came out.

Turkish officials alleged that Khashoggi was killed and dismembered with a bone saw inside the consulate by a team of Saudi agents sent to Istanbul. The group included a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince’s office. His remains have not been found.

The Istanbul court's decision comes despite warnings from human rights groups that turning the case over to the kingdom would lead to a cover-up of the killing, which has cast suspicion on the crown prince.

Last week, the prosecutor in the case recommended its transfer to the kingdom, arguing that the trial in Turkey would remain inconclusive. Turkey’s justice minister supported the recommendation, adding that the trial in Turkey would resume if the Istanbul court is not satisfied with the outcome in Saudi Arabia.

It was not clear if the kingdom, which has already put some of the defendants on trial behind closed doors, would open a new trial, and there was no immediate reaction from Riyadh to the decision.

At Thursday’s hearing, lawyers representing Cengiz asked the court not to move the proceedings to Saudi Arabia, the private DHA news agency reported.

“Let’s not entrust the lamb to the wolf,” the agency quoted lawyer Ali Ceylan as telling the court. “Let’s protect the honor and dignity of the Turkish nation.”

But the court halted the trial in line with the Justice Ministry’s “positive opinion,” DHA reported. It also decided to lift arrest warrants issued against the defendants and gave the sides seven days to lodge any opposition.

Saudi Arabia had rejected Turkey's requests to extradite the defendants, who included two former aides of the prince.

Some of the men were put on trial in Riyadh behind closed doors. A Saudi court issued a final verdict in 2020 that sentenced five midlevel officials and operatives to 20-year jail terms. The court had originally ordered the death penalty, but reduced the punishment after Khashoggi’s son, Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, announced he forgave them. Three others were sentenced to lesser jail terms.

At the time of the killing, Turkey apparently had the Saudi Consulate bugged and shared audio of the killing with the CIA, among others.

The slaying sparked international condemnation. Western intelligence agencies, as well as the U.S. Congress, said an operation of such magnitude could not have happened without the knowledge of the crown prince.

Human rights advocates had also urged Turkey not to transfer the case to Saudi Arabia, arguing that justice for Khashoggi would not be delivered by Saudi courts.

“It’s a scandalous decision,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, the Turkey director for the New York-based Human Rights Watch, asserting that the court had “rubber-stamped” a political decision that would allow the Turkish government to repair its ties with Saudi Arabia.

“In the interest of realpolitik, Turkey is ready to sacrifice justice for an egregious crime on its own soil,” she told The Associated Press. “(The decision) opens the way for other countries to commit assassinations on Turkish territory and get away with it.”

Cengiz said she would continue to seek justice.

“We will continue this (judicial) process with all the power given to me, as a Turkish citizen,” she told reporters outside the courthouse.

“The two countries may be making an agreement, the two countries may be opening a new chapter ... but the crime is still the same crime,” she said. “The people who committed the crime haven’t changed. Governments and states must have a principled stance.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists also criticized the decision.

“The Turkish government’s trial of Jamal Khashoggi’s suspected killers was politicized from the start, but the decision to transfer his case to Saudi Arabia extinguishes any hope of reaching an impartial conclusion based on the evidence,” said Justin Shilad, CPJ's senior researcher for the Middle East and North Africa.

“The international community must pursue a credible and transparent investigation into Khashoggi’s murder, and should not allow political expediency or interference to derail justice,"" Shilad said.

Turkey, which is in a deep economic downturn, has been trying to improve its strained relationship with Saudi Arabia and an array of other countries in the region. Some media reports have claimed that Riyadh has made improved relations conditional on Turkey dropping the case, which had inflamed tensions between two countries.

The move would pave the way to a resolution of disputes between the two regional heavyweights since the 2011 Arab Spring, including Turkey’s support for Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood, which Riyadh considers a terrorist group. Turkey also sided with Qatar in a diplomatic dispute that saw Doha boycotted by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

70-year-old Marcus Jacobson was convicted on two counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty by a Whitman County District Court jury last week. The case involved two dying cows on Jacobson’s ranch on State Route 26 near LaCrosse.

Judge John Hart sentenced Jacobson on Friday. Judge Hart banned Jacobson from owning, possessing, caring for or residing with animals as required by state law for someone convicted of animal cruelty.

Jacobson is scheduled to be back in court on July 1st. If he still has cattle Jacobson will be sent to the Whitman County Jail for two years. If he no longer has cattle Jacobson will remain a free man. The Whitman County Sheriff’s Office will be confirming whether or not Jacobson still has cows.

Opinion Contributor

My former student Quintez Brown appeared in federal court recently. Leg irons clanked as he shuffled into the room. The formerly handsome, curious and kindhearted boy who lit up my office with laughter over the years now sat before me bedraggled, staring blankly into space with flat affect. I thought, “My God. What has happened to this young man?” I cried.

There we were, hearing the case of the United States v. Quintez Brown. I wasn’t sure how we got there. In a city where the federal government refused to intervene when Breonna Taylor was killed by agents of the state and many people didn’t trust the state to legitimately prosecute her killers, the United States was now vigorously going after young, mentally unbalanced Quintez Brown.

Brown’s lead attorney, Rob Eggert, had argued from the beginning of the case that Brown is “severely mentally ill” and belongs in a treatment facility, not a jail. Psychiatric experts agree. Brown was committed to a mental institution for a time after he was initially bailed out after state charges were levied against him. A psychiatrist there testified that he suffered from “major depressive disorder.” Another psychiatrist diagnosed Brown with “bipolar disorder with thoughts of suicide.”

The United States didn’t care. Brown and his family followed the rules of home incarceration to the letter, but that didn’t stop the United States from dramatically seizing him from his grandmother’s home. A helicopter was even dispatched to hover overhead for good measure. They indicted him on federal charges that carry a mandatory minimum of 10 years to life in prison.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Assistant U.S. attorney Amanda Gregory and her co-counsel Jolee Porter sought to make the case that Brown wasn’t mentally ill at all, but rather a cold and calculating “radicalized” assassin. They pulled out all the stops. They painted him as “against democracy” and a believer in violence. Gregory grotesquely twisted quotes from Huey Newton cited by Brown in one of his writings to make her point.

When challenged, it was clear she hadn’t read Newton. But that didn’t matter to her.

Gregory zeroed in on Brown’s written observations that Blacks in America were politically, economically and socially disempowered and the two-party system hadn’t changed those dynamics. She dismissed the truth of that argument and continued to demonize Brown. She did so with absolutely no awareness of her surroundings.

There she stood in a courtroom with a young, mentally ill Black boy in shackles, oblivious to the fact that he was the only dark piece on the chessboard. The prosecutors representing the United States, white. The defense attorneys, white (because Black people often feel most Black attorneys won’t receive the same respect when push comes to shove). The bailiff, white. The security at the doors, white. The court reporter, white. The judge, white. Yet Gregory persisted, seemingly giving her contradictions no thought.

The United States dispatched Gregory and Porter to send Quintez Brown away for a very long time, not to have empathy. To be sure, outside the courtroom, some people don’t think ANY of us should have an ounce of concern for Brown and they have been alarmingly aggressive about it.

When I told a friend I was writing this piece she repeatedly warned, “PLEASE be careful!” One of my older fraternity brothers sent a note, “Be careful, my brother. Don’t let Brown take you down.” There have been a number of “concerned” contacts from people who have said in one way or another, “You need to keep your distance from Quintez Brown.”

Be careful, indeed.

When this incident initially occurred, Louisville Police Chief Erika Shields intimated that the shooting may have happened because “Mr. Greenberg is Jewish.” To this day, there is no evidence of that, but the narrative has taken hold. Now, claims of antisemitism are flying fast and furiously. Not only is Brown cast as an antisemite, so are those of us who have any modicum of affection for him.

More from Ricky Jones:What happened to the brilliant Quintez Brown? | Opinion

Is this what it’s come to? Are we to live in fear of professional and social ruin because we have compassion for a clearly mentally unhinged individual and his poor family lost in a sea of grief? Can we not simultaneously balance sympathy for Craig Greenberg, empathy for Quintez Brown and love for them both?

Can I be so casually demonized as anti-Jewish, not just by the faceless on social media, but also by prominent people who have never taken the time to speak to me, because I have concern for my student and want to know what destroyed the mind of a young man for whom I had such high hopes?

Can a Black friend of mine who has unfailingly shown individual and collective love and support for our Jewish brothers and sisters now be so quickly labeled antisemitic because she supports a Black candidate for mayor instead of Craig Greenberg?

Is that what it has come to? Or is that the way it’s always been, and we simply didn’t know it? I’m beginning to wonder. I’m wondering about that and more.

After Quintez Brown’s initial release, Sen. Mitch McConnell railed on the floor of the U.S. Senate that a “left-wing bail fund partnered with BLM” to post his bond. He fumed, “Less than 48 hours after this activist tried to literally murder a politician, the radical left bailed their comrade out of jail. It is just jaw-dropping. The innocent people of Louisville deserve better.”

Later, McConnell would call the idea that he had influenced the federal government’s decision to intervene in the case “laughable.” That’s not laughable, it’s actually quite reasonable. But several other claims pushed by the United States are, indeed, laughable.

Joe Gerth:Quintez Brown case shows need for bail reform and greater mental health services

They characterize Quintez Brown as a gunsmith who brushed up on his skills at a firing range before attempting to kill Greenberg. He was such an adept gun handler that he loaded a bullet into his weapon backward. Brown was such a deft assassin that he stood within a few feet of an unsuspecting man, fired repeatedly... and missed with every shot.

Quintez Brown did not suffer from mental challenges at all. In fact, he was so lucid and calculating that his master plan was to arrive at a building unmasked in broad daylight on a Bird scooter, kill a man and call a Lyft for his getaway car. That’s totally sane.

U.S. attorney Amanda Gregory took the Brown as master assassin storyline even farther in her closing. She argued before the court that if Brown was released there was a danger of him “completing the job” and even theorized that he may have been developing plans to kill another candidate. In his hearing summation, Magistrate Judge Colin Lindsay called that particular extrapolation “absurd.”

Be clear, I and others have repeatedly said if Quintez Brown did what he’s accused of doing, he was wrong. There is no quibbling about that. And thank God Craig Greenberg was not harmed. But those of us who care about Quintez want to know why he did it and what happened to this poor boy’s mind. We want him to be helped. Folks on the other side don’t care about that. They simply want this young man thrown on the scrap heap of humanity.

The United States is prosecuting Quintez Brown, literally. They don’t care about context, his mental state, or potential. They don’t care if he ever sees the light of day again. They don’t want to rehabilitate him. They don’t want to simply punish him. They seem hellbent on crucifying him, possibly sending him away for life and forgetting him. And I don’t think that’s right.

At the end of the hearing to decide whether to release Quintez to home incarceration again, the judge sent word asking if I would serve as his co-third-party custodian along with his grandmother. Yes, that carries responsibilities and comes at some legal and financial risk for me if things go wrong. And yes, I agreed without hesitation. I’m not sure if the judge would have ruled in Quintez’s favor had I not.

I am sure that I had no choice after I looked at his family. His mother, father and stepmother were worried and in tears. His grandmother sat crestfallen and obviously prayerful. She reminded me of my own grandmother who raised me in the largely hopeless housing projects of Atlanta after my mother gave birth to me at 15 and my father was nowhere to be found. And here I was, that poor Black boy now, grown into a relatively accomplished man who was in a position to help. I knew my grandmother would have wanted somebody to help me if my life had spiraled out of control and was laid prostrate before the authorities.

So, yes – I helped! People who have warned me may be right and I may suffer for it somehow. But I swear before God almighty that I’d do it again!

https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/florida-judge-rules-that-15-week-abortion-ban-is-unconstitutional,Florida judge rules that 15-week abortion ban is unconstitutional,"A Florida judge said he would temporarily block a 15-week abortion ban from taking effect, following a court challenge by reproductive health providers who say the state constitution guarantees a right to the procedure. Judge John C. Cooper made the ruling from the bench on Thursday and said he would soon sign the temporary injunction.

The law was supposed to go into effect on July 1. Florida’s 15-week abortion ban was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis this spring. Judge Cooper, however, said his verbal ruling will not be binding until he signs a written order. That written order could come Tuesday morning.

Cooper drew a distinction between the state constitutional issues in the Florida case and the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last week that struck down the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling.

""I do think that this order complies with the present state of the law in Florida. And we all know that Roe v. Wade was reversed about a week ago. And the only mention Roe v. Wade should get in this particular case … is that it has indicated the (U.S.) Supreme Court (said) that these decisions are to be made at the state level. That’s what this proceeding is about, is construing a provision of the Florida Constitution,"" Cooper said.





The privacy clause has played a key role for more than three decades in bolstering abortion rights in Florida. Cooper’s ruling drew reactions from numerous political leaders on both sides of the abortion debate.

Rep. Anna Eskamani tweeted immediately after the judge's decision:

""Judge rules that HB5, FL's 15 week abortion ban, is unconstitutional and violates the privacy provision of the State Constitution & he supports a temporary statewide injunction. His order will not happen until he signs it. An important win for abortion rights in FL.""

""Today’s ruling on pro-life HB 5 is disappointing but not unexpected. This issue will need to be resolved in the (Florida Supreme Court), where I hope to see a correct interpretation of the state's privacy clause & HB 5 implemented statewide to save tens of thousands of innocent babies' lives,"" House Speaker Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor, said in a tweet.

Advocacy groups asked the judge Monday to stop the law following last week's Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. One of the big problems advocates have with the new law is its lack of exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest. The judge is set to rule on the case on Thursday.

Under the new law, women could've faced up to 5 years in prison for having an abortion after 15 weeks and doctors could be fined $10,000. Under current law, Florida allows abortions up to 24 weeks.





Abortion rights advocates were in a Tallahassee courtroom this week in an attempt to stop the new law. The legal challenge is that Florida’s constitution guarantees a broad right to privacy.

MORE NEWS: These new Florida laws go into effect on Friday

Opponents say it is up to the state to decide – and they did that by passing the law. Last week, the Supreme Court ended federal protections for abortions.

""We lobbied very heavily for the 15-week abortion ban in the legislature,"" said Andrew Shirvell with Florida Voice for the Unborn. ""It’s clearly the will of the people, through their elected representatives.""

One doctor took the stand to say the changes could put women at risk.

""Women and girls who need abortions after 15 weeks are those that tend to have the most challenging and compelling life circumstances,"" Dr. Shelly Tien with Planned Parenthood said.

According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 2% of the nearly 72,000 abortions reported in Florida in 2019 were performed after 15 weeks. Data shows the majority of abortions in the state of Florida occur before the 15-week cutoff time.

https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/04/18/habermas-on-the-kantian-vision-of-perpetual-peace/,Habermas on the Kantian Vision of Perpetual Peace,"Habermas develops his own vision of a post-national constellation in intricate dialogue with Kant in a series of articles from 1998 to 2012. To begin, I will explicate key ideas in his seminal essay written in 2000, “Kant’s idea of perpetual peace at two hundred years’ historical remove.” The occasion for the writing of Kant’s essay was Frederick William II’s withdrawal from the War of the First Coalition in March of 1795 and Kant’s desire to jump into a lengthy debate addressing the issue of perpetual peace (Leibniz, Voltaire, Frederick the Great and Rousseau). A leading Kant scholar, Allen Wood (Basic writings on Kant [2001]), informs us that: “It is perhaps Kant’s most genuine attempt to address a universal enlightened public concerning issues of importance not only to scientists and philosophers but vital as well to all humanity” (p. xxii).

Kant’s program for peace

To set out logically Kant’s exciting (and controversial) program for perpetual peace, Habermas defines Kant’s goal for the “sought-for-‘lawful condition’” (p. 166), describes the actual project, discusses the appropriate legal forms of a federation of nations and queries whether the “philosophy of history” remains a convincing solution. For Kant, the primary goal is the abolition of war: “There is to be no war,” and the “heinous waging of War” must come to an end. While not focusing explicitly on the victims of war, Kant accords primary importance to the “horrors of violence” and the “devastation”, and above all, to the plundering and impoverishment of the country resulting from the considerable burdens of debt that arise from war, and he mentions as possible consequences of war, subjugation, the loss of liberty, and foreign domination. In addition, there is the corruption of morals when subjects are instigated by the government to commit such criminal acts as spying and spreading false information or to commit acts of treachery, for example, as snipers or assassins” (pp. 166-7).

But Kant has no inkling, Habermas points out, of world wars; he was thinking of wars between regimes or states, not ethnic or civil wars, guerilla warfare and terror bombing or wars with political intent. In contrast, the wars of Kant’s time were “limited wars.” The positing of a “peace alliance” was supposed to “put an end to war forever and achieve “perpetual peace.” “But the peace in question is as limited as the war from which it arises” (p. 167). Once war becomes unlimited and universal in the gruesome wars of the twentieth-century, however, Habermas states soberly, only then “does the idea arise that war itself—in the form of a war of aggression—is a crime that deserves to be outlawed and punished” (ibid.).

Kant’s primary task is a delicate one

The primary task facing Kant is a most delicate conceptual and political one. Habermas states that Kant “must specify what differentiates cosmopolitan law from classical international law—in other words, what is specific to ius cosmopoliticum” (p. 168). Basically, Kant argues that the movement beyond “weak recognition” occurs once the “envisaged federation of free states which renounce war once and for all in their external relations is supposed to leave intact the sovereignty of its members” (ibid.). Indeed, Kant “compares the federation of nations to a ‘permanent congress of states’” (p. 169). But, Habermas wonders, how can one guarantee permanence, “on which a ‘civilized’ resolution of international conflict depends, without the legally binding character of an institution analogous to a state constitution Kant never explains”? (ibid.).

What is at stake here? Operating like a neuro-surgeon using laser instruments, Habermas observes that because Kant does not think of the federation of states as an “organization with common institutions” that could acquire “coercive authority,” he must rely “exclusively on each government’s own moral self-obligation” (ibid.). However, the decisive question within the social learning framework is “how the permanent self-obligation of states that retain their sovereignty can be ensured” (p. 170). All of our thought and actions are bound to historical time. Our horizons are captive to the “knowledge-forms” that have evolved through the ages to a spot in time. In turn, the structure of consciousness itself is bound with evolved economic and political organization forms.

But these cultural, economic and political structures can enter into crisis, rendering old ways of thought outmoded and even deeply unethical. Habermas states that: “Because Kant does not transcend the horizon of his time, it is of course equally difficult for him to believe in any moral motivation for creating and maintaining a federation between free states dedicated to power politics. Kant sketches as a solution to this problem a philosophy of history with a cosmopolitan purpose which is supposed to lend plausibility, through a ‘hidden purpose of nature,’ and to the improbably ‘agreement between politics and morality’” (p. 171). Red flags are waving in the wind. Is Kant sneaking in a providential, though secularized, God? It seems so. Kant wants to combine a cosmopolitan federation of nation-states with the moral kingdom of God on earth.

Why a federation of nation is in each nation’s enlightened interest

Habermas examines Kant’s “three basic quasi-natural tendencies that complement reason and are supposed to explain why a federation of nations could be in the enlightened self-interest of each state: (1) the peaceful character of republics, (2) the power of international trade to forge an association, (3) the function of the political public sphere” (ibid.). Although these assumptions have been falsified in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Habermas still thinks that Kant’s views “nevertheless also support the claim that a conception of cosmopolitan law appropriately reformulated for contemporary conditions might well meet with a supportive constellation of forces, depending on how we ourselves interpret the changed circumstances of the twentieth century” (pp. 171-2).

Kant’s first argument asserts that “international relations lose their belligerent character to the extent that the republican form of government prevails within states, because it is in the interest of the population of constitutional states to compel their governments to pursue peaceful policies …” (p. 172). Sadly, Habermas observes that the nation-state would not turn out to be more peaceful than its predecessors. Nor could Kant “foresee that the mass mobilization of recruits inflamed by nationalistic passions would usher in an age of devastating, ideologically unlimited wars of liberation” (ibid.).

As many commentators have pointed out, Kant’s second argument saw hopeful promise in the “growing interdependence of societies generated by the exchange of information, persons, and commodities, but especially by the expansion of trade, a tendency favourable to the peaceful unification of peoples” (p. 173). In Kant’s own words: “For spirit of commerce sooner or later takes hold of every people, and it cannot exist side by side with war. And of all the powers (or means) at the disposal of the power of the state, financial power can probably be relied on the most. These states find themselves compelled to promote the noble cause of peace” (cited, p. 173).

This noble cause of peace would be shattered within nation-states as class conflict ripped apart national unity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It also fragmented the world socialist movement in World War I, who were marching under the banner of “internationalism.” The workers of the world didn’t unite (nor did nations); they were swept into frenzied nationalist fervour and killed each other. Habermas rightly concludes: “Throughout the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries, European governments repeatedly exploited the mobilizing power of nationalism to deflect conflicts outward and to neutralize them with foreign policy successes” (pp. 173-4).

Trapped within the horizon of thought in the late 18th century, Kant’s astonishing mind could not have gazed down history’s blood-stained alleyways to see how the global economy (ruled by the US with China close behind) would become so immensely powerful (ruled by mega-corporations) that it determined the policies weak nation-states would adhere to and had the military and financial might to force unjust and unwanted policies on various nation-states.

Kant’s third argument is highly significant for Habermasian thought. “To the extent that the political public sphere has a surveillance function, it can prevent the implementation of ‘shady’ policies that are inconsistent with publicly defensible maxims by exposing them to public criticism” (p. 175). Habermas does, in fact, notice that the educators Kant had in mind were philosophers—the “public teachers of the law,” who could “freely and publicly discuss the maxims of waging war and instituting peace” and can convince the public of citizens of the validity of their basic principles.

“Kant surely had the example of Frederick II and Voltaire in mind when he wrote this moving sentence. “It is not to be expected that kings will philosophize or that philosophers will become kings; nor is it to be desired, however, since the possession of power inevitably corrupts the free judgment of reason. Kings and sovereign peoples (i.e. those who govern themselves by egalitarian laws) should not, however, force the class of philosophers to disappear or to remain silent, but should allow them to speak publicly. This is essential to both in order that light may be thrown on their affairs and … is beyond suspicion” (cited, p. 175). Kant gives “critical intellectuals” a guiding role to inform the public.

These days philosophers are more modest than Kant regarding the primary pedagogical role of the philosopher. Nonetheless, Habermas applauds Kant’s worry about censorship of power. Alas! Habermas states that Kant “could not foresee the structural transformation of the bourgeois public sphere dominated by the electronic mass media and pervaded by images” (p. 176). But Kant was bold and far-sighted enough in thinking to see that a global public sphere was “only beginning to emerge as a result of global communication: ‘The peoples of the earth (!) have thus entered in varying degrees into a universal community; and it has developed to the point where a violation of rights in one of the world is felt everywhere. The idea of a cosmopolitan right is therefore not fantastical or overstrained; it is a necessary right of humanity. Only under this condition [namely, that of a functioning global public sphere—J.H.] can we flatter ourselves that we are continually advancing toward a perpetual peace” (cited, p. 176). Travelling the treacherous road to cosmopolitan world order, one feels like John Bunyan’s pilgrim who faces numerous dangerous places and persons along the road to distract and sideline his destiny.

The presence of a global public sphere is axiomatic

The presence of a global public sphere is axiomatic for the post-national constellation project; it is axiomatic and incredibly difficult to achieve. Habermas considers that the Viet Nam and Gulf wars captured the attention of the world public sphere. Massacres with one’s TV dinner—these ghastly images cracked open our little worlds. Writing in the late 1990s, Habermas senses, as well, that UN-sponsored conferences on ecology, problems of population, poverty and global warming thematized “problems important for human survival for the global public, that is, by an appeal to world opinion” (pp. 176-7). The least we might say is that a new type of organization—the non-governmental organization (NGO)—created and mobilized “transnational public spheres is at least an indication of the growing impact on the press and media of actors who confront states from within the network of civil society” (p. 177).

Writers like David Held (Global covenant: the social democratic alternative to the Washington Consensus [2004]), Richard Falk (On humane government: toward a new global politics [1995] and Habermas himself have placed great emphasis on the way global civil society comes close to being a stand-in for a global parliament. This “strong thesis,” however, has drawn critical commentary. James Schmidt (Radical cosmopolitanism: the ethics and politics of democratic universalism [2013[), for instance, raises three salient questions regarding global civil society’s anti-democratic tendencies. First, the nation-state does lose some of its decision-making authority when institutions like the WTO, NAFTA or IMF make their own autonomous decisions: this “entails a massive loss of democratic self-determination” (p. 138). Second, many lauded NGOs “make moral appeals to those in power with some power on behalf of those with no power. As the paradigm examples (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Medecins sans frontieres) illustrate, for all the good they do, the groups of civil society are generally composed of well-situated people from the metropole who seek to represent the interests of a large number of voiceless people on the periphery to even better-situated people in the metropole” (p. 139).

These civil society associations engage more in a kind of consultative process with decision-makers than a dialogical one that permits ordinary folks to enter the conversation circles. They also adopt more of an advisory role rather than that of a grassroots struggle for power: they aim to persuade those in power to be more enlightened and create a more humane world. Third, and perhaps most telling, global civil society advocates tend to offer ideal blueprints without any discussion of the “mechanisms for realizing that future or recommends measures—morally inspired reforms by the powerful—that contradict the very principle of equality on which its aspirations are based” (p. 142).

Reformulating Kant’s idea of a cosmopolitan order

Given the critical comments on Perpetual peace, Habermas avers that “Kant’s idea of a cosmopolitan order must be reformulated if it is not to lose touch with a global system that has changed fundamentally” (p. 178). Here, “sparks of hope” can be fanned to keep us struggling towards building the cosmopolitan world order. Wilson’s League of Nations and the United Nations give tangible form to cosmopolitan ideals. If Kant’s proposal is to be revised for our time, Habermas surmises, we must focus on three aspects: (1) “the external sovereignty of states and the altered character of relations among them; (2) the internal sovereignty of states and the normative limitations of classical power politics; (3) the stratification of world society and the globalization of dangers that necessitate a reconceptualization of what is meant by ‘peace.’” Kant’s concept of a permanent federation of states is, as we have seen, inconsistent” (p. 179). By this Habermas means “cosmopolitan law must be institutionalized in such a way that it is binding on the individual governments” (ibid.).

Unless sanctions can be applied justly and legally to the community of peoples, the cosmopolitan order will unravel even further than it has today. A viable federation needs “common institutions which assume state functions, that is which legally regulate the relations between its members and monitor their compliance with these rules” (ibid.). For instance, the UN Charter, with prohibition Article 2.4, forbids offensive wars. Although the Charter is responding to a “transnational situation,” the UN lacks its “own military forces; it does not even have forces it could deploy under its own command, let alone have a monopoly over the means of violence” (p. 180).

This is a much-repeated lament. And the UN Security Council, while it is supposed to counter-balance the UN’s lack of power to impose sanctions, had led to decades of stalemate between superpowers, given the biased, self-interested use of the veto. Christina Lafont (“Alternative visions of a new global order: what should cosmopolitan law hope for?” [2008]), an eminent and prolific historian of deliberative democracy, affirms that there is widespread agreement within the global community that “international justice requires guaranteeing peace, security, and the protection of human rights” (p. 44).

Diogenes and Cicero may have used the phrase “citizen of the world” long ago, but Habermas suggests that Kant “conceived of the cosmopolitan community as a federation of states, not of world citizens” (p. 180). This seems like a strange inconsistency. The reason has primarily to do with Kant’s anchoring of law in general on individual rights-bearers. For Habermas, in contrast, the “point of cosmopolitan law is, rather, that it bypasses the collective subjects of international law and directly establishes the legal status of the individual subjects by granting them unmediated membership in the association of free and equal citizens” (p. 181). We become, as it were, dual citizens. Now we have moved on to very controversial ground. “The most important implication of a form of law that bypasses the sovereignty of states is the personal liability of individuals for crimes committed in the course of government and military service” (ibid.).

As but one vivid illustration of how current times have bypassed Kant, Habermas mentions how the UN has its “own mechanisms for establishing that human rights violations have occurred” (ibid.). Still, the “weak link in the global protection of human rights remains the absence of an executive power that could enforce the General Declaration of Human Rights” (p. 182). Further, we await universal commitment to the International Court of Justice. Lafont (2008) argues incisively that to “achieve” the goals of Habermas’ model, he will need to lay the “minimal social and economic conditions necessary to achieve the human rights goals of the UN Charter” (p. 46). The mobilization of moral capital to transform the global order confronts an anarchic Neo-liberal disordering of the world and a profoundly fractured global community. I dream—with Kant—that the philosophy of history and human nature carry the seeds of a movement beyond the warring nation-states. Let’s hope and watch for the blooming.",Q2

Authorities believe the baby, Nova Grace Whatley-Trejo, was in the car for hours on Tuesday. The girl’s grandmother found the baby in the car and took her to the hospital sometime before 10 p.m., Snellville Police Detective Jeff Manley said at a news conference Wednesday.

Manley said the girl’s father, Davied Whatley, 20, arrived at the Snellville Police Department around 2 p.m. Tuesday to retrieve a firearm that was seized in an unrelated incident.

He said unbeknownst to police, Whatley had left his daughter in a car parked two buildings away at the City Hall.

Firearms are not returned until police conduct a background check to make sure the person is not a convicted felon, Manley said at the news conference. During the check, officers learned Whatley had a warrant for probation violation and arrested him at the station.

Manley said Whatley was on video from the time he arrived at the police station to the moment he was transported and released to deputies at the Gwinnett County Detention Center. Whatley made no reference to Snellville police that his daughter was in the car, Manley said.

“He made no statements as to the fact that his daughter was left in the car two buildings away from the Snellville Police Department,” he told reporters.

Manley said the baby was found after the grandmother “was alerted” by Whatley. He said the baby was dead by the time the grandmother found her.

He did not provide details about how or when Whatley was able to contact the grandmother. According to the National Weather Service, temperatures reached a high of 86 degrees Tuesday afternoon in Atlanta, located about 30 miles northeast of Snellville.

“I’m absolutely astounded that somebody would leave an 8-month-old in a car and park away from our building and walk up here knowing that child was in the car and leave them there. It’s astounding,” Manley said.

Whatley bonded out of jail Tuesday night on the warrant charge but was re-arrested Wednesday on a charge of second-degree murder, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. It’s not clear if he has obtained an attorney.

KOB 4 took a closer look at the resources we have in New Mexico and the ones coming from afar.

At this time, the agency coordinating resources for the southwest portion of the country says 20 crew members have arrived in New Mexico, some from Arizona, with 39 engines, five helicopters and two planes currently in action.

“They are sent wherever they are needed,” said Punky Moore with the Southwest Coordination Center.

Some of them responding to multiple fires in New Mexico, going from one location to the other. And more help is on the way.

""We have received and are ordering crews from other geographic areas,"" said Moore.

That includes FEMA stepping in as well. The state was granted five federal teams, their job is to help coordinate firefighting efforts on all the wildfires here.

""That’s pretty unheard of to have that many going on at one time,"" said Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Kelly Hamilton.

Hamilton is currently in Ruidoso for the McBride fire. The problem is, air crews are still running into those strong wind gusts – preventing aircraft ready to go from taking flight.

""I assure you none of them want to be on the ground and the crews don’t want to be on the ground, but the wind is such to where they can’t be,"" said Hamilton.

However, we’ve seen a few go up. But Hamilton says many are on standby, waiting for the opportunity to battle these destructive fires from the air.

KOB 4 also learned the ten tanker, which is stationed at the Albuquerque Sunport, is also battling these wildfires and is headed to the McBride fire in Ruidoso.",Q2

For anyone who has spent any amount of time in the Lone Star State, you know there is no shortage of amazing food. When people think about food that originated here, the first thing that comes to mind is Blue Bell, chicken fried steak and Tex-Mex.According to Wikipedia, corn dogs were first introduced to Texas by Germans settlers in the 1920s, although at the time they were made without a stick. And while other purveyors have tried to claim stake to inventing this favorite street food on a stick, brothers Carl and Neil Fletcher introduced the world to their “corny dogs” at the State Fair of Texas in 1942, although discovery and development began as early as 1938.As we celebrate National Corn Dog Day this Saturday, we've rounded up a list of great places around North Texas to get either the original, a slight variation of the original or some completely off-the-wall rendition you should check out.Prior to the pandemic, you could only get the coveted Fletcher’s Corny Dogs at Texas State Fair. And get them we all did (and still do). They sell about 500,000 corny dogs during the three weeks of the Texas State Fair. But in 2020, when the Texas State Fair was halted due to COVID, the Fletcher family had to pivot and implement plan B. They started offering them at Golden Chick as a limited-time offer, but also bought a few food trailers and now host pop-up events and provide catering services throughout the city.In addition to the original corny dog, there are other variations available, such as the jalapeño and cheese, the bird dog, the veggie dog, the cheezy pup and the “make mine Texan dog.” They also offer old-fashioned funnel cakes, curly fries, lemonade and deep-fried Oreos. Some corn dog options can also be shipped throughout the U.S. via Goldbelly.They'll have a mobile kitchen parked near the Katy Trail (3311 Knox St.) from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, March 19, selling corny dogs, lemonade and funnel cakes.The corn dogs at Lakewood Landing endure .

Named Best Corn Dog in 2021 by the, mother and daughter duo, Vic and Jace Fletcher (yes, you read that last name correctly) are purveyors of fine stick food at their two restaurants. Of course, they have their signature corn dogs, which include the classic, the spice dog (jalapeño cheddar) and the brunch dog (breakfast sausage dipped in funnel cake batter with bacon and maple syrup). And if you aspire to be “healthy yet indulgent,” they also have turkey or plant-based corn dogs.What really intrigues us about a CornDog with No Name are their “exotic dogs.""

They also add different toppings to the batter (cubed potatoes and hot Cheetos, for example). And you can get a mozzarella cheese stick instead of a hotdog at the center, or half of each. Pair it with one of the sweet or savory seasonings and dipping sauces and you will have the perfect snack on a stick.Recently re-opened since suffering fire damage a few months ago, Heim Barbecue is back and ready to serve you some killer corn dogs, and not just on Tuesdays.

https://localnews8.com/politics/cnn-us-politics/2022/05/24/who-is-brad-raffensperger-georgias-republican-secretary-of-state-2/,"Who is Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state?","By Shawna Mizelle, CNN

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is being swept into another sensitive political matter, the latest in a series of headline-grabbing incidents for an official whose day-to-day duties typically render the position obscure.

The Republican who serves as Georgia’s top elections official on Friday accepted a state judge’s recommendation that Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene shouldn’t be disqualified over her role in the January 6 insurrection. Raffensperger formally ruled that Greene will stay on the ballot, though anti-Greene challengers have vowed to appeal.

Raffensperger, 66, is probably best known for refusing then-President Donald Trump’s push in a bombshell phone call to “find” votes in Trump’s favor needed to overturn the 2020 presidential results in Georgia. During the January 2, 2021, call, Trump lambasted his fellow Republican for refusing to falsely say that he had won the election in Georgia and repeatedly touted baseless claims of election fraud.

“The people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated,” Trump said in one part of the call. Raffensperger responded, “Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.”

Raffensperger has continued to defend his performance and remains committed to the idea that the election was conducted fairly and offered a warning to those who charged otherwise without evidence.

It was among the strongest public stands for election integrity taken by a Republican under immense pressure from Trump and his followers — and it wasn’t without consequences.

“You and your family will be killed very slowly,” read one anonymous text that Raffensperger’s wife, Tricia, told Reuters in an exclusive interview last year that she had received, an example of the kinds of threats and scrutiny his family faced. Brad Raffensperger told CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” at the time that the threats were unacceptable.

“This is not acceptable behavior to threaten the wives, the children, the family of people that work for the government or even the government workers,” he said. “They didn’t sign up for this.”

Raffensperger became a pariah of sorts within the GOP, facing calls for resignation from within his own party and censure at the Georgia GOP convention in 2021 due to “dereliction of his constitutional duty.”

“Let me start by saying that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” he said at the time in response to the calls for him to step down.

“As secretary of state, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts and that illegal votes don’t count,” Raffensperger continued.

A business background

Raffensperger, who touts himself as a conservative Republican, took office in 2019. He had served two terms in the Georgia General Assembly in 2015-2019.

Raffensperger obtained his bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from Western University and has a Master of Business Administration degree from Georgia State University, according to the Georgia secretary of state website.

A campaign website describes him as a structural engineer and founder of a steel company known as Tendon Systems. “As the CEO of a thriving company, Brad uses business principles to run the office of Georgia Secretary of State, including purchasing and deploying modern voting machines across the entire state that could be audited and verified, including a full recount by hand, if necessary,” the website says.

Brad and Tricia Raffensperger have been married for more than 45 years, according to his campaign website. The couple has three sons.

Running for reelection

Raffensperger’s term is set to end next year, and the secretary of state is running for reelection while facing three opponents in the primary field ahead of the election later this month. His leading opponent, Republican Rep. Jody Hice, has aligned himself with Trump’s political brand and previously said Trump would’ve won the 2020 election in Georgia if it had been “fair” — a stance that garnered an endorsement from the former President.

In a primary field in which his Republican opponents have committed themselves to fighting voter fraud — despite the fact that such fraud barely exists and President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the Peach State was affirmed by three ballot counts — Raffensperger has expressed commitment to the same issue.

On Monday, after Hice falsely accused Raffensperger of creating “ballot harvesting” — generally speaking, the phrase refers to the practice of organizations or activists collecting voters’ completed absentee ballots and submitting them for counting rather than voters sending in their ballots themselves or getting family members or friends to submit them — Raffensperger said Hice “has just not been honest for the last 18 months, and he has been spreading misinformation, disinformation.”

To further emphasize the point, Raffensperger’s campaign website touts him as the “first to ban ballot harvesting” in Georgia.

Raffensperger has also supported a controversial law passed in the wake of Biden’s victory to impose new voting restrictions.

In an interview last year on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” Raffensperger said that although elections were run “fairly, honestly and accurately,” the law, which limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water, was about addressing voter confidence in the election systems.

“At the end of the day, it has never been easier to vote in the state of Georgia, and we still have accessibility. We also have balanced that out with security,” he said.

The News & Observer reports that Michael Todd Hill, 54, of Leland, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced Friday in the killing of 23-year-old Keonna Graham of Navassa. Graham was reported missing on July 20, 2020. She was later found dead in a hotel with a gunshot wound to the back of the head.

In a news release from the 15th Prosecutorial District of North Carolina, prosecutors said surveillance footage from the hotel showed Hill was the only person in the room with Graham.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1692505/senate-body-condemns-use-of-force-against-pti-marchers,Senate body condemns use of force against PTI marchers,"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Tuesday condemned what is said excessive use of force by law enforcement agencies prior to and during the ‘Haqiqi Azadi March’ of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).

The Senate Standing Committee on Interior met to discuss and fix responsibility on the use of what it said use of undue force on the participants of the march, obstructions created in their ways and the registration of first information reports (FIRs) against them.

“It is necessary to investigate where the abuse took place during the Haqiqi Azadi March,” chairman of the committee, Senator Mohsin Aziz demanded.

The members were shown videos of violence against participants of the march, including members of parliament.

Forms subcommittee, comprising all political parties, to probe and file report for fixing responsibility

Senators Ijaz Chaudhry, Azam Khan Swati, Shibli Faraz, Faisal Javed among members of the Punjab and Sindh assemblies and former Punjab health minister Dr Yasmeen Rashid alleged atrocities committed against them.

Shehzad Waseem, leader of the opposition in the Senate, demanded details of tear gas fired on the protesters while Senator Zeeshan Khanzada asked for details on raids carried out on May 23-25. Senator Fauzia Arshad said peaceful protesters were tortured. Senator Saifullah Abro demanded that police officers who violated the law should be brought to book.

“Torturing protesters and restraining them by force is contempt of court. Withdraw FIRs against the citizens,” Senator Faisal Saleem added.

Minister for Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazir Tarar said the issue of senators Ijaz Chaudhry and Azam Khan Swati had been raised with the Ministry of Home Affairs. He occasionally interrupted the proceedings by insisting that the matter was sub judice and according to rules it should not be debated. He hoped that a decision would be made by the court in this regard soon.

Senator Maula Bakhsh Chandio challenged the impartiality of the committee and also interrupted the proceedings with frequent sarcastic remarks.

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad Dr Akbar Nasir Khan, responding to questions from the senators, said tear gas used on the protesters caused irritation in the eyes only. “Expired tear gas shells were not used. No other chemicals were used to disperse the crowds on May 25,” he said.

Tear gas was fired at the protesters after the court denied them entry to D-Chowk. He said: “No one is detained in Islamabad at the moment. Everyone was released following the court order.”

After a lengthy discussion, the chairman of the committee decided to form a subcommittee, comprising all political parties, to probe into the use of force against the participants so that responsibility could be fixed.

“It is important to note that the administration should not be given so much power,” he said.

Written questions regarding use of police force and violations of human rights would be forwarded to the concerned authorities, the committee chairman.

He said it was inappropriate to register challans in anti-terrorism courts against youth protesting peacefully in Umerkot.

The chairman of the committee decided that the next meeting on the issue would be held in camera.

In response, Starbucks said the closure wasn’t related to the store recently being unionized, but resulted from facilities, staffing, and ""time and attendance"" issues at the store.

""With deep care and urgency we continuously work to create the kind of store environment that partners and customers expect of Starbucks. Our goal is to ensure that every partner is supported in their individual situation, and we have immediate opportunities available in the market.""

Employees at the Ithaca location, located near the Cornell University campus, voted to unionize in April.

The workers at that location mounted a one-day strike after saying there was an unsafe situation at the store, saying an overflowing grease trap had spilled wastewater and oil onto the floor.

""We open and close stores as a regular part of our operations,"" Starbucks spokesperson Reggie Borges said Friday, according to the report.

The union is asking the agency to get an injunction to more quickly prevent or reverse the closure.

Anthony Rauda, 45, arrived in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of battery on a peace officer stemming from two separate attacks on Los Angeles Count sheriff's deputies in March 2020 and last month.

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Rauda had his arms and legs tied to a special chair to prevent him from potentially harming anyone. Unlike during previous hearings, Rauda did not have a spit hood on and instead wore a facemask.

Rauda is scheduled to go on trial in September on a murder charge for allegedly shooting and killing Tristan Thomas Beaudette, 35, on June 22, 2018, in Malibu Creek State Park. The father was gunned down inside a tent he shared with his daughters, ages two and four at the time, who were unharmed.

Rauda also faces 10 counts of attempted murder and five counts of second-degree commercial burglary.

Rauda had his arms and legs tied to a special chair to prevent him from potentially harming anyone

Last month, a judge found sufficient evidence to have Rauda tried for the battery charges

On Thursday, Judge David Fields ordered Rauda back in court on May 3 for a pre-trial hearing.

Rauda (left) is set to go to trial in September for the June 2018 murder of research scientist Tristan Thomas Beaudette (right)

Despite having been in jail for nearly four years, Rauda, a career criminal, has managed to rack up additional charges while in custody and earn himself a reputation as a violent inmate, leading to the use of a restraint chair, and occasionally a spit hood, during his court appearances.

On March 30, 2020, Rauda allegedly punched a sheriff's deputy in the jaw and injured his wrist following a court hearing, reported MyNewsLA.

Two years later, on March 16, Rauda was being removed from a restraint chair following a hearing, from which he had been ejected for yelling obscenities, when he allegedly attacked another deputy with a pencil.

During that hearing last month, Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo told Rauda that he was being restrained due to his 'unpredictably violent behavior.'

At a subsequent probable cause hearing on March 24, another judge found 'more than sufficient evidence' to order Rauda to stand trial for the alleged attacks on the deputies, and refused to downgrade the felony battery charges against him to misdemeanors.

On Thursday, Judge David Fields ordered Rauda back in court on May 3 for a pre-trial hearing.

According to reports, Rauda allegedly shot Beaudette in the early morning of June 22, 2018 while sharing a tent with daughters.

Beaudette, 35, was camping with his daughters, ages 2 and 4 at the time (pictured together with the victim's wife), in Malibu Creek State Park when Rauda allegedly shot him inside the family's tent

Rauda was later arrested after deputies found him with a rifle in the Malibu Canyon area

The family were camping in Malibu Creek State Park for what was supposed to be a final trip before the Beaudettes moved from Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area.

Beaudette, who was a pharmaceutical scientist, took the children while his wife, Erica Wu, studied for an exam at home.

The father was shot in his upper chest, but his two daughters were spared.

At the time, Rauda had a string of weapon-related convictions dating back to 2006, according to a criminal complaint.

Authorities said that Rauda carried out attacks starting November 2016, when he allegedly wounded a man who was sleeping in a hammock near the Malibu State Park area.

He is accused of firing a shot at a vehicle less than a week later and shooting into vehicles on three separate occasions in 2017.

Rauda is also being held for a series of burglaries in the Agoura Hills/ Calabasas area where someone smashed a vending machine and stole food from the Calabasas Community Center.

Similar incidents were reported at several offices and buildings in the Malibu Canyon area.

In all the recorded heists, the suspect only stole food.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said that Rauda is a 'survivalist' who often slept outside in the Malibu area and the stolen food may have been to feed himself.

Rauda, pictured in a restraint chair and a spit hood, was formally charged with murder and attempted murder in January 2019 (pictured)

During a hearing in March, Rauda was ejected from the courtroom after yelling obscenities'

Rauda was arrested after deputies found him in a ravine in the Malibu Canyon area while officers were searching the area after Baudette's murder.

They followed a series of fresh footprints until they found Rauda dressed in all black and carrying a rifle.

They booked him for parole violations at the time and investigated whether he was involved in eight thefts that spanned two years.

Rauda was formally charged with shooting and killing Baudette in January 2019.

According to Dallas Police Department Spokeswoman Kristin Lowman, Lowe was free on a $250,000 bond for murder out of Denton County.

“You could probably just play back tape of me saying this over and over again, that that is not what the goal of bond or bail reform was to have an individual suspected of murder out on bond.

""We are doing everything we can to maintain safety. It's just you have instances like this where people have no regard for other people's safety and they start shooting weapons and they don't care who's in the way,"" said Albert Martinez, executive assistant police chief with the Dallas Police Department.

Chief Garcia, speaking at a department graduation Friday morning, credited officers stationed in Deep Ellum for their quick response and for providing first aid to the shooting victims while commenting on the boldness of those willing to open fire in public.

""The brazenness of these criminals is what astonishes me the most,"" Garcia said.

According to police, anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact the Dallas Police Department's Homicide Unit.

POLICE MAKE CHANGES TO CURB WEEKEND VIOLENCE IN DEEP ELLUM

At the end of last year, Dallas Police Chief Eddie García vowed to “take Deep Ellum back” for patrons and residents. His announcement came after a shooting in Deep Ellum that killed a teenager and left five others injured, including a 15-year-old girl.

Dallas Police started closing streets to vehicle traffic in Deep Ellum on Friday and Saturday nights in April.

The closures, police said, were implemented in the interest of public safety each summer as pedestrian traffic in the popular entertainment district increases.

Parts of Main, Elm, and Pryor streets will close completely starting at 10 p.m. Southbound Malcolm X Boulevard will be closed from Indiana to Commerce Street. Indiana and Crowdus streets will also have limited closures.

Police said the roads will reopen by 3 a.m. after traffic has cleared.

Following the shooting early Friday morning, Dallas police said they will continue to have a stepped-up presence in Deep Ellum.

Starting this weekend, for the summer, @dallaspd will close streets to vehicle traffic in Deep Ellum starting at 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays.

LOVING COUNTY, Texas — The Texas Department of Public Safety has identified the six people who were killed, and four more who were injured, in a car wreck in Loving County Monday.

According to DPS, Juvenal Segura was driving a Toyota Tundra north on County Road 300. He was accompanied by five passengers, Leoncio Tavera-Trejo, Marco Antonio Tavera-Trejo, Ernestro Lugo, Oscar Rico and Efrian Cruz-Camacho.

Christopher Villarreal was driving a Ford F-250 pickup west on Ranch to Market Road 652. He was accompanied by three passengers, Gustavo Villarreal, Alejandro Diaz and Cruz Hernandez Rubiel.

Segura disregarded the stop sign at the intersection of County Road 300 and Ranch to Market Road 652 and hit the left passenger side of the F-250.

The impact caused the Tundra to slide through the intersection and crash its right passenger side into a utility pole.

From the Tundra, Leoncio Tavera-Trejo, Marco Antonio Tavera-Trejo, Lugo and Cruz-Camacho were all pronounced dead at the scene. Segura was taken to the hospital in stable condition. Rico was taken to the hospital in critical condition.

The report did not specify which passenger was sitting where, but it did say three rear-seat passengers were all ejected from the truck.

Courageous mom Angeli Rose Gomez managed to enter Robb Elementary School during a gunman’s rampage last month after she was arrested by officers on the scene while she begged police to rush the school.

Angeli Gomez is still being harassed by Uvalde cops, to the point where she's sent her 2 boys to stay elsewhere so they ""don't feel like they have to watch cops passing by, stopping, parking"" at home.

In a recent interview with Fox 29 San Antonio, Gomez claimed she’s now being harassed by Uvalde police at her home for humiliating the department by seemingly doing their job for them.

Ever since that harrowing day, Gomez says she has faced scrutiny from law enforcement, even at her own home, “the other night we were exercising and we had a cop parked at the corner like, flickering us with his headlights.” Because of these incidents, Gomez said she has had to separate from her boys, “just so my sons don’t feel like they have to watch cops passing by, stopping, parking.”

The mom called out Uvalde police following their inaction that day, criticizing them for failing to mobilize in a timely manner against the killer who was inside murdering innocent children.

“The police were doing nothing,” she told the Wall Street Journal in the days following the incident. “They were just standing outside the fence. They weren’t going in there or running anywhere.”

In an interview with CBS earlier this month, Gomez claimed police threatened to charge her with obstruction of justice if she continued to speak out.

“According to Gomez, the police subsequently contacted her and said that the media attention she was generating for criticizing them could lead to obstruction of justice charges. (Gomez is on probation for unspecified though decades-old charges,)” reports Reason.com.

Fox 29 reports despite the harassment, Gomez continues to protest against the pitiful police response that day and advocate for the removal of Uvalde CISD Police Chief Pete Arredondo.

She’s also planning to file a lawsuit against police seeking restitution for the department’s wrongdoing.

Texas DPS Director Steve McCraw earlier this month also criticized Chief Arredondo and the Uvalde police response, calling it an “abject failure.”

Safety & Shipping Review 2022: 54 large ships lost worldwide last year. Total losses down 57% over past decade. South China , Indochina, Indonesia , and the Philippines top loss location. British Isles see most shipping incidents.

Ukraine invasion has multiple impacts: loss of life/vessels, exacerbation of crew crisis, trade disruption, sanctions burden, cost and availability of bunker fuel.

Fires, container ship and car carrier incidents leading to oversized losses and ‘general average’ process becoming more frequent. Sustainability concerns driving up costs of salvage and wreck removal. Decarbonization of shipping industry creating new risks.

Shipping boom safety impact: growing use of non-container vessels to carry containers, working life of vessels being extended, port congestion putting crews and facilities under pressure.

NEW YORK --(BUSINESS WIRE)--

The international shipping industry is responsible for the carriage of about 90% of world trade, so vessel safety is critical. The sector continued its long-term positive safety trend over the past year, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , the growing number of costly issues involving larger vessels, crew and port congestion challenges resulting from the shipping boom, as well as managing challenging decarbonization targets, means there is no room for complacency, according to marine insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE’s (AGCS) Safety & Shipping Review 2022.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220510005157/en/

AGCS Safety and Shipping Review 2022 in Numbers (Graphic: Business Wire)

“The shipping sector has demonstrated tremendous resilience through stormy seas in recent years, as evidenced by the boom we see in several parts of the industry today,” says Captain Rahul Khanna , Global Head of Marine Risk Consulting at AGCS. “Total losses are at record lows – around 50 to 75 a year over the last four years compared with 200+ annually in the 1990s. However, the tragic situation in Ukraine has caused widespread disruption in the Black Sea and elsewhere, exacerbating ongoing supply chain, port congestion, and crew crisis issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, some of the industry’s responses to the shipping boom, such as changing the use of, or extending the working life of, vessels also raise warning flags. Meanwhile, the increasing number of problems posed by large vessels, such as fires, groundings and complex salvage operations, continue to challenge ship owners and their crews.”

The annual AGCS study analyzes reported shipping losses and casualties (incidents) over 100 gross tons. During 2021, 54 total losses of vessels were reported globally, compared with 65 a year earlier. This represents a 57% decline over 10 years (127 in 2012), while during the early 1990s the global fleet was losing 200+ vessels a year. The 2021 loss total is made more impressive by the fact that there are an estimated 130,000 ships in the global fleet today, compared with some 80,000 30 years ago. Such progress reflects the increased focus on safety measures over time through training and safety programs, improved ship design, technology and regulation.

According to the report, there have been almost 900 total losses over the past decade (892). The South China , Indochina, Indonesia , and the Philippines maritime region is the main global loss hotspot, accounting for one-in-five losses in 2021 (12) and one-in-four-losses over the past decade (225), driven by factors, including high levels of trade, congested ports, older fleets, and extreme weather. Globally, cargo ships (27) account for half of vessels lost in the past year and 40% over the past decade. Foundered (sunk/submerged) was the main cause of total losses over the past year, accounting for 60% (32).

While total losses declined over the past year, the number of reported shipping casualties or incidents rose. The British Isles saw the highest number (668 out of 3,000). Machinery damage accounted for over one-in-three incidents globally (1,311), followed by collision (222) and fires (178), with the number of fires increasing by almost 10%.

Ukraine impact: safety and insurance



The shipping industry has been affected on multiple fronts by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , with the loss of life and vessels in the Black Sea , disruption to trade, and the growing burden of sanctions. It also faces challenges to day-to-day operations, with knock-on effects for crew, the cost and availability of bunker fuel, and the potential for growing cyber risk.

The invasion has further ramifications for a global maritime industry already facing shortages. Russian seafarers account for just over 10% of the world’s 1.89 million workforce, while around 4% come from Ukraine . These seafarers may struggle to return home or rejoin ships at the end of contracts. Meanwhile, a prolonged conflict is likely to have deeper consequences, potentially reshaping global trade in energy and other commodities. An expanded ban on Russian oil could contribute to pushing up the cost of bunker fuel and impacting availability, potentially pushing ship owners to use alternative fuels. If such fuels are of substandard quality, this may result in machinery breakdown claims in future. At the same time, security agencies continue to warn of a heightened prospect of cyber risks for the shipping sector such as GPS jamming, Automatic Identification System (AIS) spoofing and electronic interference.

The evolving range of sanctions against Russian interests presents a sizeable challenge. Violating sanctions can result in severe enforcement action, yet compliance can be a considerable burden. It can be difficult to establish the ultimate owner of a vessel, cargo or counterparty. Sanctions also apply to various parts of the transport supply chain, including banking and insurance, as well as maritime support services, which makes compliance even more complex.

A burning issue: fires on board



During the past year, fires on board the roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) car carrier Felicity Ace and the container ship X-Press Pearl both resulted in total losses. Cargo fires are indeed a priority concern. There have been over 70 reported fires on container ships alone in the past five years, the report notes. Fires often start in containers, which can be the result of non-/mis-declaration of hazardous cargo, such as chemicals and batteries – around 5% of containers shipped may consist of undeclared dangerous goods. Fires on large vessels can spread quickly and be difficult to control, often resulting in the crew abandoning ship, which can significantly increase the final cost of an incident.

Fires have also become a major loss driver for car carriers. Among other causes, they can start in cargo holds, caused by malfunctions or electrical short circuits in vehicles, while the open decks can allow them to spread quickly. The growing numbers of electric vehicles (EVs) transported by sea brings further challenges, given existing counter-measure systems may not respond effectively in the event of an EV blaze. Losses can be expensive, given the value of the car cargo and the cost of wreck removal and pollution mitigation.

When large vessels get into trouble, emergency response and finding a port of refuge can be challenging as well. Specialist salvage equipment, tugs, cranes, barges and port infrastructure are required, which add time and cost to a response. The X-Press Pearl, which sank after it was refused refuge by two ports following a fire, is one of several incidents where container ships have had difficulty finding a safe haven. Meanwhile, the salvage operation for the car carrier Golden Ray , which capsized in the US in 2019, took almost two years and cost in excess of $800mn .

“Too often, what should be a manageable incident on a large vessel can end in a total loss. Salvage is a growing concern. Environmental concerns are contributing to rising salvage and wreck removal costs as ship owners and insurers are expected to go the extra mile to protect the environment and local economies,” says Khanna. “Previously, a wreck might have been left in-situ if it posed no danger to navigation. Now, authorities want wrecks removed and the marine environment restored, irrespective of cost.”

Post-pandemic world brings new risk challenges



While the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in few direct claims for the marine insurance sector, the subsequent impact on crew welfare and the boom in shipping and port congestion raise potential safety concerns. Demand for crew is high, yet many skilled and experienced seafarers are leaving the industry. A serious shortfall of officers is predicted within five years. For those who remain, morale is low as commercial pressures, compliance duties and workloads are running high. Such a work situation is prone to mistakes – 75% of shipping incidents involve human error, AGCS analysis shows.

The economic rebound from Covid-19 lockdowns has created a boom time for shipping, with record increases in charter and freight rates. While this is a positive for shipping companies, higher freight rates and a shortage of container ship capacity are tempting some operators to use bulk carriers, or consider converting tankers, to transport containers. The use of non-container vessels to carry containers raises questions around stability, firefighting capabilities, and securing cargo. Bulk carriers are not designed to carry containers, which could impact their maneuvering characteristics in bad weather, and crew may not be able to respond appropriately in an incident.

Shipping bottlenecks and port congestion



Covid-19 measures in China , a surge in consumer demand, and the Ukraine invasion have all been factors in ongoing unprecedented port congestion, which puts crews, port handlers and facilities under additional pressure. “Loading and unloading vessels is a particularly risky operation, where small mistakes can have big consequences. Busy container ports have little space, while the experienced labor required to handle the containers properly is in short supply. Add in fast turnaround times and this may result in a heightened risk environment,” explains Khanna.

Climate change: transition problems



With momentum gathering behind international efforts to tackle climate change, the shipping industry is coming under increasing pressure to accelerate its sustainability efforts, the report notes, given its greenhouse gas emissions grew by around 10% between 2012 and 2018.

Decarbonization will require big investments in green technology and alternative fuels. A growing number of vessels are already switching to liquefied natural gas (LNG), while other alternative fuels are under development, including ammonia, hydrogen and methanol, as well as electric-powered ships. The transition to alternative fuels will likely bring heightened risk of machinery breakdown claims, among other risks, as new technology beds down and as crews adapt to new procedures.

KENNEDALE, Texas — Editor's note: The details in this story and videos obtained by WFAA are graphic. Viewer discretion is advised. We'll attach the video to this story after it airs.

A Kennedale man has sued two North Texas police officers claiming excessive force in a 2020 incident where he alleges he was struck 16 times in the face with a flashlight.

Clinton Grimsley is suing Kennedale Officer Christopher Kjelsen and Mansfield Officer Brian Raines for excessive use of deadly force. According to the lawsuit, Kennedale officers Brian Andrews and Charles Burns were dispatched to Grimsley’s Kennedale home on April 11, 2020 for a call that Grimsley was starting fires in his front yard and beating on his porch with an object.

Burns and Andrews saw Grimsley as he walked from the side of his home, and they ordered him to drop a toy sword he was carrying and put his hands up, the lawsuit said. Grimsley complied, then was ordered to sit down on the front porch. Officer Burns asked Grimsley if he needed a doctor and Grimsley answered, ""That’s why I was praying.”

Officer Burns ordered Grimsley to stand up so he could check for weapons and a pocketknife was removed from Grimsley's possession. Officers then began to handcuff Grimsley, but he ran away because he feared the officers were going to hurt him, the lawsuit says. Grimsley had one arm handcuffed while he was running away, the lawsuit said.

Officer Kjelsen, one of the officers being sued, then drove up to the scene, pointed his gun at Grimsley and instructed him to get on the ground, according to the lawsuit. Kjelsen's bodycam shows him driving up to the scene, exiting his vehicle and drawing his weapon while yelling at Grimsley.

""Get your a** down right now,"" Kjelsen says in his body cam video. ""Get down! Get down! Get on your face. Don't f****** move.""

Grimsley can be heard in the video groaning while an officer is heard saying ""tase him, get him Burns.""

The lawsuit says Kjelsen ran up to Grimsley, kicked him in the head, then got on top of Grimsley and pistol-whipped him in the back of the head, striking him several times.

Raines, the Mansfield officer being sued by Grimsley, arrived on the scene several minutes later and began hitting Grimsley in the face with a flashlight, according to the suit.

Raines' body camera video showed him running over to the scene where officers had Grimsley pinned to the ground and were locating Grimsley's left hand. In the video, you can hear an officer telling Grimsley ""stop dude, stop"" before Raines started striking Grimsley with the flashlight. According to the lawsuit, Raines hit Grimsley with his flashlight 16 times.

In court documents responding to the lawsuit, Kjelsen admitted that Grimsley was hit in the head during a struggle, but said that Grimsley refused to comply, fought officers and tried to get control of Kjelsen’s Taser and handgun.

“This case is a clear example of when an officer exceeds the level of force required in a given situation by using excessive deadly force in violation of the Constitution,” said James Roberts of Addison, one of Grimsley’s attorneys, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in an email. “Mr. Grimsley was unarmed and restrained by multiple officers on the ground when Officer Brian Raines of the Mansfield Police Department struck him sixteen times in the face with a metal flashlight, causing predictable and significant injuries.”

Raines also filed a response to the lawsuit in federal court, where he denied violating Grimsley’s rights and denied that any force used was unjustified.

Raines' bodycam video shows officers loading Grimsley into a patrol vehicle while requesting more ambulances on scene to assist. After Grimsley was put into the patrol vehicle, an officer asked Raines if he needed anything and he responded, ""Nah, I was hitting him pretty good, and got a (expletive) ton of blood in my mouth.”

Raines added, “I punched him and struck him with the flashlight to the face,” the lawsuit says. “That’s where the injuries are going to be from.”

The Star-Telegram reported that as of last week, Kjelsen was still an officer with Kennedale police, and Raines is a sergeant with Mansfield police.

Grimsley was charged with assault on a peace officer, evading arrest and resisting arrest in this April 2020 incident, according to Tarrant County criminal court records. His assaulting a peace officer charge was dismissed, but he was sentenced to 150 days in jail on the other two charges, according to court records.

Grimsley was previously convicted for murder in 2002 after beating his father to death with the butt of a shotgun in August 2001, records show. Tarrant County Medical Examiner records said George Grimsley's cause of death was homicide by manner of blunt force trauma.

Grimsley was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

WFAA has reached out to Grimsley’s attorneys, Kennedale police and Mansfield police to comment on the lawsuit. Grimsley is seeking a jury trial in the suit.

The Mansfield Police Department told WFAA it would not offer comment on pending littigation. The Kennedale Police Department told WFAA on Thursday ""we don’t have a comment at this time.""",Q2
https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/suspect-to-be-arraigned-in-2020-murder-dismemberment-later-this-month/,"Suspect to be arraigned in 2020 murder, dismemberment later this month","ALAMOGORDO, N.M. — A man at the center of a gruesome murder is expected to be arraigned on June 27 after recently being indicted on one count of second-degree murder.

Steven Gonzalez, 30, of Alamogordo will be arraigned on the murder charge on June 27 in U.S. District Court in Otero County, according to court records.

Gonzalez was indicted last week by a grand jury on one count of second-degree murder in the shooting death and dismemberment of Eddie Artiaga Jr., which happened almost three years ago. He already was facing one count of felon in possession of a firearm and possession of methamphetamine.

Scott Key, district attorney for New Mexico’s Twelfth Judicial District, said they had waited years for the lab results to come back in order to charge Gonzalez on the murder count.

Artiaga’s body was found decapitated and dismembered in Gonzalez’s trailer in the 400 block of Post Avenue on Sept. 25, 2020, when a parole officer and police went there to investigate possible parole violations. According to Key, Artiaga had been reported missing days before his body was found and was last seen alive on Sept. 18, 2020.

When police initially went to Gonzalez’s trailer, they found him inside high on methamphetamine.

They also discovered a .22 caliber handgun and some methamphetamine. He was arrested, but Key said at the time they did not know about the murder or the presence of a body in the trailer.

“So they took him and unbeknownst to them, I know they thought there was an unusual smell, but as soon as they arrested him they left,” Key said.

The body was later found after a relative of both Artiaga and Gonzalez went to clean up the trailer.

“And when that relative saw a little bit of blood spatter in the kitchen and on a floor register, she called the police that same day,” Key said.

When police arrived, they found multiple cutting tools in the trailer’s kitchen and made a grisly discovery in the bedroom.

“In Steven Gonzalez’s bedroom they found the five-gallon pails, multiple containers of blood, liquid, body parts, his head and a lot of skin and blood that came off of bones,” Key said.

Authorities later determined the cause of Artiaga’s death to be a gunshot to the head.

No motive is yet known, but Key said it is believed that Gonzalez and possibly Artiaga were on methamphetamine at the time.

“That probably led to whatever paranoia was going on in order to shoot Mr. Artiaga,” Key said.

Since his September 2020 arrest, Gonzalez has been held at the Otero County Detention Center for parole violations related to the methamphetamine and firearms possession charges.",Q2

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/us/oklahoma-abortion-ban-law-governor.html,Oklahoma Governor Signs Bill That Bans Most Abortions,"Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma signed a bill on Wednesday that bans nearly all abortions starting at fertilization. The new law, which takes effect immediately, is the most restrictive abortion ban in the country.

The law makes exceptions in cases where an abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest if they have been reported to law enforcement.

“From the moment life begins at conception is when we have a responsibility as human beings to do everything we can to protect that baby’s life and the life of the mother,” Mr. Stitt said after signing the bill into law. “If other states want to pass different laws, that is their right, but in Oklahoma we will always stand up for life.”

Passed by the Oklahoma Legislature last Thursday, the law relies on civilian enforcement to get around the constitutional right to abortion that was enshrined by the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.",Q2
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/family-13-year-old-boy-killed-san-antonio-police-want-officer-charged-rcna33486,"Family of 13-year-old boy killed by San Antonio police want officer charged with murder, attorney says","A lawyer representing the family of a 13-year-old boy who was killed by a San Antonio police officer earlier this month called for the officer’s arrest and indictment.

Lee Merritt said it is clear in video of the shooting that there was an “unjustified use of force” by officer Stephen Ramos when he shot Andre Hernandez Jr. while the teen was inside a car with two other teenagers. Andre died from his injuries at a hospital. Ramos has been placed on paid administrative duty.

“Stephen Ramos committed a crime on June 3 when he shot without provocation or without a proper justification into a vehicle full of children wounding and killing AJ Hernandez,” Merritt said on Tuesday. “Although we understand the investigation is ongoing, when there exists probable cause that a crime has occurred in the jurisdiction, the prosecutor’s office has the authority to issue arrest warrants.”

In a statement to NBC News, the district attorney’s office said the “incident is under an internal investigation by San Antonio police who will hand over their findings to the Bexar County District Attorney’s office.” The office said its civil rights division “will do a thorough review of the incident and then present it to a Grand Jury, which will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to send the case to a trial court.”

Merritt said Ramos should be charged with murder because pointing a “weapon at a 13-year-old suspect who represented no threat to anyone and pulling the trigger is consistent with a murder charge or some level of homicide indictment.”

San Antonio City Attorney Andy Segovia fired back at Merritt's assessment.

""Of course without waiting for the facts, Mr. Merritt will say the shooting was not justified, he is advocating for his client,"" Segovia said in a statement. ""We also expect any information shared publicly by Mr. Merritt concerning the video will be calculated to advance his perspective.""

According to earlier police statements, Andre intentionally crashed the car he was driving into a police vehicle, prompting Ramos to shoot into the teen’s car because he feared other officers would be struck.

However, that narrative was disputed by Merritt, who watched two police dashcam videos and footage from Ramos’ bodycam.

In describing the scene, Merritt said that both the car Andre was driving and the area around it were “very well lit” making it clear that the car was “occupied by children.” Merritt said the other passengers in the car were a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.

“The car was not traveling more than 2 to 5 miles per hour,” the lawyer said. “There was no ramming or crash, it was a bump.”

Merritt said no verbal warning was given and the shot, which went through an open window on the passenger side, occurred within one second.

The family is not seeking the public release of the video at this time due to its “graphic nature,” the attorney said.

Lynda Espinoza, the boy’s mother, has not seen the video and said the incident has been “traumatizing” and that she just wants justice for her son. Espinoza has said police took five days to tell her an officer shot Andre, leaving her to figure it out herself using news articles about the incident.

In addition to criminal charges for Ramos, Merritt said he intends to file a civil wrongful death suit against the officers involved as well as the city of San Antonio. The suit will allege Fourth Amendment violations for the use of deadly force and improper seizure.

It will also allege a pattern of abuse by the city, in part, for inappropriately training officers to follow policies and procedures that “don’t emphasize the value of preserving human life,” he said.

“The law requires officers to be brave enough to go hands-on when dealing with suspects that they can go hands-on with, but there was never any indication that anyone in this car was armed,” he said. “They were never aggressive or even disrespectful to these officers. Every child involved in this case showed greater composure than the law enforcement officers they came into contact with.”",Q2

https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2022/04/25/johnnie-jones-civil-rights-lawyer-and-wwii-veteran-dies/,"Johnnie Jones, civil rights lawyer and WWII veteran, dies","Listen to this article Listen to this article

Johnnie A. Jones Sr., a Louisiana civil rights attorney and World War II veteran who was wounded during the D-Day invasion of Normandy, has died. Jones was 102 years old.

Jones’ goddaughter, Mada McDonald, told WAFB-TV that Jones died Saturday at the Louisiana War Veterans’ Home in Jackson, Louisiana.

Jones was born Nov. 30, 1919 in Laurel Hill, Louisiana and raised on Rosemound Plantation by his parents, who farmed 73 acres of land but insisted that their son get an education. He graduated from Southern University and then was drafted in 1942. He became the Army’s first African American warrant officer. He was assigned to a unit responsible for unloading equipment and supplies onto Normandy.

During the June 6, 1944 invasion — as Jones came ashore on Omaha Beach — he came under fire from a German sniper. Jones grabbed his weapon and returned fire, a memory that haunted him all his life.

“I still see him, I see him every night,” Jones told The Associated Press in a 2019 interview.

Jones almost never made it to the beachhead that day. His ship hit a mine, and he was blown from the second deck to the first. The explosion, “blew me sky high into the air,” Jones was quoted as saying in an Department of Veterans Affairs interview. Later, Jones got hit with shrapnel when he didn’t hit the ground fast enough during a bomb attack.

By the end of World War II, more than a million African Americans were in uniform including the famed Tuskegee Airmen and the 761st Tank Battalion. But they returned from the war only to encounter discrimination back home.

Jones told the AP in 2019 that after returning from Europe, he had to move to the back of a bus filled with fellow soldiers as it crossed the Mason-Dixon line separating North from South.

“I couldn’t sit with the soldiers I had been on the battlefield with. I had to go to the back of the bus,” said Jones. Moreover, while traveling to New Orleans to get shrapnel removed from his neck, Jones was pulled over by a white police officer and roughed up.

Such events served as a call to action, to fight racism. He obtained a law degree and was recruited in 1953 to help organize a bus boycott in Baton Rouge and defend the participants. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King used that event to plan his larger bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, several years later.

Jones also defended students arrested during sit-ins as civil rights protests gained momentum in the South. His car was bombed twice.

The French government in 2020 presented Jones with the Legion of Honor award for his World War II service.

It took decades for Jones’ sacrifice and courage during World War II to be recognized. In 2021 — at age 101 — he finally received a Purple Heart, which is awarded to U.S. service members killed or wounded in action.

The Louisiana Digital Library has an interview with Jones on its website.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eli-hart-dead-trunk-mother-julissa-thaler-arrested-minnesota/,Mother charged after her 6-year-old son is found dead in car trunk in Minneapolis suburb,"A Minnesota mother has been charged in the death of her 6-year-old son after police found his body in the trunk of her car, CBS Minnesota reports. The 28-year-old, Julissa Thaler, was charged with second-degree murder, according to CBS Minnesota.

Orono police say they stopped a car Friday morning after a caller reported the car had a shattered rear window and blown out tire. In a criminal complaint, officers aid they saw what appeared to be blood on Thaler's hand, a shotgun shell and a bullet hole in the back seat, according to CBS Minnesota. Orono Chief of Police Correy Farniok revealed when officers stopped the woman driving, the blood inside the car lead them to a body in the trunk.

While police have not released the name of the victim or the two people they say they've arrested since, multiple family members have identified the boy in the trunk as Eli Hart. An online jail roster in Hennepin County shows Hart's biological mother, Thaler, was arrested by Orono police early Saturday morning on pending murder charges.

According to CBS Minnesota, Thaler was released from the scene before officers found the body. When police officers went to her apartment to arrest her, they found her clothes in the washer and Thaler trying to leave on foot, according to the complaint. Officers also found evidence of a shooting at a gas station where Thaler's car had been seen, according to CBS Minnesota. When the station was searched, officers found evidence of a shooting, including blood, and a backpack.

A bloody child booster seat which had ""sustained damage consistent with a shotgun blast,"" was also found by police, according to CBS Minnesota.

Family members have identified 6-year-old Eli Hart as the boy found dead in a car trunk near Orono Friday.

Dakota County court documents portray the last two years of Hart's life centered around an ongoing custody battle between Thaler and his biological father, Tory Hart. In January of 2021, records show Eli Hart was placed into family foster care after concerns regarding his mother's mental health grew.

""It was just expanding our hearts to accept him as our own child,"" said Nikita Kronberg, whose family took Hart in for almost a year. ""He was an amazing kid. He was full of energy, always smiling. So outgoing. He always wanted to befriend everyone.""

Kronberg's husband, Stephen, is Thaler's cousin. She says she was concerned about Thaler once again regaining full custody at the conclusion of the Child Protective Services investigation.

""I feared if she got custody back, that she would harm Eli, if not worse,"" Kronberg said Sunday. ""I instantly responded with, you know, this is a dangerous situation for Eli. You know, I fear for his safety if he's returned to her. There's numerous things I had brought up that were concerning that I had noticed.""

Dakota County court documents show concerns about Thaler's mental health, living situation and criminal history. The case was closed and she was awarded sole custody less than two weeks before her arrest.

""At that point, I felt like I failed (Eli),"" said Kronberg, who has two children of her own. ""I keep looking at pictures of him and I think this can't be real. He's out there somewhere playing, having fun. It can't be real.""

Kronberg says her biggest question is why.

""You want to blame one person,"" she said. ""You want to put that blame on one person so you have somebody to be mad at. But it's a whole team.""

Kronberg told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Dakota County social workers ""failed this child big-time."" The social worker in charge of the case didn't immediately respond to messages from the newspaper.",Q2
https://www.insider.com/amber-heard-personality-disorders-violence-partner-johnny-depp-2022-4,"Amber Heard had personality disorders linked to violence and 'making up stories,' a clinical psychologist who evaluated her says","A clinical psychologist who evaluated Amber Heard testified in Johnny Depp's trial against her.

She said Heard ""was grossly exaggerating"" PTSD symptoms and downplayed Heard's personal issues.

Heard had disorders associated with violence toward romantic partners, the psychologist said.

A forensic clinical psychologist who evaluated Amber Heard testified in court Tuesday that she diagnosed the actor with borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder.

The scores Heard received on professional psychological tests were associated with people who were ""full of rage"" and ""socially sophisticated,"" Shannon Curry, the psychologist, said.

""These people might have that anger kind of explode out at times,"" Curry said. ""They tend to be very passive-aggressive. They may be self-indulgent, very self-centered. They could use manipulation tactics to try to get their needs met. They're very needy of attention, acceptance, approval.""

Curry was called to the witness stand by lawyers for Johnny Depp, who is suing Heard. He alleges Heard defamed him when she described herself as a victim of domestic violence in 2018 — a characterization that Depp denies. His lawsuit also alleges that Heard physically and verbally abused him throughout their relationship until their 2016 divorce. Heard has doubled down on her allegations with a countersuit.

Prior to the trial, a different psychologist had diagnosed Heard with post-traumatic stress disorder, which she attributed to her relationship with Depp. After Heard disclosed the evaluation in court filings, Depp's lawyers convinced the judge overseeing the case to allow them to retain Curry for a separate evaluation.

Curry evaluated Heard for 12 hours in December over two days and analyzed earlier treatment records, recordings, and other documentation her lawyers provided, she said. Curry said Heard ""did not have PTSD"" and appeared to be ""grossly exaggerating"" symptoms.

""She initially said, 'Yes, I have 19 of the 20 symptoms.' That's not typical, even of somebody with the most disabling form of PTSD,"" Curry said on the stand in the Fairfax, Virginia, courthouse where the trial is taking place. ""When we eventually sort of dialed it down, there were three remaining symptoms.""

She diagnosed Heard with other psychological disorders.

""The results of Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses: borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder,"" Curry said.

Heard may have feared abandonment

The evaluations, Curry said, involved looking into Heard's home life, her relationship with her family — which Heard has said involved abuse — school life, friendships, career history, and other personal relationships. Among the tests she used was the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, commonly known as the MMPI-2, which is used to diagnose personality disorders.

Related stories

Curry said she prepared a 25-page interpretation following the test. She concluded that Heard had ""a very sophisticated way of minimizing any personal problems,"" while having ""a lot of inner hostility"" and externalizing blame.

Borderline personality disorder, Curry said, is a disorder of ""instability"" in personal relationships, emotions, and a person's sense of self. A driving factor, she said, is the ""underlying terror of abandonment.""

""When somebody is afraid of being abandoned by their partner or by anybody else in their environment, and they have this disorder, they'll make desperate attempts to prevent that from happening,"" Curry said. ""And those desperate attempts could be physical aggression.""

She added that borderline personality disorder was ""a predictive factor for women who implement violence against their partner.""

""If their partner wants to get space from all of this intense emotion, oftentimes, they will be abusive to their partners in these situations,"" Curry said. ""Sometimes, they'll physically restrain them from leaving and become injured that way.""

People with the disorder can express ""explosive anger"" as a result of perceived slights, Curry said, in a way that can be ""exhausting for their partners.""

""Oftentimes, their partners will try to make them happy at first and really allow themselves to be a punching bag, thinking that they can somehow solve this problem, that somehow they can make this better,"" Curry said. ""And eventually, it just overwhelms them.""

Curry's assessment resembles the testimony of Laurel Anderson, a therapist who oversaw marriage-counseling sessions with Depp and Heard. Anderson said earlier in the trial that Heard dominated conversations and had poor listening skills.

Depp's relationship with Heard, Anderson said, triggered ""mutual abuse"" among the couple. Anderson added that Heard told her she ""escalated"" arguments to violence if she was afraid Depp would leave her. Other witnesses said they sometimes saw Heard physically cling to Depp when he tried to walk away from an argument.

""You're going to see a lot of this escalation in the bizarre behavior,"" Curry said on Tuesday. ""They can react violently. They can react aggressively. They will often physically prevent their partner from trying to leave.""

'They might take the victim role or the princess role, and even make up stories'

Depp testified earlier in the trial that he planned to leave Heard, after years of constant fighting, following the death of his mother. Heard preempted that by filing a restraining order that included photos of her bruised face, in an incident she blamed on Depp but which Depp and his employees testified was fabricated.

According to Curry, people with borderline personality disorder often ""make threats using the legal system"" when threatened with abandonment.

""They might say that they are going to file a restraining order or claim abuse, or they might do these things, to essentially try to keep their partner from leaving,"" Curry said. ""In the moment, they're not consciously thinking, 'I'm going to keep my partner from leaving right now.' They're just thinking, 'I can't stand this. I hate my partner.'""

Curry added: ""They went from idealizing to suddenly devaluing because of the hurt. And they'll do anything to express that big emotion of anger.""

The psychologist also said Heard approached her evaluation in a way that downplayed her psychological issues.

""She approached it in a manner that very clearly minimized any psychological dysfunction. Not just that, but really presented herself as free of any problems,"" Curry said. ""And she did so in a way that was very sophisticated, not obvious, by responding to questions that most people might not notice are trying to detect that.""

Dr. Shannon Curry, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testifies at the trial on Tuesday. Brendan Smialowski/Pool via REUTERS

Heard's MMPI test produced a ""code type"" associated with ""cruelty,"" Curry said, as well as people who are ""very attention-seeking"" and ""prone to externalizing blame, to a point where it's unclear whether they can even admit to themselves that they do have responsibility.""

Curry said the results demonstrated that Heard could see herself as an ""avenger against injustice"" without seeing her own faults.

""They have a capacity to kind of offer some of their faults but only the ones that people think of lightly and can all relate to,"" she said. ""And so they can present as very fair and balanced, but in actuality, they really might be very judgmental of others and unaware of problems in their behavior around their thinking.""

Before Depp finished his testimony on Monday, he said on the stand that Heard was jealous of his friendship with Paul Bettany. The ""WandaVision"" actor was such a threat to Heard, Depp said, that she once drove Bettany's 18-year-old stepson to tears in an argument.

People with histrionic personality disorder, Curry said, often want to be the center of attention even when they have little to say. When they see the attention of people around them waning, they may make up stories, Curry said.

""They might take the victim role or the princess role, and even make up stories,"" Curry said. ""Sometimes, those are to bolster the victim role. Sometimes, those stories are just to make them look more interesting or accomplished in their mind so that they can get respect and attention that way.""

Ryan Reavis, 39, pleaded guilty last year to a federal count of distribution of fentanyl, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Two others were also charged. Stephen Walter, 49, of Westwood, pleaded guilty to the distribution charge and is awaiting sentencing. The case against Cameron Pettit, 30, of West Hollywood, is pending.

On Sept. 4, 2018, at the direction of Walter, Reavis supplied counterfeit oxycodone pills to the third defendant, according to papers filed in Los Angeles federal court.



Reavis admitted knowing that the pills contained fentanyl or some other controlled substance. Shortly after Reavis handed over the fentanyl-laced pills, Pettit allegedly supplied the pills to Malcolm McCormick -- who recorded and performed under the name Mac Miller -- two days before the 26-year-old rapper suffered a fatal overdose in Studio City on Sept. 7, 2018, federal prosecutors said.

Miller began rapping at 14 and built a large following before signing with the label of fellow Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa.

Joan Elizabeth Means Khabele was an activist and scholar from Austin. Her courageous act of swimming in Barton Springs to protest segregation at the pool sparked the civil rights era swim-ins that eventually led to the desegregation of Barton Springs Pool.

The event will be on Saturday, April 9 from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.

There will be free entry to the pool before 12 p.m. and free valet parking from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Residents who plan to attend should note that swimming will pause from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.

The event honoring Joan Means Khabele will include a proclamation, speakers, and a water blessing ceremony performed by Geraldo Perez. The PBS documentary featuring Khabele talking about her swim at Barton Springs will also be screened at the pool.

There will be listening booths set up for community members to share oral histories and personal experiences regarding race and Barton Springs, according to a press release on the event. The oral histories will become part of an exhibit, virtual and physical, that will be featured on-site at the Beverly S. Sheffield Education Center.

In her senior year, she was a student leader in activism that led to the integration of Barton Springs and Zilker Park. After not being allowed to swim at her high school senior picnic, she was the first Black person to jump into Barton Springs Pool in an act of civil disobedience. In doing so, she sparked a movement of swim-ins that took place on a weekly basis throughout the summer of 1960.

https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2022/06/15/the-owo-tragedy-fallouts/,THE OWO TRAGEDY FALLOUTS – THISDAYLIVE,"There is need for a thorough investigation of the mayhem

Last Thursday, the federal government blamed the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), an ISIL-affiliated armed group, for the June 5 attack that killed dozens of worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State. The Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, who dispelled the notion that the heinous attack was due to “ethno-religious thing,” said the security agencies had located the “imprints of the Islamic State of West Africa Province.” While we commiserate with families of the deceased and wish quick recovery for the wounded victims, it is unfortunate that investigation into the killings is now marred by a needless controversy.

The scepticism about ISWAP being responsible for the killings is understandable. That the vicious armed group which loves publicity is yet to claim credit for the attack is quite unusual. Besides, many experts have given opinions about why, both in style and substance, the attack could not have been carried out by ISWAP. This perhaps explains why the Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, said the federal government was hasty in reaching conclusion about the brains behind the deadly attack. Akeredolu told a Swiss-based Christian human rights Organisation, Christian Solidarity International (CSI) that since ISWAP is known for claiming responsibility for their attacks, he doesn’t agree with the conclusion. “ISWAP don’t hide their attacks. If they have done it, they would have owned up. We are yet to know their identity and our security people are still on their trail,” Akeredolu said.

The families of the dozens of people who were killed in cold blood inside a church deserve justice for their loved ones. And the authorities must ensure a thorough investigation for that to happen. However, whatever may be their misgivings, nobody should exonerate ISWAP that has been credited for several deadly attacks not only in the Northeast but in other areas as well. Last month, the terror group claimed responsibility for an assault on a cultural event in Kogi State, and for a bombing in Taraba State that claimed 30 casualties. Some security analysts have noted the possibility of its expansion to the southern part of the country.

There is no doubt that the canvass of insecurity is broadening with large scale and unexplained violence in many communities across the country. While some analysts say the expansion of armed groups in the south is unlikely to materialise because of a lack of local support and inadequate logistics, the Commander of the United States Special Operations Command in Africa, Major General Dagvin Anderson, once raised the alarm that ISIS and Al-Quaeda were penetrating new territories across the country, and on the verge of furthering their terrorist campaigns to the south of Nigeria. Anderson particularly warned that these threats should not be underestimated, and that the terrorists could seize “opportunities” and weaknesses as they emerge.

However, the Army Defence Headquarters had downplayed the threats, arguing that Anderson was raising an unnecessary alarm. But as things stand, the entire country is indeed gradually being sucked in by various terrorist groups and vicious criminals. In the Northeast that is under the siege of insurgents, more than 40,000 persons have been killed and millions of others rendered homeless. The Northwest is also coming increasingly under the vice grip of bandits and other criminal gangs.

The announcement that ISWAP was responsible for the Owo attack should put the authorities on high alert. Opening a frontier of religion-induced terror in the southern part of the country raises the prospect of danger. Sectarian violence with ethnic colouration that such infiltration would represent is a recipe for disaster. The federal government must do all within its power to combat such threat.",Q2

Greg Abbott said.

Abbott said a local man opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, about 85 miles west of San Antonio. It was the deadliest school shooting in Texas history and occurred four years after a gunman fatally shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area.

”He shot and killed, horrifically, incomprehensibly, 14 students and killed a teacher,"" said the governor, adding that two officers were shot and wounded but were expected to survive.

The gunman was a resident of the community and entered the school with a handgun, and possibly a rifle, and opened fire, Abbott said. He said the shooter was likely killed by responding officers but that the events were still being investigated.

It was not immediately clear how many people, in addition to the dead, were injured in the shooting. Earlier, Uvalde Memorial Hospital said 13 children were taken there. Another hospital reported a 66-year-old woman was in critical condition.",Q2
https://fox23maine.com/news/local/employees-of-accused-maine-fraudster-didnt-know-what-his-businesses-actually-did,Employees of accused Maine fraudster didn't know what his businesses actually did,"BANGOR () -- Jaime Lawler wanted to move back to Maine after living and working in New Hampshire, so she answered an ad from a company called First Class Pool and Grass in Bangor seeking an office assistant.

“I assumed it was a pool-cleaning and lawn-cutting business in an office,” she said. “It looked legit.”

But she started questioning the situation on her first day, April 4. Her boss, Nathan Reardon, told her to meet him at the former Sears building at the Bangor Mall, where he is renting space and has been engaged in a fight with the city that has led officials to condemn that section of the property.

Also read:

Lawler, 45, of Dixmont said Reardon took her up to an office and told her to fill an empty fish tank with water, which she did.

Later that day, Reardon, 44, sent her and another employee to an unmarked office on the second-floor of a building in downtown Bangor.

“There were a couple of desks and a couple of computers there, but no telephones,” Lawler said.

There, Reardon asked Lawler to get him a cup of coffee, and call an insurance company for a coverage quote. But he told her to say the business was a software company, not a pool-cleaning enterprise, she said.

“I was getting a really bad vibe from this guy, so I left at 1 p.m. on Tuesday [April 5],” Lawler said. “I texted him to say, ‘Thank you but this job is not for me.’”

She still hasn’t been paid, Lawler said Thursday. The business that supposedly hired her, First Class Pool and Grass, isn’t registered as a corporate entity in Maine or Florida, where Reardon has filed documents for other enterprises.

Interviews with Reardon’s former employees shed more light on the unfolding story of a sprawling and bizarre business empire that includes dozens of companies, a trail of debt to nearly 100 former employees, $100,000 in fines for labor violations and one federal fraud case for alleged misuse of pandemic Paycheck Protection Program money.

Employees said they accepted jobs with Reardon but never understood what his businesses actually did. They described unsafe conditions, including in buildings where local officials had found code violations. They said Reardon assigned them seemingly random tasks that didn’t align with their job descriptions. And many say they are still owed money.

Reardon lists more than 60 businesses in the portfolio on his website, including a massage parlor; a law firm; and automotive, coffee and hardware businesses. But the Bangor Daily News could find only six with active corporate registrations — four in Florida and two in Maine, including his now-closed Taco Shack restaurant in Newburgh, where the state Department of Labor found he paid more than 40 employees late.

Reardon hasn’t responded to requests for comment from the BDN in recent weeks. On Friday, he texted a reporter a photo of a Maine Judicial Branch receipt showing he had sued BDN parent company Bangor Publishing Co. The BDN confirmed that Reardon, acting as his own lawyer, filed the lawsuit in Penobscot County Superior Court on Friday. He sued the parent company of News Center Maine, alleging defamation, late last year.

Samantha Townsend, 22, who now lives in Baker City, Oregon, worked for Reardon for a month in the fall of 2019 as a personal assistant at 54 Perry Road in Bangor. Reardon told her that he planned to renovate the building to do auto repair and transmission work, but also spoke of including a massage parlor and a recording studio there.

Also read:

None of the businesses ever opened, she said.

The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Reardon in 2018 for safety violations at the Perry Road location. The agency found that his business, Ultimate Equity Holdings, lacked proper egress and that lighting did not meet safety standards. Bangor’s code enforcement office has also found violations at that property.

Townsend said that Reardon had her search for a business award he could apply to win, find a world record he could top, research worldwide statistics on clean drinking water, find options for burial plots for his family in Maine and Florida, print and frame portraits of famous CEOs and entrepreneurs, and start a podcast.

“He gave no direction concerning what the podcast would be about or who would host,” she said. “Any time I asked for clarification on a task, I would be ignored. It became apparent that the majority of these tasks were the disconnected threads of a fraying business that I needed to leave immediately.”

The Maine Human Rights Commission is separately suing two of Reardon’s businesses after finding reasonable grounds to conclude he discriminated against a different former female employee when he suggested in a text message that he go to her home to get a massage.

Townsend said that Reardon asked her about a massage shortly before she quit.

“Being a personal assistant, I was under the impression that what he was asking me to do was find him a reputable massage therapist in the Bangor area,” she said.

It only became clear to Townsend later that he was actually asking her to massage him, she said.

When she gave her notice, Reardon told her that his car, parked outside the Perry Road business, “was broken down” and insisted that she drive him to the Brewer home where he was living.

“The entire ride to his home, Reardon insisted on complimenting me and speaking to me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said. “When we arrived, his wife was standing on the porch. She glared at me intensely, to which Reardon made comments about how she didn’t like to see him with such young, attractive girls and continued to say that as an assistant, I was ‘more qualified to meet his needs.’”

Townsend quit after she said Reardon made her work in a mildewed recreational vehicle heated by a propane stove that he would often switch off as it grew cold in November. She was never paid for her last two weeks of work, she said.

Unlike some of Reardon’s former employees, Daniel Watson, 32, of Madison has reported his former boss’ business practices to local and state authorities. He also sued Reardon in small claims court in an effort to collect $8,000 he’s owed for construction work on a commercial building in Skowhegan, the Perry Road building and a Howland apartment house.

Also read:

Watson is just one of 17 people and two firms owed money for an estimated $22,000 worth of work done between Aug. 14, 2020, and Feb. 27, 2021, on a commercial property in Skowhegan, according to Somerset County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney. She has charged Reardon with theft of services, a Class B crime.

He has pleaded not guilty to that charge and to five counts of bank fraud, three counts of attempted wire fraud, two counts of making false statements to a bank and one count of perjury related to the Paycheck Protection Program fraud case filed in federal court.

Reardon has a Maine criminal record that dates back to 1999, and other legal actions against him stretch from his early business dealings in Florida — where he registered more than 20 entities between 2009 and 2021 — to more recent dealings in Maine. The cases include eviction proceedings in which landlords sought to remove Reardon and his businesses from their properties to companies’ attempts to force Reardon to pay outstanding bills.

On his criminal record is a 2013 conviction from his guilty plea to misdemeanor charges stemming from a failure to hand over Maine sales tax and employees’ withholding taxes to the state when he ran Performance Auto and Diesel in Kennebec County.

Also read:

Reardon was sentenced to one year behind bars but was administratively released and ordered to pay $49,837 in restitution to the state. The last public disclosure of his balance was in 2017, when he still owed $27,537, according to the Maine attorney general’s office.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams is heckled by furious parents as he attends Broadway show,"NYC mayor Eric Adams was confronted by parents furious at his decision to extend a mask mandate for under-5s as he hit the town for a Broadway show.

Adams, who has quickly become known for rubbing shoulders with celebrities, was met with angry chants of 'Unmask our kids!' as he attended the Paradise Square Broadway Musical at Ethel Barrymore Theater Sunday night.

A handful of women held up signs as Adams entered the building wearing a gray KN95 mask. The latest twist in New York City's masking saga for under-5's began Friday, when Adams said he was delaying plans to lift the rule from April 4.

A state judge struck down the indefinite mask rule for under5-s the same day.

That lawmaker called it 'arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable' and therefore 'void and unenforceable.'

But Adams successfully requested a stay to pursue an appeal just hours later.

He has angered parents with a whirl of social events, including a party with Cara Delevingne at the new One Vanderbilt skyscraper last week, as well as a trip to see Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband Matthew Broderick appear in Broadway play Plaza Suite.

Adams also attended the white tie Gridiron Dinner on Saturday in Washington D.C. with a long list of politicians and journalists.

'Unmask our babies!' they yelled, as the 61-year-old entered the Barrymore Theater for a performance of Paradise Square.

Since the pandemic begun two years ago, nationwide 363 children aged four and under have died of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes.

Of the 979,158 to have died in the United States, over half - 503,404 - were aged 75 or older.

The vast majority of the rest - 434,457 people - were aged 45 to 74.

On Twitter, parents voiced their frustration at Adams's clinging to the mask mandates for the youngest - who are still not eligible for the COVID vaccine.

'RECALL Eric Adams @NYCMayor @NYCMayorsOffice. He is a fraud and a fake,' tweeted one, with a video of the mayor dancing alongside model Cara Delevingne at a promotional event for a Wells Fargo credit card on March 28.

'He lied to get elected and now he has attacked our children & CONDEMNED THEM TO SUFFOCATING MASKS WHILE HE FRICKING PARTIES MASKLESS all night long.

'Parents stand up for your children.'

COVID cases have ticked slightly upwards in NYC in recent weeks, but still fall far short of their festive Omicron peak

Children are NOT at serious risk from Covid, multiple studies show Multiple studies have shown young children are not at serious risk from Covid-19. Data from from American Academy of Pediatrics shows children accounted for about 19 percent of all COVID cases, but less than 0.26% of cases resulted in death. A study from October found that around half of pediatric Covid cases are asymptomatic, and that was before the more mild Omicron variant became dominant in the U.S. Hospitalizations of pediatric COVID patients are also rare. A study in February, found the Pfizer vaccine was only 12% effective at preventing Omicron in five- to 11- year-olds. The main argument in favor of vaccinating children is to prevent them from spreading the virus but researchers from University of Berlin found, on average, children release less Covid particles into the air. Experts believe people who release lower amounts of aerosol particles when speaking have smaller viral loads, which also means they do not spread the virus at the same level. Advertisement

Another added: 'You force masks on children. F*** you, you belong in prison.'

Campaigner Emma Woodhouse said: 'Toddlers in NYC will be forcibly masked in Monday, and the unmasked man on the left is responsible.'

New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz, meanwhile, tweeted: 'I can't believe I have to say this in April of 2022: unmask the toddlers, you lunatics.'

Adams said that he decided to reinstate masks for the youngsters amid concern about the latest variant, BA.2.

'We're recommending to wait a little bit longer before making masks optional for this age group,' said the city's health commissioner, Dr Ashwin Vasan.

'We're looking for the earliest opportunity to do this safely and we can assure you the day is coming for your children.'

New York City's 'alert level' is green, indicating a low risk.

COVID hospitalizations for children under 18 have remained steady 0.5 per 100,000.

Markowicz wrote: 'Meanwhile, the over-70 set is at 4.7 per 100,000, and they can traipse around the city maskless licking lampposts and snogging strangers.

'If it sounds like it doesn't make sense, that's because it doesn't and never has.'

Michael Chessa, attorney for the parents challenging Adams's mandate, was also angered.

He told The New York Post: 'These mandates are anti-science, anti-child, anti-parent and, according to last week's court decision, against the law.

'Each day that goes by where Mayor Adams keeps these mandates in place is a stain on his legacy.'

GALVESTON, Texas — Two children were killed early Saturday when their Galveston home caught fire.

Galveston firefighters were called to the home on Avenue K near 21st Street around 2:40 a.m., but there was no immediate word on the circumstances surrounding the fire.

A medical examiner on Monday identified the two children as 2-year-old Logan Jones and 3-year-old Jade.

They were pulled from the home by firefighters and were taken to UTMB Health's Trauma Center at John Sealy Hospital where they both died.

The children were in a back bedroom of the house at the time, according to a neighbor.

The father of the children was able to escape and was not hurt, Galveston Assistant Fire Chief Richie Pearson said. His identity has yet to be released but officials confirmed he was a firefighter with the Galveston Fire Department.

It wasn't immediately clear how the fire started. The Galveston Fire Marshal is investigating the cause.

A relative told KHOU 11 that the family is working to pick up the pieces.

Roosevelt High School rising sophomore Nathan Arens and Mollie Kruse, who just finished eighth grade at Ben Reifel Middle School and will be a freshman at Washington High School next year, both had projects selected to be shown in virtual showcases at the Smithsonian.

Arens’ 10-minute documentary, “John Brown’s Death and How It Caused the End of Slavery,” is shown in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Kruse’s exhibit, “Who Owns The Black Hills,” is shown in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.

Their projects are part of a National History Day contest, which is a year-long academic program focused on historical research, interpretation and creative expression for those in grades 6-12.

By participating in NHD, students become writers, filmmakers, web designers, playwrights and artists as they create unique contemporary expressions of history. The experience consists of a series of contests at the local and affiliate levels and culminates in an annual national competition in the nation's capital in June.

Arens said he started learning about the subject of his project, John Brown, in his eighth grade social studies class and explains how he was a radical abolitionist in the fight against slavery, and “acted like a martyr.”

He used interviews, articles and research he found online about John Brown, including museum articles and firsthand accounts from John Brown’s lifetime, Arens said, estimating he did a total of 24 hours of research across a couple of months.

“I’ve always been interested in history, so it’s always been fun and fascinating to me,” he said.

Kruse’s project ties directly to South Dakota history. She said if she had to answer the title of her project in just a few words, the Black Hills are “likely meant to be Lakota land, but, as of now, it’s the U.S. because of everything they’ve done.”

Her exhibit started as a class project that she “went crazy on, because I’m a big history buff.” She estimated she researched for three months and used databases, resources at the Augustana University library and online articles to put her research together.

Kruse’s project explains how multiple Native American tribes inhabited the Black Hills before settlers claimed the land, and explains how treaties like the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, the battle of Little Bighorn and the Wounded Knee Massacre impacted relationships between Indigenous people and white settlers.

“I want to help show the real reason and really what happened on the Black Hills land,” Kruse says in the video presentation of her exhibit. “I also want to shed light on those innocent people who lost their lives at Wounded Knee. This is just a small piece of the ongoing issues between the U.S. and Native Americans across the U.S.”

Danyelle Cleveland, Kruse’s eighth grade American history teacher at BRMS, said she’s excited for both Kruse and Arens because she’s had students participate in the NHD program for seven years; some have gone to the national level with their projects, but she’s never had a student recognized specifically by an organization in D.C.

“To me, it’s quite the honor,” she said. “To be recognized by a specific organization is incredible. I love that (Kruse) chose a subject area that deserves to receive the attention.”

Cleveland said she appreciated Kruse’s tenacity to not quit when she struggled to find some parts of her research, her drive to keep finding answers, and her ability to ask lots of questions.",Q2
https://www.dl-online.com/news/minnesota/keith-ellison-vows-to-protect-out-of-state-women-seeking-abortions-in-minnesota,Keith Ellison vows to protect out-of-state women seeking abortions in Minnesota,"ST. PAUL — As the U.S. Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, Minnesota's attorney general says women who travel to the state seeking an abortion will be protected from lawsuits and prosecution.

Addressing reporters in St. Paul Tuesday, June 21, Attorney General Keith Ellison said he will intervene in action by states where abortion is illegal against anyone seeking abortions in Minnesota. While no state currently has an abortion travel ban on the books, lawmakers in states with restrictive abortion laws have floated such restrictions. Already, a Texas abortion law that bans the procedure after the sixth week of pregnancy allows private citizens to sue abortion providers and individuals who get abortions.

“No one who travels from another state to seek an abortion that’s legal in Minnesota is going to be prosecuted,” he said. “I will oppose extradition requests from other states for people who’ve engaged in legal conduct in Minnesota.”

With a Supreme Court decision on abortion possible this week, the attorney general, joined by Planned Parenthood North Central States president and CEO Sarah Stoesz, as well as Hamline-Mitchell College of Law professor Michael Steenson, offered a brief on what a post-Roe Minnesota could look like.

If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the question of abortion’s legality would be returned to the states, whose policies on the practice vary widely, Steenson explained. Minnesota is surrounded by states with more restrictive abortion laws and stands to become a regional destination for abortions. Stoesz said Planned Parenthood in Minnesota expects a 10% to 25% increase in patients when abortion is banned in surrounding states.

“We are stepping up as fast as we can so that we are able to make appointments available to everyone that needs them,” Stoesz said. “Of course, staffing is a major challenge for all in health care and all employers generally.”

No one who travels from another state to seek an abortion that’s legal in Minnesota is going to be prosecuted. I will oppose extradition requests from other states for people who’ve engaged in legal conduct in Minnesota. Keith Ellison, Minnesota attorney general

The future of U.S. abortion rights has been in question since the 6-3 conservative majority Supreme Court took up a case on the constitutionality of Mississippi’s ban on abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy. A draft opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito leaked in May showed the court was poised to side with the state, overturning 50 years of judicial precedent protecting abortion rights on the federal level.

In anticipation of the high court’s decision, Planned Parenthood said it has already ceased performing abortions in South Dakota, where a so-called trigger law would make the procedure illegal the minute federal protections end. In North Dakota, providers would have one month to end procedures before that state’s law banning abortion goes into effect. Wisconsin also has an abortion ban that would go into effect should Roe be overturned.

Iowa’s Supreme Court last week overturned its precedent protecting abortion rights, clearing the path for restrictive legislation to pass should the state’s Republican governor and Republican-controlled Legislature decide to move forward with restrictions or an outright ban.

Even if federal abortion protections end, abortion rights in Minnesota are still protected under the 1995 state Supreme Court decision Doe v. Gomez. Taking note of the region’s circumstances and the potential threat to Roe, Planned Parenthood had started expanding its capacity in Minnesota several years ago, Stoesz said.

“If the federal protection falls, it is on us to make sure that we are good neighbors to those around us and that we are able to welcome women into our state so that they can be cared for as they need,” she said.

In addition to his pledge to protect abortion-seekers in Minnesota, Ellison’s office has also released new guidance to abortion providers on the potential post-Roe legal landscape.",Q2
http://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.php?ID=192639,US Supreme Court rules against Maine's ban on tuition aid to religious schools,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled 6-3 that Maine's policy barring students in a student-aid program from using their aid to attend ""sectarian"" schools violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.



""Regardless of how the benefit and restriction are described, the program operates to identify and exclude otherwise eligible schools on the basis of their religious exercise,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the June 21 decision in Carson v. Makin.



He added that ""a neutral benefit program in which public funds flow to religious organizations through the independent choices of private benefit recipients does not offend the Establishment Clause.""



""Maine's decision to continue excluding religious schools from its tuition assistance program ... thus promotes stricter separation of church and state than the Federal Constitution requires.""



Roberts noted that Maine ""pays tuition for certain students at private schools-- so long as the schools are not religious. That is discrimination against religion. A State's antiestablishment interest does not justify enactments that exclude some members of the community from an otherwise generally available public benefit because of their religious exercise.""



Having chosen to fund private schools through its aid program, Roberts said, Maine cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.

The case was brought by the Carson family, consisting of parents Amy and David and their daughter Olivia, who reside in Glenburn, Maine. Because Glenburn has no public school system, families with school-age children are eligible for a school-choice program that pays tuition at either public or non-sectarian schools.



About 5,000 Maine students are eligible for this program, which excludes private schools that are ""??associated with a particular faith or belief system and which, in addition to teaching academic subjects, promotes the faith or belief system with which it is associated and/or presents the material taught through the lens of this faith,"" which Maine considers ""sectarian"".



The Carson parents are alumni of Bangor Christian Schools, a K-12 school in the nearby city of Bangor. But because Bangor Christian Schools mandates Bible class, it is ineligible for the town tuition program, meaning the Carsons have to pay for Olivia's tuition.



The Carsons, along with two other Maine families seeking to send their children to ""sectarian"" schools, filed suit in 2018.



The Carson v. Makin decision referred to other recent rulings on free exercise and and equal protection.



In its June 2020 decision Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, the court struck down as a violation of the free exercise clause a state scholarship program that excluded religious schools. And in 2017, the court found in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer that a church-owned playground can be eligible for a public benefit program.



Dissenting from the decision on Tuesday were Justices Stephen Breyer, who was joined by Elena Kagan, and in part, by Sonia Sotomayor, who also filed a dissenting opinion.



Breyer argued that the interpretation of the First Amendment advanced by the majority opinion will work against its ""general purpose,"" which he said is ""to allow for an American society with practitioners of over 100 different religions, and those who do not practice religion at all, to live together without serious risk of religion-based social divisions.""



He also argued that Maine ""excludes schools from its tuition program not because of the schools' religious character but because the schools will use the funds to teach and promote religious ideals.""



""State funding of religious activity risks the very social conflict based upon religion that the Religion Clauses were designed to prevent. And, unlike the circumstances present in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, it is religious activity, not religious labels, that lies at the heart of this case,"" Breyer maintained.



Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, called the majority opinion ""another blow to bigoted and arcane anti-Catholic laws. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that parents want and deserve better school choices for their kids. Religious families, and even families that aren't religious but see the value in faith-based schools, should not be cut out from programs that help parents make the best educational choice for their kids. Maine's law and others like it especially hurt low-income children who suffer the most in failed schools. Today's win helps to end anti-religious discrimination and expands sorely-needed school choice for low-income families.""



Kelly Shackelford, president of First Liberty Institute, a law firm focused on religious freedom, commented: ""We are thrilled that the Court affirmed once again that religious discrimination will not be tolerated in this country. Parents in Maine, and all over the country, can now choose the best education for their kids without fearing retribution from the government.""



The Second Vatican Council's 1965 declaration on Christian education, Gravissimum educationis, said that parents ""must enjoy true liberty in their choice of schools.""



""Consequently, the public power, which has the obligation to protect and defend the rights of citizens, must see to it, in its concern for distributive justice, that public subsidies are paid out in such a way that parents are truly free to choose according to their conscience the schools they want for their children.""

https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/04/19/xzto-a19.html,"Demonstrations continue in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in response to the police murder of Patrick Lyoya","A fourth day of demonstrations took place in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday evening in protest against the police murder of 26-year-old black man Patrick Lyoya on April 4. The brutal killing of the young auto parts worker on the southeast side of the city, which was captured on the smartphone video, has sparked widespread public anger, including demands that the officer be fired and charged with murder.

Hundreds of people gathered at 5:00 p.m. at Rosa Parks Circle and then marched through downtown Grand Rapids past the Kent County Courthouse and other landmarks before they locked arms in front of the city police headquarters.

The multiracial crowd chanted Patrick Lyoya’s name, “No Justice! No Peace!” “Arrest the killer cop!” and “This is what democracy looks like!” as they marched in the cold and windy evening. Police barricades along the march prevented the demonstration from marching south on Ottawa toward Van Andel Arena, and there were several brief standoffs with officers in riot gear before the protesters moved on.

Demonstrations have been held each day since April 13, when the Grand Rapids Police Department (GRPD) released several videos of the police killing of Lyoya, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The officer pulled the young man over in a residential area of the city early in the morning of April 4 for a license plate violation.

Lyoya exited his vehicle to find out why he was being stopped while the officer demanded that he stay in his car. When Lyoya did not comply, the officer asked repeatedly, “Do you have a license?” While he looked confused and scared, the officer became aggressive and said, “Do you speak English?”

The young man then closed his car door and started to walk around the front of the vehicle when the officer grabbed him. Lyoya successfully broke free from the officer’s grip and began to run. The policeman tackled him, and a struggle ensued over the officer’s taser. Shortly, thereafter, the officer is seen on one of the videos placing his handgun against the back of Lyoya’s head, having pinned him to the ground, and pulling the trigger.

On Saturday evening, a prayer vigil of 100 people was also held in memory of Lyoya at the Epicenter of Worship church in Lansing. The service included 15 members of Lyoya’s family who stood together at the front of the church wearing shirts that read, “In loving memory.”

Peter and Dorcas Lyoya, Patrick’s parents, had previously spoken publicly about the murder of their son saying that they had left the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014 to escape violence, but they never expected to experience it in America. They said they were shocked that the person involved in using violence against their son was a police officer.

The family is demanding to see the man who killed Patrick, and they want him charged with murder. The Lyoyas have called for a demonstration and march to the State Capitol on Thursday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. in Lansing.

Local and state authorities have said the name of the officer will not be released unless charges are brought against him. The seven-year veteran of the GRPD has been place on administrative leave, according to GRPD Chief Eric Winstrom. Kent County prosecutors have said no decision will be made on potential charges against the unnamed officer until Michigan State Police complete an investigation.

Jeffrey A. Fagan, a leading expert on policing and crime from Columbia Law School, told MLive that a manslaughter charge is inevitable, and it should happen sooner rather than later. Fagan said, based on a review of the released videos, “At no point was the officer’s life in danger,” and “He shot as if the victim was armed and dangerous, which he wasn’t.”

However, far-right and law-and-order political considerations are involved in the aftermath of the killing of Lyoya. Republican candidate for Michigan governor Tudor Dixon, for example, said last Thursday, “We will not let this officer—or any officer—be sandbagged for reasonably protecting themselves by weak politicians who are afraid to say and do what is right.”

Over the past decade, Africans have become one of the fastest growing immigrant populations in the US through refugee admissions and the diversity visa lottery program, according to the Migration Policy Institute. There are 4.3 million black immigrants in the US, 95 percent of whom live in metropolitan areas.

A report in the USA Today said that over the past two fiscal years people from the Congo became the largest group of refugees to settle in Michigan, based on data from the US State Department. Chris Cavanaugh, director of Samaritas’ New American Resettlement program in West Michigan, said Grand Rapids is home to the largest Congolese refugee population in the state thanks to employment opportunities, as well as family and social connections like churches.

Cavanaugh told the USA Today, “Certainly the Congolese community is feeling some fear, kind of scared over what happened, and I would say rightfully so. Those maybe who have much less English skills are just more apprehensive about getting pulled over or how they’re supposed to respond in certain situations.”

As in the case of George Floyd, the death of Patrick Lyoya was exposed as an execution by a video captured on a smartphone by a bystander, triggering protests in the community and outrage over police violence across the country and internationally.

This latest brutal killing has been taken up by grandstanding Democratic Party officials and the pseudo-left, pointing out that Patrick Lyoya was black, and the officer was white. While it is true that more blacks are killed by police in the US as a proportion of the population, the exclusive emphasis on race ignores the full context as well as the statistics of police violence, which shows that there are twice as many white people killed by police each year than black.

Murder by police officers across the US is not, in the final analysis, a matter of race but of class. Meanwhile, during the two weeks since the killing of Patrick Lyoya, the protests by Grand Rapids residents have been multiracial and multi-ethnic. Working class people, regardless of skin color, view these events with disgust and are demanding that they be stopped immediately.

Police violence is one of the many indicators of the deepening social crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has killed millions of people worldwide and, as the imperialist fueled war with Russia in Ukraine intensifies, the ruling elites around the world are preparing for even bigger military conflicts including world war. The capitalist system is putting an ever smaller premium on human life, and the police, as the group of armed men and women that exists for the purpose of protecting the wealth of the capitalist class, are the enforcers of this class rule.",Q2

https://www.phillyvoice.com/new-york-city-brooklyn-subway-shooting-person-of-interest-frank-james-philadelphia/,Man who rented U-Haul in Philly is wanted gunman in Brooklyn subway shooting,"Update (12:15 p.m.): Frank James is the wanted gunman in connection with Tuesday morning's mass shooting on a New York City subway train, the New York City Police Department said Wednesday.

Authorities said that James, 62, fired a number of gun shots that seriously injured 10 people inside a subway car at a Brooklyn subway station. Investigators linked the gun allegedly used in the attack to James and an Ohio pawn shop, according to NBC News. A search for James' whereabouts is ongoing.

A man with connections to Philadelphia has been named a suspect in the investigation of the mass shooting on a New York City subway train, Mayor Eric Adams said Wednesday.

Frank James, 62, who has addresses in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, rented a U-Haul truck that is connected to the shooting, police said. He previously had been considered a person of interest.

Investigators found a credit card with James' name on it at the scene of Tuesday's shooting, which wounded at least 10 people, police said. They also found a key to the U-Haul James rented in Philly near the Brooklyn subway station where the train stopped.

A U-Haul van matching the description and Arizona license plate sought by police was found Tuesday afternoon parked near the scene of the attack.

The van has a Philadelphia address and the words ""Allegheny West"" written on one side, according to NBC10. U-Haul has a storage facility located at 2001 W. Hunting Park Ave. in the city's Allegheny West neighborhood.

Police said James had rented the vehicle sometime over the last several days, drove it from Philly to New York City and abandoned it close to the subway line where the shooting took place.

Investigators also were reviewing social media posts and YouTube videos that featured James making violent threats and going on tirades regarding race and Adams' policies.

A gunman wearing a gas mask and a construction vest set off a smoke grenade and fired at least 33 bullets in a subway car at around 8:30 a.m. Tuesday in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.

At least 10 people were shot, police said. Nearly 30 people were hospitalized due to gunshots wounds or smoke inhalation. Five people were in critical condition, but no injuries were considered life-threatening. No fatalities have been reported.

A .9-millimeter handgun, extended magazines, a hatchet, detonated and undetonated smoke canisters, a black garbage can, a rolling cart and gasoline also were found at the scene of the shooting, police said.

A magazine jammed in the gun, which authorities say possibly saved lives and prevented the weapon from continuing to fire.

Investigators said that the gunman's motive was unknown and that the attack was not being probed as terrorism.

The search for the gunman remains ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to contact New York City police at 800-577-8477. A $50,000 reward has been posted for information that leads to an arrest.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw tweeted Tuesday that the department was assisting the NYPD and FBI investigators in their search for the shooter.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jim-watkins-qanon-jan-6-committee-1363777/,QAnon Celebrity Jim Watkins Says He Met With the Jan. 6 Committee,"Jim Watkins, the 8chan/8kun operator and an influential figure among adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, met with the Jan. 6 committee on Monday.

Watkins posted about the meeting on his Telegram account. “The committee decided to do it by zoom. So I didn’t go to DC,” he wrote in response to followers questioning why he posted a picture of himself in Chicago rather than Washington, D.C. Watkins posted on Friday that he was scheduled to have “an appointment with Congress on Monday.”

A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee did not immediately respond to an inquiry about Watkins’ claim, nor did Watkins immediately respond to questions about the nature of the meeting.

Some researchers have pegged Watkins as the person behind the “Q drop” posts that inspired the QAnon conspiracy theory, which holds that the United States is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles whom former President Trump would — or, potentially, will — expose and imprison. Members of the QAnon cult were present during the attack on the Capitol last Jan. 6. The most notable among them was Jacob Chansley, also known as the “QAnon Shaman,” who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last fall for storming the building in horns and furs while toting an American flag. QAnon signage was also photographed outside the building.

Watkins’ ties to the cult stem from his ownership of 8kun (formerly 8chan), the far-right message board that has played host to QAnon since it moved off of 4chan. The Jan. 6 committee last August demanded records from 8kun — along with social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok — suspecting that Trump supporters may have used it to plot the Capitol attack.

The committee’s meeting with Watkins on Monday serves as a reminder that though it has already scheduled televised hearings, its work is not done.

The first of six public hearings will take place on Thursday. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) has teased that the committee’s findings will “blow the roof off the House.” He said on Monday that the committee has found evidence that Trump’s role in the events of last Jan. 6 extend beyond simply “inciting” the Capitol attack. Among Thursday’s scheduled witnesses is documentarian Nick Quested, who was embedded with the Proud Boys and its chairman Enrique Tarrio prior to Jan. 6.",Q2

Barr told the Jan. 6 Committee that he felt Trump’s election-fraud claims were ""bulls--t,"" and called specific allegations ""nonsense"" and ""crazy."" The testimony has been praised by the left, with some claiming he even made then-first daughter Ivanka Trump see the light that her father had truly lost.

This week, liberal pundits and network guests gave ample coverage to Barr’s testimony, touting him as a key witness in the Jan. 6 committee’s investigation into the 2021 Capitol riot.

The day after the much-hyped primetime airing of the committee hearing last week, MSNBC frequent contributor and lawyer Neal Katyal signaled that Barr’s testimony was devastating for Trump.

JAN. 6 COMMITTEE: THURSDAY'S HEARING TO FOCUS ON TRUMP'S PRESSURE ON PENCE TO OVERTURN ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES

""Most devastatingly, his own daughter [didn’t believe Trump’s claims] and said she agreed with Bill Barr, who called it bulls--t. And if Bill Barr knows about anything, he knows about bulls--t,"" Katyal said.

That same day, CNN analyst and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said he thought Barr’s testimony was ""very, very effective"" in ""puncturing the myth"" of Trump’s voter fraud claims.

Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig also weighed in on Barr’s testimony during an appearance on MSNBC’s Wednesday broadcast of ""Deadline: White House.""

[Barr’s] strength is – he knew in real time, sorry Donald, no chance,"" Leonnig said, as host Nicolle Wallace nodded along.

However, the media’s acceptance of Barr’s testimony was far removed from the condemnation Barr received in the past. Network hosts and their guests frequently insinuated Barr was a liar and a ""hack,"" contorting himself to fit the former president’s narrative on the Russia investigation and other issues. Some even asked for Barr to be arrested, or at the very least disbarred.

An analysis piece by liberal CNN reporter Stephen Collinson piece headlined, ""William Barr's stunning evolution from Trump loyalist to nemesis,"" depicted the ""ultraconservative"" Barr as forced into telling the truth.

""From villain to hero,"" Collinson wrote. ""Democrats once accused former Attorney General William Barr of lying to Congress and covering up Donald Trump's corruption. They said he was more interested in serving as the ex-President's attorney than the nation's independent top law officer separated from the White House by an invisible wall. But it is a mark of the extreme choices Trump forces upon those who served him that the ultraconservative career lawyer now finds himself on the same side as his liberal onetime accusers in defending America's democracy.""

The CNN column praised the man loathed by liberals for ""dismembering the ex-President's fantastical claims that he won the 2020 election.""

The mainstream media had a far different view of Barr only three years ago, regularly panning him for saying Trump’s campaign was spied on and for his memo declaring Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed to find any evidence of collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.

JAN. 6 COMMITTEE SCRUTINIZES CAPITOL TOUR LED BY REPUBLICAN REP. LOUDERMILK DAY BEFORE RIOT

In 2019, MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" namesake Joe Scarborough dismissed Barr as someone who would ""do anything for Donald Trump"" and called him a ""hack"" before suggesting he should be disbarred for launching the Durham probe into the origins of the Russia investigation.

""He’s already committed perjury before Congress,"" Scarborough said. ""I’m surprised somebody hasn’t moved to disbar him because he really should be disbarred.""

""Morning Joe"" regular Mike Barnicle once said Barr’s summary of the Mueller report ""seriously misleads people."" So many liberal pundits and Democratic lawmakers attacked Barr over his summary that Mueller himself had to defend Barr.

""We appreciate that the Attorney General made the report largely public, and I certainly do not question the Attorney General’s good faith in that decision,"" Mueller said in a rare press conference.

Barr was so loathed by the left in 2019 that Grabien Media founder Tom Elliott published a montage of media members calling for him to be thrown behind bars. CNN hosts Brianna Keilar, Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, and then-NBC reporter Kasie Hunt, who is now at CNN, all asked if Barr should go to jail for contempt because they wanted to see the full Mueller report.

Later that year, Scarborough said he believed Barr would be remembered as ""the most corrupt Attorney General in the history of the United States of America.""

MSNBC’s Joy Reid was not a fan of Barr in 2019 either, when she suggested he could have been connected to the death of Jeffrey Epstein because the facility where his body was found was under control of the Justice Department.

""This Department of Justice does not exactly inspire confidence, let’s just be blunt. William Barr’s Justice Department is not one that you can readily, simply rely upon and feel confident in, and so what do we make of all this now that in this federal facility, this person was allowed to be alone long enough to either harm himself or be killed? We don’t know what happened,"" Reid told viewers.

By 2020, Barr was criticized for condemning COVID-era stay-at-home orders and mask mandates as a ""threat"" to civil liberties.

""It seems to me that William Barr is searching so desperately to find a way to describe White Americans who refuse to wear masks as victims, that he’s reaching for comparisons that not only don’t make any sense, but reveal a kind of moral tone-deafness, that really reveals his character,"" Princeton professor Eddie Glaude Jr. said on MSNBC.

That same day, Scarborough joked that Barr was ""hoping to be able to draw large speaking fees in Russia in 2021.""",Q2

Republican candidates for governor pledge to get tougher on crime

Republican candidates for governor pledge to get tougher on crime

HARRISBURG (KDKA) - How to combat the loss of life in our cities is one of the most serious issues on the campaign trail.

It's one of the key questions that KDKA political editor Jon Delano asked when he interviewed eight Republican candidates for governor in next week's Republican primary.

Whether it's a big city or smaller town, ending the violence and the shootings are a top priority, candidates insist.

As a former city mayor, former U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta says he knows how to combat crime and back local police.

""Make sure they have the tools that they need and the funding that they need, and again the backing from their governor. I'll bring every resource I can to Pittsburgh, to Philadelphia, to any area in Pennsylvania where crime is overtaking our neighborhoods,"" says Barletta.

Former federal prosecutor Bill McSwain says restore respect for police.

""I would make sure the police are funded. They're supported. I would use my bully pulpit to make sure that I am contributing to the narrative that the police are heroes. They are not the villains,"" says McSwain.

Businessman Dave White wants the governor to appoint special prosecutors as district attorneys.

""That would give me the ability if a district attorney such as [DA Larry] Krasner in Philadelphia, who refuses to prosecute criminals, if he doesn't want to do it, I will make sure we do it,"" says White.

GOP candidates say they won't defund the police or associate with those who attack all police.

""We're seeing the ranks, especially in our cities, of men and women who want to be police officers shrinking. Why is that? Because the government and the policies and the rhetoric have not been supportive,"" says former U.S. Rep. Melissa Hart.

""Not only defending them, but promoting them, and honoring them, and respecting them because we've had a governor that walked next to a sign that said, 'Blue Lives Murder,'"" says public relations consultant Charlie Gerow.

One candidate blames Black Lives Matter.

""What I saw was a pattern all across our nation where cities experienced a Black Lives Matter protest, followed by looting, riots, arson and violence,"" claims Montgomery County Commissioner Joe Gale.

""When you stop holding people accountable, then their crimes are going to continue to grow,"" notes Pennsylvania Sen. Jake Corman.

But Dr. Nche Zama says it's not more police but better resources that will reduce crime.

""There are so many geniuses languishing and rotting in those neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. I want to be the governor that inspires them,"" says Zama.

One candidate, Pennsylvania Sen. Doug Mastriano, declined to participate, saying he did not have the time. The Democratic candidate, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, is unopposed in the primary.",Q2

https://www.dailydot.com/debug/us-eu-data-sharing-mass-surveillance/,Why the third time won’t be the charm for a new U.S.-EU data-sharing agreement,"A new data transfer agreement to facilitate companies safely and legally moving data across the Atlantic has been in the works for nearly two years.

Featured Video

During a week of NATO, G7, and European Council summits in Brussels last month, where Ukraine dominated the agenda, the U.S. and the E.U. revealed a new deal for underpinning digital trade between the two economies. Activists and privacy experts still have major concerns about how vigorous the agreement will be in guarding Europeans from U.S. mass surveillance.

The fact that President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made the announcement in a joint press conference alluded to the significance of the deal, even though, for now, it is only an agreement in principle.

The legal status of data transfers across the Atlantic has been tumultuous.

Safe Harbor, a framework first instituted in 2000, was struck down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2015 over its lack of protection for European data from mass surveillance by U.S. authorities. Its attempted successor Privacy Shield met the same fate in July 2020.

Since then, data transfers, which Facebook, Microsoft, and many tech giants rely on, existed in legal limbo as officials in the EU and U.S. scrambled to negotiate yet another agreement.

In the interim, companies rely on a series of alternative but complex mechanisms, called standard contractual clauses (SCCs), to keep data flowing. Agreements like this new one are pivotal as the EU only permits data to flow to countries and jurisdictions that have an equivalent level of data protection to Europe.

While it seems the discussions are beginning to bear fruit, for industry and privacy activists alike, the concern is still palpable about whether Europeans’ data will be free from U.S. scrutiny.

The tech industry was quick to welcome the latest agreement in principle. DigitalEurope, a lobby group for Meta, Amazon, Google, and more, said the agreement is necessary for preserving almost €1 trillion worth of EU-U.S. commerce every year.

Director general of DigitalEurope Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl said in a statement that the details will need to “deliver an agreement that stands the test of time.”

With its predecessors collapsing after legal challenges, building a framework for the long haul will be the ultimate test for this agreement to avoid EU-U.S. data flow falling into disarray again.

At the core of these challenges is surveillance and privacy, going back to the disclosures of Edward Snowden and the revelations of U.S. mass surveillance across the globe.

The European Court of Justice found that both Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield lacked robust mechanisms for ensuring that a European’s data transferred to a server in the U.S. would not be unlawfully caught up in a dragnet.

The court’s findings shined a light on the discrepancies between EU and U.S. privacy rights. Since then, the EU has only strengthened data protection, most notably with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which provide sweeping rules for safeguarding people’s data. The U.S. has no such law on a federal level.

Privacy activist Max Schrems led the legal challenge against both agreements.

After the Snowden revelations, Schrems first challenged Meta in the European courts over the legality of transferring data to the U.S. The case sought to uncover how a person’s data is treated when it leaves Europe and enters the U.S. The court found that Safe Harbor, the framework Meta was using, wasn’t up to snuff in protecting this data from unlawful surveillance. This ultimately led to the downfall of Safe Harbor and kickstarted this long-running saga.

The Austrian, who has dubbed the new deal “lipstick on a pig,” told the Daily Dot in an email that there remains a “fundamental clash” between the EU and U.S. when it comes to the surveillance question.

He said he expects that it too will collapse under the scrutiny of activists, lawyers, and ultimately the Courts of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

“Either we (if it is really bad) or someone else will probably bring it back to the CJEU again. This time just much faster than before,” he said.

Schrems is not alone in his assessment.

Estelle Masse, Europe legislative manager at Access Now, said the announcement by Biden and von der Leyen was a “disappointment” as there is still a lack of detail on the meat of the agreement that will “ensure that it is a durable deal and one that would resist a challenge in front of the court.”

Once again, surveillance is the problem.

Both the EU and the U.S. stated that there would be safeguards to ensure only “necessary and proportionate” access to data by U.S. intelligence authorities along with the establishment of a Data Protection Review Court for Europeans to take cases against the U.S. if they believe they have been subjected to unlawful surveillance.

Previous attempts to assuage European concerns included establishing an ombudsperson to field complaints, but the Trump administration took years to nominate a permanent official for this role.

This new court is a fresh attempt to provide Europeans with means for redress, but Masse raised concerns about how independent this court will be given that it will be established via executive order.

“It’s not actually a right to remedy, so it doesn’t satisfy the criteria that the [European] court has set, so a right to remedy in practice still does not exist,” Masse said. “There is no indication in none of the announcements that the U.S. would actually commit to stop bulk surveillance.”

The scope of U.S. surveillance that is still happening today remains a controversial issue.

The sentiments raised in Europe are echoed by Ashley Gorski, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.

“We’ve maintained that U.S. legislative reforms are essential to ensure an agreement that will survive judicial scrutiny by the [European] Court of Justice. The announcement was made even though there has not been any legislative reform,” Gorski told the Daily Dot.

The Data Protection Review Court will likely face a great deal of examination amid concerns about “satisfying EU legal requirements for independence.”

“The ACLU has proposed that the most straightforward way to deal with this disconnect that exists between EU and U.S. law is to have Congress make a couple of changes that would make it easier for individuals to bring surveillance challenges in Article III federal courts because those courts are already equipped to review these kinds of claims,” she added.

As all of these questions swirl, Masse said that it is most likely the agreement “will be sent in front of the court” much like its predecessors. If a remedy doesn’t meet the standards set by the EU, the framework could collapse a third time.

Article 19, another digital rights organization, told the Daily Dot that more needs to change on the U.S. side of things to truly make the agreement work—namely a federal data protection law akin to the EU’s GDPR.

“The lack of a U.S, data protection law is the real problem, and the collection of half-baked agreements, two of which have already been rejected by the [courts], that fail to provide any concrete rights or guarantee anything, doesn’t solve anything with regard to this matter,” a spokesperson said.

“In reality, unless the U.S. passes legislation curbing their intelligence gathering, it will be as flawed as the previous Privacy Shield.”

Despite these concerns flagged by activists, industries will be pushing hard to get this new data transfer deal over the line to end the legal questions that have hung over transatlantic data transfers for nearly two years.

Lisa Sotto, a cybersecurity and privacy lawyer, said that companies have struggled to navigate the legality of their data transfers since Privacy Shield was struck down. The alternative data transfer mechanism has been a headache to implement.

She said the agreement needs to be passed and implemented swiftly but conceded that legal challenges are inevitable.

“I expect Max Schrems to bring an action against whatever agreement is reached. I hope we will ultimately reach a sensible place. Not having this sort of mechanism in place for data transfers has been crippling to businesses.”

The ACLU’s Gorski added that the objectives are clear but the routes to get there are still muddled.

“This is really just about ensuring that people have the opportunity to seek meaningful redress when they’ve been subject to unlawful surveillance,” she said.

“Right now folks are eager to see what the actual text looks like. We have an agreement in principle, we have factsheets, but the text itself will matter. However, it is difficult to see how this agreement will survive judicial scrutiny in the EU in the absence of U.S. legislative reform.”

The new aid brings the total US economic support for Ukraine, the President said, to $1 billion in the past nearly two months since Russia’s invasion.

The $500 million in funding can be used by Ukraine’s government “to stabilize their economy, to support communities that have been devastated by the Russian onslaught, and pay the brave workers that continue to provide essential services to the people of Ukraine,” Biden said.

He also announced “Unite for Ukraine,” a new effort to support Ukrainians seeking to come to the US amid the ongoing, brutal invasion, with approximately two-thirds of Ukrainian children displaced.

Meanwhile, on the ground in Ukraine, evacuation efforts have become difficult.

Ukraine’s military release apparent Russian communications intercept with alleged order to kill Ukrainian POWs: Ukraine’s military intelligence on Wednesday released a purported communications intercept of Russian armed forces referring to an alleged order to kill Ukrainian prisoners of war in the city of Popasna in the eastern region of Luhansk, which is bearing the brunt of Russia’s renewed attack.

“The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine received an audio interception of the occupiers’ conversation, which refers to the order to kill all prisoners of war of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are in their captivity in the area of Popasna (Luhansk Region),” Ukrainian military intelligence tweeted on Wednesday.

“This is a blatant war crime, a violation of international law, and another striking example that the Russian military are murderers, rapists, and looters,” it added.

The alleged intercepted audio recording released Wednesday appears to feature the voices of unknown Russian soldiers saying: “What can I tell you, damn it, [expletive], for [unintelligible] — you keep the most senior among them, and let the rest go forever. Let them go forever, damn it, so that no one will ever see them again, including relatives.”

CNN cannot vouch for the authenticity of the recording and has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.

Evacuations from Azovstal plant not possible Thursday as there is no stable ceasefire: There is no possibility to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant on Thursday as there isn’t a stable ceasefire that will provide for safe evacuation, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said Thursday during an online briefing. The mayor appealed to international partners to facilitate a ceasefire and a corridor for evacuation. In addition, he noted that around 200 people are currently awaiting evacuation buses in Mariupol, but the buses have not arrived yet. Four evacuation buses with 80 civilians onboard left Mariupol on Wednesday and are currently heading to Zaporizhzhia, the mayor said. He also said that on Wednesday, during an attempt to evacuate civilian population, Russian troops began shelling.

More than 7.7 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to report: More than 7.7 million people are internally displaced in Ukraine after being forced to flee their homes due to Russia’s invasion, according to the latest International Organization for Migration report. According to the third Ukraine Internal Displacement Report, published Thursday, the number of internally displaced people in Ukraine has risen to at least 17.5% – or more than one in six – of Ukraine’s pre-war population. The latest survey, conducted between April 11 and April 17, found that at least 60% of those internally displaced are women. More than half of IDPs reported a lack of some food products. According to IOM, 28% of families with children under the age of five said they had faced difficulties in getting enough food for their children.

Another Russia-Ukraine prisoner exchange takes place, Ukrainian deputy prime minister says: Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Thursday that another exchange of prisoners had taken place between Ukraine and Russia.

However, the Sun-News confirmed that Amelia's last name is Baca.

LAS CRUCES - The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico called for an investigation into the Las Cruces Police Department after an officer shot and killed a woman in her 70s.

Amelia Baca, 75, was killed by an LCPD officer on April 16, according to multiple sources. While the department has not confirmed Baca's identity, multiple family members told the Sun-News that Baca was killed.

Family members said that Baca experienced a form of dementia, a general term for loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities that are severe enough to interfere with daily life.

""On arrival, an LCPD police officer encountered a female who was armed with at least one knife. The incident resulted in the officer firing at least one round at the female,"" a news release stated.

One family member told the Sun-News that Baca had knives next to her, not in her hand, when an officer shot her twice. The Sun-News has requested that LCPD release the officer's body camera footage from the shooting. The family also told the Sun-News they were in talks with a lawyer about future action.

The incident prompted the ACLU to call for an investigation into LCPD. In a news release, Senior Policy Strategist Barron Jones said LCPD has a crisis intervention team meant to prevent these types of incidents.

""If this team had been deployed to de-escalate the situation, (Baca) may still be alive today and receiving the help she needed,"" Jones said.

Jones linked the Las Cruces police killing to other police killings across the state. He said this situation demands ""comprehensive statewide use of force policy reform and increased oversight to ensure the public can rely on police following protective protocols already in place.

""Our communities will not be safe until police officers are held accountable to a clear and uniform standard,"" he said.

According to the Washington Post's database on police killings, 11 people have been killed by police in New Mexico in 2022. The same database reported that 27 people were killed in 2021.

New Mexico has the highest rate of deadly police shootings at 74 killings per million people, the database shows. The second highest is Alaska with 67 shootings per million people.

In a press release, the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) said personnel with the Fifth District responded to a reported stabbing in the 1500 block of Benning Road, Northeast, at approximately 2:52 a.m. Once on scene, authorities discovered the victim, later identified as Ladonia Boggs, 38, with an apparent stab wound. She was not displaying any signs of life and was conveyed to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, according to the release.

Personnel with the Capitol Area Regional Fugitive Task Force apprehended 44-year-old Carl Jones of Northeast D.C. on a Superior Court arrest warrant the same day, the MPD said. Jones is charged with second-degree murder while armed, and an investigation has found the incident to be domestic.

The MPD confirmed to People that Jones fathered Bogg’s infant, Kyon Jones.

The child went missing from the 1500 block of Benning Road on May 5, 2021, and his disappearance was reported two days later, the MPD said at the time.

Boggs allegedly told Jones that Child Protective Services (CPS) took the infant away, so Jones reached out to the National Center for Children and Families the following day, WRC reported. He learned that Kyon was not in CPS custody, and a social worker alerted the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency to the missing child and the mother’s history with the drug PCP, according to the outlet.

Boggs allegedly admitted to authorities that she rolled over onto the child while they were lying in bed while she was high on PCP and discarded the child’s body in a panic, WRC reported.

She also spoke with activist Henderson Long, who runs D.C.’s Missing Voice. The conversation was recorded on video and obtained by WRC.

“The last thing that I remember was that I had rolled over, and he was on my chest. After that, when I was ‘sleep, rolled over, noticed he was unresponsive — breathing — and I panicked,” she said, per WRC.

“He was ‘sleep on my chest and when I woke up, he wasn’t breathing anymore, because he was just that small. He was only 2 months old. He was a premature baby,” she added.

She said she walked around the block and returned home to dispose of the child.

“I came back in the house and got a blanket and his car seat, and wrapped it up and took it outside and just throwed it in the trash,” she said, per WRC.

According to court documents, surveillance video showed Boggs headed to a dumpster with a car seat, cardboard box, and plastic bag, WRC noted.

For days, authorities scoured a Virginia landfill for the child’s body, but their efforts were unsuccessful. The child’s remains have yet to be recovered, according to People.

CNN, KTUL, KJRH, KOKI

By Jason Hanna and Amanda Watts, CNN

The gunman who killed two doctors and two others at an Oklahoma medical building Wednesday did so after he blamed one of the physicians for causing him pain from a recent back surgery, a police chief said Thursday.

The shooter, Michael Louis, who police said killed himself after the rampage in Tulsa, had just earlier that afternoon legally purchased one of the firearms used in the slaughter, an AR-15 style rifle, city Police Chief Wendell Franklin said during a news conference.

Louis entered a physicians’ office building at Tulsa’s Saint Francis Hospital campus late Wednesday afternoon and shot dead his surgeon, Dr. Preston Phillips, and three other people before fatally shooting himself, said Franklin.

The other three victims at the Natalie Medical Building were Dr. Stephanie Husen, receptionist Amanda Glenn and patient William Love, authorities said.

Officers found a letter on Louis that “made it clear that he came in with the intent to kill Dr. Phillips and anyone who got in his way,” Franklin said.

“He blamed Dr. Phillips for the ongoing pain following the surgery,” Franklin said, later calling the letter’s contents “a clear motive.”

The others, Franklin said, just “stood in the way, and Louis gunned them down.”

An unspecified number of other people were injured in the shooting, which happened in orthopedic offices of the Warren Clinic on the building’s second floor, officials said at Thursday’s news conference.

These were the victims of the Tulsa shooting

The Warren Clinic is a series of primary and specialty care offices within the Saint Francis system.

The mass shooting is among the latest instances nationwide of first responders and civilians coming face-to-face with the threat of gun violence in public places. It comes more than two weeks after a racist assault at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a bloody attack at a church in California; and eight days after a heartbreaking massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

The Tulsa shooting is one of the 233 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. CNN and the archive define a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.

Shooter bought a gun earlier in the day

Louis, of Muskogee, a city roughly 45 miles southeast of Tulsa, had back surgery on May 19 performed by Phillips, and was released from a hospital May 24. He then called Phillips’ office several times over several days, complaining of pain and wanting additional treatment, according to Franklin.

Louis saw Phillips on Tuesday for treatment, and called Phillips’ office again on Wednesday before the shooting, “complaining of back pain and wanting additional assistance,” Franklin said.

Louis bought an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle from a gun store at 2 p.m. Wednesday, Franklin said. Louis also had bought a .40-caliber pistol from a pawn shop on Sunday, Franklin said.

The two firearms were found at the scene, Tulsa police Capt. Richard Meulenberg told CNN on Wednesday.

Police were initially alerted about the shooting in a 911 at 4:53 p.m. Wednesday. The call was made by someone off campus who’d been on a video chat with a doctor who was at the building, Franklin said.

“The doctor told her to call 911, saying there has been a shooting,” Franklin said.

Responding officers arrived at 4:56 p.m., Franklin said. Two minutes later, officers who’d reached the second floor heard a gunshot, the chief said.

“We believe that was the final gunshot, with the suspect taking his own life,” Franklin said.

At least one slain person was found in the same room as the gunman, as well as an uninjured female who was “hiding under a desk at the suspect’s foot,” Franklin said.

Administrator: Dr. Phillips was ‘the consummate gentleman’

Phillips was an orthopedic surgeon at the clinic, with an interest in spinal surgery and joint reconstruction, the hospital system said.

The notion that anyone would go after Phillips is “mind blowing,” said Dr. Cliff Robertson, president and CEO of Saint Francis Health System.

“Dr. Philips was the consummate gentleman,” Robertson said at Thursday’s news conference in Tulsa’s Heart Hospital at Saint Francis.

“He’s one of those folks that … his clinic cannot always be on time because he will spend every minute with patients that they need,” Robertson said. “It is the ultimate loss for Saint Francis and for Tulsa.”

He also paid homage to Husen, a doctor of osteopathy who worked in the clinic’s orthopedic department, and Glenn, the receptionist.

“The three best people in the entire world that are the most committed to doing what they do every day, and taking care of others, didn’t deserve to die this way,” Robertson said.

Saint Francis’ associate chief medical officer, Dr. Ryan Parker, expressed condolences to the family of Love, the slain patient. “To the family of Mr. Love, I’m so sorry we couldn’t save you,” Parker said through tears on Thursday. “When I woke this morning, I really just wanted this to all be a bad dream, but this is the reality of our world right now.”

Ruth Folly, a surgical technician at St. Francis Hospital, told CNN she’d gone on several medical missions with Phillips to Africa — and that Phillips had a positive impact on many lives.

Phillips traveled yearly with the nonprofit organization Light in the World Development Foundation, which was founded by Phillips’ colleague and Folly’s father, Dr. Komi Folly, said Ruth Folly. The group aims to provide surgical services to those in need.

Phillips was scheduled to go on another mission to Togo in mid-June, she said.

Glenn, a receptionist at the clinic, is survived by her two sons and husband, her friend Amy Pennington told CNN.

“She was a hard worker, kind soul and would do anything for you,” Pennington said.

Witnesses describe frantic first moments

Lachelle Nathan told CNN affiliate KTUL that she had arrived in her vehicle with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren for a doctor’s appointment when she saw multiple officers race toward the complex.

“It’s awful, it’s sad. My daughter-in-law is from Buffalo, so now it’s so close to home. It’s not even safe if you come outside anymore, you know?” Nathan said.

“I mean, you see it on TV,” her daughter-in-law said, “but you don’t think it’s actually going to happen right in front of your eyes, so this is a wakeup call for my kids, this can really happen anywhere and it’s very scary.”

“You can’t even go to a store, you can’t even go to school, now you can’t go to the doctor?”

Debra Proctor was in another building on the hospital campus for an appointment when she heard police sirens.

“Police were everywhere in the parking lot, up and down the surrounding blocks,” said Proctor, a registered nurse for more than four decades. “They were still arriving when I was leaving.”

Kalen Davis, a lifelong Tulsa resident, was waiting in traffic around 5 p.m. local time when she saw multiple police cars responding to the scene.

In a video she shared with CNN, authorities can be seen running toward a building with their guns drawn. Two officers are seen taking long guns out of their trunks as more emergency vehicles race to the scene.

“I just knew that it was a shooting situation because I saw police running with rifles,” Davis, 45, told CNN. “That’s when I got emotional.”

Three Bureau of Prisons employees at United States Penitentiary Thompson in Illinois have had to go to the hospital over the past two weeks, according to the local union president, prompting two members of Congress to write a letter to the agency questioning how mail for prisoners is processed.

""We write with concern about reports of unsafe conditions for correctional officers in opening mail for incarcerated persons,"" the letter written by Rep. Cherri Bustos, D-Ill., and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ili., and obtained by ABC News, said.

""We know that it is critical for incarcerated persons to have access to correspondence while serving their sentences. Unfortunately, mail is also one of the ways in which drug contraband can be brought into correctional facilities,"" the lawmakers wrote.

One staff member was hospitalized on Friday. The drug involved and the officer's condition are unknown.

On March 17, a corrections officer was sorting mail and 19 pieces of mail were soaked in amphetamines, according to USP Thompson Union President Jon Zumkehr.

The staff member started ""throwing up and having a violent reaction and was rushed to medical -- his vitals were off the chart,"" Zumkehr said.

A day later, another staff member was rushed to the hospital after being exposed to synthetic marijuana, he said.

In 2020, the Bureau of Prisons started a pilot program to convert mail to electronic scans at some facilities, to combat drug smuggling through official correspondence, according to the two lawmakers.

Zumkehr said the program was ended due to funding concerns.

""Staff shouldn't have a price tag on their life,"" he said.

Shane Fausey, president of the National Council of Prison Locals 33 told ABC News the substances officers are dealing with, including fentanyl, are both very dangerous and prevalent.

""It's a matter of safety. It's a matter of when you deal with substances like fentanyl, car fentanyl, they're so hazardous a minuscule amount is going to kill someone if we don't somehow stop it from entering our prisons,"" he said.

A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement to ABC News it would respond directly to members of Congress and their staff.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-why-cant-america-solve-its-gun-problem/article65469995.ece,Explained | Why can’t America solve its gun problem?,"The story so far: On May 24, a gunman went on a shooting rampage at Robb Elementary School in the small town of Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers. The attack has reminded the U.S. yet again that it has failed to act to stop gun crimes despite the grim toll on human life for several decades. The shooter, identified in reports as 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, carried out the massacre using AR-15 assault rifles, which he allegedly purchased legally from a gun store. The murders, which came scarcely 10 days after 10 people were shot dead at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, an incident identified as a racist hate crime, have prompted another round of acrimony between liberals and conservatives on the need for tighter gun control laws. U.S. President Joe Biden wasted no time in condemning the attack but was sketchy on details regarding what legislation or executive actions he hoped to push forward to close regulatory loopholes that allow teenagers to buy assault weapons, and, more broadly, a lack of background checks for potential gun buyers. Neither Mr. Biden, nor any of his Democratic predecessors have succeeded in getting common-sense gun control reform passed in the U.S. Congress owing to Republican lawmakers’ refusal to budge on their view regarding their constitutional right to bear arms.

How many school shootings have occurred in recent years?

The Uvalde school shooting is the worst such attack on U.S. soil since the incident at Sandy Hook elementary attack in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, in which 20 first-graders and six school employees were killed. A similar toll on human life came after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018, when a former student of the school in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 persons and wounded 17 others.

Overall, there have been at least 26 school shootings in 2022 alone and at least 118 incidents since 2018, according to reports that have tracked this statistic over the past four years. However, these include ‘non-mass shootings’ where fewer than four persons were killed in a single incident. Using this statistic, 2021 witnessed 34 shootings, the highest number during this period, followed by 24 incidents each in 2019 and 2018 and 10 shootings in 2020.

Considering mass school shootings alone, there have been 13 such attacks since 1966, including notably the Columbine High School massacre of 1999, at that time the worst mass shooting at a school in American history. It is concerning that the Columbine attack’s death toll now ranks fourth, after the three more recent shootings at Uvalde, Parkland and Newtown overtook the former on that grim statistic during the past decade.

What is the role of the Second Amendment?

The U.S.’s penchant for gun ownership stems from its deep belief in the Second Amendment of its constitution, which assures its citizenry that “a well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The Second Amendment, ratified in 1791, was one of 10 such that together make up the Bill of Rights in the U.S. constitution. The original intent of the founding fathers of the nation was to give to the people the right to defend themselves against an oppressive government and create an armed militia that could be recruited into federal military in the event of a war with a foreign power. However, after the balance of power shifted from the states to the federal government, including technological advances that made the U.S. military a far superior force than any local or state militia could hope to be, the only interpretation of the Second Amendment that remained was that it guaranteed, at the individual level, the right to bear arms.

Editorial | Unending tragedy: On U.S. school shootings and gun control debate

In 1939, the U.S. Supreme Court considered the matter in United States v. Miller and ruled that local, state, and federal legislative bodies possessed the authority to regulate firearms without implicating a constitutional right given that there was no individual right to bear arms, only a collective right of the citizenry. Using this ruling the state then regulated the inter-state commerce of sawed-off shotguns, which it deemed to not be consistent with any requirements of a “well-regulated militia.” That interpretation stood until 2008, in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, where the Supreme Court held that the “Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defence within the home,” effectively reading down a ban on handgun possession in Washington DC.

Regardless of the state of legal protections, a strong culture of gun ownership has permeated the broader consciousness of security-minded U.S. citizens since the times of the ‘Wild West’ or America frontier days. Today that culture is most fervently institutionalised in the Republican party, which has close links to the National Rifle Association, also a well-networked and deep pocketed organisation that systematically lobbies with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get specific laws passed favouring the possession and trade of firearms.

It is in this context that there are no surprises that Congress rejected no fewer than 17 attempts by the administration of former President Barack Obama to get common-sense gun control passed on the floor of the Senate. In the end Mr. Obama resorted to passing gun control reform by diktat, that is through the temporary route of executive actions. Exercising presidential power in this manner may be the only option available to Mr. Biden. These should, at a minimum, include an assault weapons ban, expanded background checks, and ban on gun ownership by those with mental illness, criminal records, or minors.",Q2
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/09/climate-crisis-lessons-to-learn-from-the-little-ice-age-cooling,Climate crisis: what lessons can we learn from the last great cooling-off period?,"In early February 1814, an elephant walked across the surface of the Thames near Blackfriars Bridge in London. The stunt was performed during the frost fair, when temperatures were so cold that for four days the top layers of the river froze solid. Londoners promptly held a festival, complete with what we might now call pop-up shops and a lot of unlicensed alcohol.

Nobody could have known it at the time, but this was the last of the Thames frost fairs. They had taken place every few decades, at wildly irregular intervals, for several centuries. One of the most celebrated fairs took place during the Great Frost of 1683-84 and saw the birth of Chipperfield’s Circus. But the river in central London has not frozen over since 1814.

The frost fairs are perhaps the most emblematic consequences of the “little ice age”, a period of chilly weather that lasted for several centuries. But while Londoners partied on the ice, other communities faced crop failures and other threats. The story of the little ice age is one of societies forced to adapt to changing conditions or perish.

It’s also a long-standing mystery. Why did the climate cool and why did it stay that way for centuries? Thanks to decades of studies, we are finally closing in on an explanation. The emerging story involves volcanoes, the oceans, possibly the sun and possibly also genocide.

A question of degree

Like most things in science, the little ice age was discovered slowly and piecemeal. “This all came about because there were lots of documentary records from around Europe, stating that there were some really cold winters,” says climatologist Paola Moffa-Sánchez of Durham University. These were reflected in records of grain prices, which rose because of crop failures and ships’ logs saying Greenland was surrounded by sea ice and unreachable.

The cooling was not continuous – it came in waves that reached different places at different times and magnitudes Dagomar Degroot, Georgetown University

The term “little ice age” was coined by a Dutch-born geologist named François Matthes, who in a 1939 report noted that glaciers in the Sierra Nevada in California had regrown at some point within the last few millennia. The term stuck, but it took decades to narrow down the timeframe.

This was done by British climatologist Hubert Lamb, who went on to found the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. In a study published in 1965, Lamb used European temperature records going back many centuries to identify a “notably warm climate… around AD1000–1200” that was “followed by a decline of temperature levels till between 1500 and 1700 the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred”. This chilly period was “undoubtedly upsetting for the human economies of those times (and perhaps of any time)” [his italics].

Since then, climatologists have tried to specify the duration and extent of the little ice age, but this has proved difficult. Most of the records showing the cooling are from Europe and records from elsewhere do not always show it.

“It’s not a global phenomenon, in that it wasn’t cool everywhere,” says Alexander Koch at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. In some places, such as China, the period was marked by a wetter but not cooler climate.

What’s more, “the cooling was not continuous”, says Dagomar Degroot of Georgetown University in Washington DC. “It came in waves… that reached different places at different times at different magnitudes.”

For this reason, the start and end of the little ice age are a little vague. “The classical definition is between 1400 and 1850,” says Moffa-Sánchez. However, “some people say 1300 to 1850”, pushing the start date back significantly. There is broad agreement that the period 1400-1800 is within the little ice age, she says, but outside that it’s fuzzy. Either way, the 1814 frost fair was near the end of the period.

Furthermore, the little ice age was not technically an ice age. These are periods in which Earth has permanent ice at both poles and we have been in one for more than 2.5m years. Within that period, the ice sheets have repeatedly waxed and waned. The most recent ice advance, which we colloquially call the ice age but is really a glacial period, occurred from about 115,000 to 11,700 years ago. Since then, we have been in a relatively warm period called the Holocene.

In that context, the little ice age is minor. “We’re talking about several 10ths of a degree C,” says Degroot. In contrast, the coldest portion of the last glacial period is thought to have been about 6C cooler than the past 4,000 years. Still, Degroot says, even this small change mattered. “On a regional or local scale, the anomalies could be really quite extreme,” he says, and documentary evidence shows that “at least some people were aware that they were living in an anomalous kind of climate”.

Mystery cooling

What was going on? The story isn’t entirely settled, but researchers are increasingly confident about the initial trigger: volcanoes.

“You have these eruptions that are happening in clusters,” says Degroot. A 2015 study used data from ice cores to identify 25 major eruptions from the past 2,500 years. Between 1200 and 1400, there were huge eruptions of the Samalas volcano in Indonesia, Quilotoa in Ecuador and El Chichón in Mexico.

Big eruptions blast sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere, the layer of the atmosphere above the weather. These aerosols reflect some of the sun’s rays back into space, cooling the Earth. In recent times, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippines triggered up to 0.5C of surface cooling.

Usually, an eruption only cools the climate for a few years. “But if you have big eruptions in clusters, that can set off positive feedbacks in the climate system,” says Degroot. For example, several years of cooler temperatures cause sea ice to expand. Sea ice is white, so compared with dark blue water it reflects more radiation back into space. “That can prolong and exacerbate the cooling,” he adds.

There can also be knock-on effects in the ocean, says Moffa-Sánchez. If the winds change, huge rafts of sea ice can be carried south from Greenland into the Labrador Sea. There, they interfere with the huge Atlantic currents that carry warm water from the tropics towards Europe.

This is a complex story, in which the slight initial cooling from the volcanoes triggers changes in the Earth system that lead to more and lasting cooling. But it seems to hold true. A 2018 modelling study found that it was not possible to explain the little ice age without invoking volcanic eruptions, although that did not mean other factors were not also at work.

A fading star

Another possible factor is the sun. The amount of energy it pumps out varies ever so slightly, most famously over the 11-year solar cycle during which activity varies from a maximum to a minimum and back again. The effects on Earth are so small they’re hard to detect, but the sun sometimes has more of an impact.

Several times in the past 1,000 years, our star has entered a “grand minimum”, in which it spends several decades being less active. The most recent was the Dalton Minimum between 1790 and 1820. This was preceded by the Maunder Minimum of 1645-1715. Before that, there is thought to have been the Spörer Minimum between about 1460 and 1550 and the Wolf Minimum around 1280-1350. Such grand minima can cool the planet, though by no more than 0.3C and probably less.

Grand minima probably played a role in some of the chilliest episodes, says Moffa-Sánchez. In her studies of the period, “cold centuries coincided with these really famous solar minima.” She has found evidence that grand minima affect wind patterns, with knock-on effects for ocean currents and heat distribution.

However, it seems unlikely that grand minima alone caused the little ice age. The timings don’t fit and, in any case, the climate impacts of grand minima are much smaller than those of massive eruptions.

The suggestion is that this cold spell was caused by humanity – in a truly horrible way

It may be that a solar maximum in the late 1300s also played a role. A study published in December 2021 found that this shifted wind patterns, interfering with the crucial Atlantic warm water current.

The key point is – this isn’t an either-or debate, says Moffa-Sánchez. “It’s a likely combination of all of them.”

Numerous causes helps explain why the climate shifts came in waves, rather than there being one abrupt change to a lasting cooler state. “It was not that you had this little ice age period where it was always cold,” says Moffa-Sánchez. “You just had several cold centuries throughout this four-century-long period.”

However, one big puzzle remains. The coldest period of the little ice age was around 1610 and it doesn’t coincide with a grand minimum. Nor was there a particularly big eruption: Peru’s Huaynaputina went off in 1600, but while the blast was large it wasn’t exceptional.

Instead, the suggestion is that this cold spell was caused by humanity – in a truly horrible way.

The great dying

In 1492, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas. Over the following decades, Europeans began colonising them. In the process, they fought with Indigenous Americans, often killing them. But even more lethally, they brought diseases. One of the worst was smallpox, which killed millions.

As well as being a genocide and a tragedy, this may have had an impact on the climate. Many Indigenous Americans were farmers who had cleared forests for their crops and when they died the trees grew back, drawing carbon dioxide out of the air and cooling the planet. This scenario was first outlined by climatologist William Ruddiman in 2003, as part of his “early Anthropocene” hypothesis that humans have been affecting Earth’s climate for millennia, albeit less than we are today.

The idea that mass deaths among Indigenous Americans led to climate cooling has received tentative support from modelling studies. Still, it has been controversial because there are so many uncertainties about the key numbers.

However, in 2019 Koch and his colleagues published an updated analysis. They went through the argument step by step and tried to quantify everything, from the number of people who died to the extent of reforestation. They concluded that the European arrival led to 56m deaths by 1600. This dreadful toll meant trees grew again on 56m hectares of land, removing 27.4bn bn kilograms of carbon dioxide from the air.

“It’s a really interesting theory,” says Degroot. However, he remains sceptical because we don’t know how land use was changing in other parts of the world, especially Africa.

Resilience

While the question of whether human society contributed to the little ice agee remains up for discussion, what’s clear is that the little ice age affected human society.

For example, Norse settlers made their home in Greenland in 985 and stayed for centuries, only abandoning it in the early 1400s. It has often been suggested that the little ice age played a role in that. However, a study published in March looked at sediments from the region and found no sign of cooling, but it did find a drying trend, which would have meant less grass to feed livestock.

Such stories may be true, but it’s crucial to remember that people were not passive victims, says Degroot. “You don’t just see people who are completely at the whim of changing climatic conditions, you see people changing adaptively.”

Degroot points to the Arctic, where there was often remarkable activity despite the increase in sea ice. Between 1611 and 1619, European whalers operated off the shores of Svalbard, because there was a shortage of vegetable oil and whale oil was a substitute.

For the Dutch Republic, the period between 1560 and 1720 was something of a golden age, despite or even because of the cold winters. It did not depend on home-grown agriculture, so local crop failures were less of a problem, says Degroot. Instead, the republic’s economy was driven by merchant ships, whose operators devised ingenious ways to cope with the cold – and the Dutch thrived while their neighbours struggled.

“It so rarely is what you’d expect,” says Degroot. Studying how past societies responded to climatic shifts such as the little ice age will help us all, as the climate crisis becomes ever more intense. “Hopefully, we can learn from them, figure out what they did right, what they did wrong.”

We had better learn fast, because the little ice age was just a taster. Back then, the average global temperature cooled by a fraction of a degree, but we’ve already warmed it by 1.1C, and are set to blow past 1.5C in the next few decades.",Q2

How much can a landlord charge me for my background check? Can I provide my own background check to a landlord? How much can my late fee be?

There are more and more laws being made in New York State by the Attorney General in order to make things clear for both the landlord and the tenants that are renting from them.

There is a new law that went into effect in 2022. No landlord can 'blacklist' potential tenants anymore. What does 'blacklisting' mean if you are a landlord? You cannot deny a tenant an apartment or space because of a previous legal situation with a different landlord. For example: A landlord cannot pass on a potential tenant because that tenant sued one of the last landlords for any reason. If the landlord cannot give a justifiable reason for why they denied you, they may get fined by New York State.

Here are some important things to note to make sure you're landlord, or future landlord is not doing:

A rent payment can only be considered late if it is received more than five days after it is due.

The most your landlord can charge as a late fee is $50 or 5% of your monthly rent, whichever is less.

Before signing a lease, the most a landlord can charge is $20 for a credit and background check.

The landlord has to give you a copy of the background/credit check, as well as an invoice from the company that performed it. Otherwise, they can’t charge you for it.

You can provide your own background and credit check to avoid any fees, as long as the background/credit check was done in the past 30 days.

The Reason For The Dryer Sheets

Every year we see a countless number of bugs come out during the warmer months of the year. If you live in Iowa you know you're gonna be dealing with these annoying guys for a while since summer is still going strong.

Some bugs are more mean than annoying though. Wasps and yellowjackets are some of the worst bugs out there in the Midwest, heck there are even ""Killer ones!"" One place that wasps and yellowjackets like to hide out in is your mailbox.

Mail carriers already work hard, and running into a wasp or yellowjacket just makes a day worse. So if there are some mean bugs hanging out by your mailbox there's a good chance that your mail carrier will put a dryer sheet in your box. To avoid having these insects build their nests in your mailbox, mail carriers will sometimes place scented dryer sheets in there. Apparently, wasps and yellowjackets hate them, seeing as though they strongly dislike strong aromas.

According to a mail carrier user on Reddit this trick should last as long as the smell does. It should keep wasps and yellowjackets away from your mailbox. In fact, dryer sheets are known for keeping a large number of different bugs away.

Dryer Sheets Can Do More

https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220401-famed-french-fashion-photographer-patrick-demarchelier-dies-1,Famed French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier dies,"The self-taught French photographer, who died on Thursday, had his first Vogue cover in 1977 and one of its most iconic, featuring Madonna, in 1989.

But it was when he was appointed as Princess Diana's personal photographer later that year -- the first time a non-Brit had become an official snapper to the royal family -- that he became a major name.

His shot of Diana beaming into the camera while hugging her knees and wearing a white strapless dress and a tiara -- or another of her smiling in a black turtleneck -- became central to her image as ""The People's Princess"".

Demarchelier had a long collaboration with Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, and shot all the biggest names during the 1990s heyday of the supermodels from Cindy Crawford to Naomi Campbell, and Kate Moss to Christy Turlington.

He also photographed movie stars and celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro, Anthony Hopkins and Oprah Winfrey.

""Thanks for so many great memories and beautiful, timeless images,"" Crawford wrote on Instagram alongside a moody, black-and-white mountain shot of her.

No cause of death was given by Demarchelier's family, who announced his passing on his official Instagram page accompanied by three photos.

By the 2000s, Demarchelier was famous enough to be name-checked in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" starring Meryl Streep, and for a cameo in the ""Sex and the City"" movie.

He was honoured by the French state with the Order of Arts and Letters in 2007, and had a retrospective of his work at the Petit Palais museum in Paris in 2009.

Allegations and denial

But in 2018, Demarchelier became one of the most high-profile targets of the #MeToo movement when The Boston Globe published an expose in which seven women including a former assistant accused him of sexual misconduct.

Among many accusations of abuse, the newspaper reported that one of his photo assistants had written to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour about ""relentless advances by Demarchelier beginning when she was a 19-year-old intern"".

She ""urged Wintour to prevent Demarchelier from having access to other young women.""

Demarchelier denied the accusations, describing them as ""impossible"" and ""pure lying"", but publisher Conde Nast stopped working with him.

Many others had happier memories.

""I am grateful to have been lucky enough to be in front of your lens,"" model Gigi Hadid wrote on Instagram following his death. ""Most gentle, most legendary, soft but full of life.""

Model Emily Ratajkowski, who has been outspoken about sexual harassment in the industry, had positive experiences with Demarchelier.

She posted several nude shots that he had taken of her, with the caption: ""So honored to have worked with the legend and the most lovely @patrickdemarchelier you will be missed.""

Demarchelier was born in the northern French town of Le Havre on August 21, 1943, and was given his first camera by his step-father for his 17th birthday.

He began working as a fashion photographer in the 1960s in Paris before following a girlfriend to New York in 1975.

He produced campaigns for many major brands including Chanel, Donna Karan, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and many more.

He is survived by his wife, three sons and three grandchildren.

https://smartwatermagazine.com/news/global-water-resources/global-water-resources-buys-farmers-water-company,Global Water Resources buys Farmers Water Company,"Global Water Resources, a pure-play water resource management company, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Farmers Water Co., a subsidiary of Farmers Investment Co. (FICO), located in Pima County, Arizona.

The acquisition, if completed, would add approximately 3,300 active water service connections and an approximate 21.5 square miles of Certificate of Convenience and Necessity service area in Sahuarita and surrounding unincorporated Pima County.

The primarily residential connections are in close proximity to the service areas of Global Water’s recently acquired Las Quintas Serenas, Francesca, Mirabell, and Red Rock water companies. All of these areas fall within the Arizona Sun Corridor, a megaregion that is expected to double in population by 2040. Global Water plans to retain all Farmers Water employees and maintain a local customer service center.

“Global Water will work closely with FICO and the community to bring this utility into our family of companies and address its future infrastructure and water service requirements for supporting growth and economic development,” stated the company’s president and CEO, Ron Fleming. “Together, with the implementation of our industry-leading approach to utility consolidation, automation and water resource management, we plan to advance Farmers’ long-standing record of providing safe, high-quality water services to the community.”

Upon closing, Farmers Water will represent Global Water’s seventh acquisition in Pima County and its second in the Town of Sahuarita, including the adjacent Las Quintas Serenas water utility it acquired in November 2021. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.

FICO president and CEO, Dick Walden, commented: “After considerable research and due diligence, we have determined that Global Water Resources has the financial, managerial, and technical expertise needed to properly serve the customers we have also come to know as our neighbors. Global Water Resources also brings the added benefit of having a significant and growing presence in our region. We believe this is vital to ensuring they are a good community partner, which they have demonstrated in other areas that they serve.”

Global Water plans to implement its industry leading technology platform which would include upgrading Farmers Water’s connections from manually-read meters to smart meters, a technology it has successfully deployed several times including in its largest service area. Smart meters support greater operational efficiencies as well as real-time information for customers about their water usage, including leak and high usage alerts. This information can help preserve scarce water resources while lowering monthly water bills.

“We believe our long history of effective utility management and our broad regional footprint will add value to Farmers and the community it serves,” noted Chris Krygier, Global Water’s chief strategy officer. “We will apply our core expertise to meet the collective needs of the community, as we implement our regional infrastructure planning and complete all needed operational improvements.”

The value of Global Water’s approach and recognition of the company’s performance as a utility owner has resulted in numerous awards, including national recognition as a ‘Utility of the Future Today’ for its superior water reuse approach by a national consortium of water and conservation organizations led by the Water Environment Federation (WEF).",Q2

https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/in-a-first-u-s-navy-shoots-down-cruise-missile-with-a-laser-system,"In a First, U.S. Navy Shoots Down Cruise Missile With a Laser System","The U.S. Navy reports that it has shot down a simulated cruise missile using an all-electric laser weapon for the first time ever.

The Navy has used a laser to shoot down a missile before - but long ago, and with a much different technology. During the MIRACL chemical-laser research program in the 1980s-90s, the Navy's deuterium fluoride laser system shot down high-speed aerial targets in multiple test runs. Though extremely powerful, MIRACL was ultimately abandoned due to the challenges of handling its toxic fuel in the field.

A solid-state, all-electric laser is an entirely different weapons system, and the Navy has been working on increasingly-powerful solid state lasers for many years. The system tested in February was the Layered Laser Defense (LLD), designed and built by Lockheed Martin. It is another demonstrator for technology to counter drones and fast-attack boats, like the earlier LaWS system. It can also use its high-resolution telescope to track airborne threats and conduct battle damage assessment after engaging a target.

The drone shoot-down was part of a recent Navy test at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. During the recent test at White Sands, the LLD tracked or shot down multiple targets, including unmanned fixed-wing drones, quadcopters and high-speed drones that simulate subsonic cruise missiles.

The Navy is developing laser weapons because of their precision, speed and ""bottomless"" magazine, without the hazard of keeping propellants and explosives on board. Modern high-power lasers run on the ship's electrical service, making them inherently safer than traditional guns and cannons. They can keep running for as long as a ship has power, and the main ""cost per round"" is the cost of the fuel to run the generators.

“Innovative laser systems like the LLD have the potential to redefine the future of naval combat operations,” said Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Lorin C. Selby. “They present transformational capabilities to the fleet, address diverse threats, and provide precision engagements.""

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has been working on this capability for many years. In 2014, ONR tested the Laser Weapon System (LaWS) aboard the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf. More recently, ONR fielded the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD) aboard the USS Portland in 2021.

The Navy says that there is no plan to field the LLD, but it provides some insight into the future of laser weapons. It is compact, powerful, and more efficient than previous systems, and the Navy says that it incorporates artificial intelligence to improve tracking and targeting.

“LLD is an example of what a very advanced laser system can do to defeat significant threats to naval forces,” said David Kiel, a former Navy captain who is a program officer in ONR’s Aviation, Force Projection and Integrated Defense Department, which managed the testing. “And we have ongoing efforts, both at ONR and in other Navy programs, to keep building on these results in the near future.”",Q2
https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/world/texas-school-shooting-police-say-gunman-walked-through-unlocked-door/,Texas gunman walked through unlocked door at school - police,"The 18-year-old gunman who killed 21 people at a Texas elementary school walked in unimpeded through an apparently unlocked door, a law enforcement official said Thursday.

The gunman, Salvador Ramos, was also apparently inside the building for at least three-quarters of an hour before Border Patrol agents stormed a classroom and killed him, according to the timeline given by Victor Escalon, a regional director at the Texas Department of Public Safety.

The school normally has an armed school safety officer. But when Ramos arrived on Tuesday, ""there was not an officer, readily available, armed"", and the gunman entered the building ""unobstructed"", Escalon said.

Law enforcement authorities faced mounting questions and anger over the amount of time that elapsed before they stormed the place and put a stop to the rampage at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde that left 19 children and two teachers dead.

Many other details of the case and the police response remained murky. The motive for the massacre — the nation's deadliest school shooting since Newtown, Connecticut, a decade ago — remained under investigation, with authorities saying Ramos had no known criminal or mental health history.

During the siege, which ended when a US Border Patrol team burst in and shot the gunman to death, frustrated onlookers urged police officers to charge into the school, according to witnesses.

""Go in there! Go in there!"" women shouted at the officers soon after the attack began, said Juan Carranza, 24, who watched the scene from outside a house across the street.

Carranza said the officers should have entered the school sooner: ""There were more of them. There was just one of him.""

Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw said Wednesday that 40 minutes to an hour elapsed from when Ramos opened fire on the school security officer to when the tactical team shot him.

""The bottom line is law enforcement was there,"" McCraw said. ""They did engage immediately. They did contain [Ramos] in the classroom.""

But a department spokesman said Thursday that authorities were still working to clarify the timeline of the attack, uncertain whether that period of 40 minutes to an hour began when the gunman reached the school, or earlier, when he shot his grandmother at home.

""Right now we do not have an accurate or confident timeline to provide to say the gunman was in the school for this period,"" Lt. Christopher Olivarez told CNN.

Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz did not give a timeline but said repeatedly that the tactical officers from his agency who arrived at the school did not hesitate. He said they moved rapidly to enter the building, lining up in a ""stack"" behind an agent holding up a shield.

""What we wanted to make sure is to act quickly, act swiftly, and that's exactly what those agents did.""

But a law enforcement official said that once in the building, the Border Patrol agents had trouble breaching the classroom door and had to get a staff member to open the room with a key. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk publicly about the investigation.

Olivarez said investigators were trying to establish whether the classroom was, in fact, locked or barricaded in some way.

Javier Cazares, whose fourth grade daughter, Jacklyn Cazares, was killed in the attack, said he raced to the school as the massacre unfolded. When he arrived, he saw two officers outside the school and about five others escorting students out of the building. But 15 or 20 minutes passed before the arrival of officers with shields, equipped to confront the gunman, he said.

As more parents flocked to the school, he and others pressed police to act, Cazares said. He heard about four gunshots before he and the others were ordered back to a parking lot.

""A lot of us were arguing with the police, 'You all need to go in there. You all need to do your jobs.' Their response was, 'We can't do our jobs because you guys are interfering,'"" Cazares said.

Ramos crashed his truck into a ditch outside the school, grabbed his AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle and shot at two people outside a funeral home, who ran away uninjured, according to authorities and witnesses.

As for the armed school officer, he was driving nearby but was not on campus when Ramos crashed his truck, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorised to discuss the case and spoke of condition of anonymity.

Investigators have concluded that school officer was not positioned between the school and Ramos, leaving him unable to confront the shooter before he entered the building, the law enforcement official said.

https://www.independentsentinel.com/mask-travel-mandate-struck-down-wh-will-no-longer-require-it-federal-overreach/,Mask Travel Mandate Struck Down – WH Will No Longer Require It – FEDERAL OVERREACH!,"A US federal judge on Monday struck down the COVID-19 mask mandate for public transportation imposed by the administration of President Joe Biden.

Mask mandates have stopped in every other aspect of daily life and it is time we stop mandating. Individuals need to make their own decisions.

US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle of the Middle District of Florida said the mask mandate exceeds the statutory authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

IT WAS FEDERAL OVERREACH

The mandate requiring face masks on airplanes, the subway, trains, buses, taxis, and other forms of public transportation. The CDC recently extended it until May 3. There is a rise in coronavirus cases.

The CDC is violating constitutional rights. European airlines no longer require masks.

Mizelle, a nominee of former Republican President Donald Trump, issued her ruling in a lawsuit filed in July 2021. The filling represented a conservative non-profit organization called the Health Freedom Defense Fund and two individual plaintiffs.

Although the public has a “strong interest” in combating the spread of COVID, the judge said, the mask mandate “exceeded the CDC’s statutory authority,” and it “failed to adequately explain its decisions.”

Meanwhile, in Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau still does not allow the unvaccinated to fly.

“Because our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends, the Court declares unlawful and vacates the Mask Mandate,” Mizelle said in a 59-page ruling.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/politics/biden-democracy-asia-trip-what-matters/,Analysis: President Joe Biden finds unity abroad. He’s losing it at home,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

CNN —

President Joe Biden’s crusade against authoritarian leaders abroad is complicated, constantly, by the messiness of his democracy at home.

The leader who so forcefully condemns aggressors and so completely marshals the world community against Russia notoriously failed to marshal the senators he needed to enact a lasting domestic agenda.

He’s bent on ensuring that the Ukrainian and Taiwanese people can choose their own leaders in free elections, but a shocking number of Republicans continue to reject his own election victory.

He sputters trying to explain a teetering economy to Americans, which could cost his party control of Congress in elections later this year.

The Senate is so paralyzed by the filibuster, which gives a minority the ability to squash legislation, that no elected leaders seem to be seriously talking about federal legislation to deal with some of the largest American problems:

An expected wave of migrants at the border.

A climate crisis that threatens the health of the planet.

The epidemic of gun violence that strikes with increasing frequency – on the subway, at the supermarket, in the salon.

To name a few.

American democracy is not uniform. The Supreme Court seems poised to remove the right of American women to obtain an abortion within limits. Some states, exercising their own form of democracy, are looking forward to outlawing women ending any unwanted pregnancy, even shortly after conception. Oklahoma legislators recently passed a bill that would ban abortion “from conception.”

Who should Biden root for in this election? A key test of faith in US democracy comes on Tuesday in Georgia when the Republican governor and secretary of state who stood up to former President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election results face Republican primary voters.

Both Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger want to keep their jobs. For the governor’s race, Trump has endorsed former US Sen. David Perdue, but Kemp appears to have momentum, drawing the former President’s ire. Election deniers, as Politico points out, have so far failed to win primaries for secretary of state positions in Idaho and Nebraska.

The cruel irony of these primaries. The difficulty for someone like Biden is that he might prefer the Republicans who acknowledge the legitimacy of his presidency to triumph in their primaries. It arguably sends a signal of unity, however small, in a shared truth. But it may also hurt his party’s prospects in November to have Republican candidates who can appeal to voters who do not reject him outright.

Abroad, Biden speaks clearly and with power. White House aides were caught off guard and immediately sought to clarify Biden’s unequivocal promise to Taiwan on Monday.

“Yes,” he said, the US would get involved militarily if China invades Taiwan just as Russia has invaded Ukraine.

“That’s the commitment we made,” Biden said during a news conference in Tokyo, standing alongside the Japanese prime minister. It’s a step farther than the US has gone in helping Ukraine, which is not part of the strategic North Atlantic Treaty Organization, known as NATO.

Biden has repeated this promise multiple times in recent months, which suggests he’s speaking his mind, and the aides – who reiterated US respect for mainland China’s government – are trying to equivocate.

International relations can be hard to follow. The US appeases China by not having official diplomatic relations with the self-governing island of Taiwan, and China blocks Taiwan from being an official member of international alliances. But the US has supported Taiwan as a democracy and pledged in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide arms to help it defend itself.

A message from Biden to China. China would face American firepower – Biden did not elaborate on how – if it invaded Taiwan.

Standing up to authoritarian aggressors for democracies is turning into the main theme of Biden’s presidency. He wants to show the world that the US form of government is better than the authoritarian version, where presidents change the rules to give themselves power for decades or for life and where they plot to seize land.

Remaking America as the leader of democracies. Biden’s greatest success as President has been to marshal most of the world against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

But at home, he faces an arduous task. The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman emerged from a recent lunch with Biden with a heavy heart.

“Biden didn’t say it in so many words, but he didn’t have to,” Friedman wrote. “I could hear it between the lines: He’s worried that while he has reunited the West, he may not be able to reunite America.”

Democracy works both ways. Friedman’s larger point was that it’s anyone’s guess if the next US president will be such a strong backer of democracy.

The evidence suggests Biden’s chance to reunite America – if that opportunity ever actually existed and if America was ever actually united – may have already passed. The same democracy that gave him power could soon take some away.",Q2

The SHO was alone in his car when the attackers began chasing him.

According to Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Ijaz Khan, the assailants were not motorcyclists but came in a white car, got out of the vehicle with Kalashnikovs and 9mm pistols and attacked the SHO's vehicle.

SHO Shakeel was killed on the spot, more than ten Zeiss bullets were fired at the vehicle whose shells were found in the attack.

On Tuesday, another similar major attack took place in Peshawar Sarki Gate in the inner city area within the limits of Yakatoot police station where an inspector of Intelligence Bureau (IB) was killed and two other IB personnel were injured.

Unidentified gunmen opened fire on the vehicle of the intelligence personnel near the gate of the police station. The assistant sub-inspector along with his brother were critically injured and rushed to the hospital.

After collecting CCTV footage, empty shells and other evidence from the location, a case was registered against unidentified assailants at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station.

According to police, Inspector Najeeb, Assistant Sub-Inspector Amanullah, his brother Junaid Khan and his other sister-in-law were present in the vehicle when the unidentified gunmen opened indiscriminate fire on them from inside their vehicle.

Amanullah and Junaid were critically injured and were rushed to the hospital in critical condition where Inspector Najeeb succumbed to his injuries. The other inspectors are currently under treatment and their condition is reported to be out of danger.

The accused managed to escape from the scene after committing the crime.

After the incident, a large contingent of local police, Counter-Terrorism Department Police and intelligence personnel reached the spot and cordoned off the area and launched a search-and-rescue operation.

No arrests have been made so far, according to police.

Attacks on Sikh community

At least 48 hours before this incident, two shopkeepers from the Sikh community in Sarband area, on the outskirts of Peshawar, were shot dead by terrorists on motorcycles in Battatil Bazaar.

The shopkeepers belonged to Mohalla Jogan Shah area of ​​Peshawar.

After the incident, the Sikh community of Peshawar staged a protest rally from Dabgri Gurdwara. Many Sikhs participated in the protest and closed Hashtnagri Road in Peshawar for three hours, and called on the government to provide security to the Sikhs and take steps to prevent targeted killings.

Sikh community leader Dr Sahib Singh while talking to The Express Tribune said that the incident that took place in Battatil Bazaar was very tragic and that both the victims were from poor families.

Dr Sahib Singh further added that a few months ago, gold medalist Dr Satnam Singh was also targeted in Peshawar. However, his family did not receive any monetary package.

On September 30 last year, unidentified assailants shot dead Dr Satnam Singh a hakim (physician) belonging to the Sikh community on Charsadda road.

According to the police, the attackers barged into the clinic of Satnam Singh and shot at him four times. He was rushed to the provincial capital's Lady Reading Hospital in an injured condition where he later succumbed to his injuries.

Baba Gurpal, a Sikh social leader in Peshawar, told The Express Tribune that for the past 20 years, Satnam Singh's clinic had been located on Charsadda Road, which was one of the few famous and able sages of the Sikh community.

“We were shocked by this incident. We hope the accused will be arrested soon. Police are cooperating a lot,” Baba Gurpal stated.

Chandler Yerves dreamed of working at the acclaimed New York City restaurant - which is located on Madison Avenue, in between 24th and 25th street in Manhattan, was once named the best restaurant in the world, and has had many celebrity guests including Leonardo DiCaprio and Martha Stewart - since he was a child.

The chef was hired as a junior prep cook at the upscale restaurant, known as EMP for short, in May 2021 - around the same time that it reopened and announced it was switching to an all-vegan menu after spending 15 months closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, soon after he got the job, Yerves realized it wasn't exactly what he thought it would be - claiming that he worked long hours on very little sleep and was screamed at for things like making too much noise while getting ice from the freezer in its infamous 'silent kitchen.'

Yerves explained to Insider that he had to wake up at 4AM and would work more than 20 hours a day six days a week, often not getting to bed until midnight, and standing for hours on end - despite having a broken ankle at the time.

Chandler Yerves (pictured center with his girlfriend) was hired as a junior prep cook at the upscale New York City eatery in May 2021

His new job began around the same time that owner and head chef, Daniel Humm (pictured), 46, announced the acclaimed restaurant was switching to an all-vegan menu

He said he was told he wouldn't be allowed to wear his medical boot in the kitchen, since it left his toes open.

At one point, Yerves claimed that a sous-chef made him search all around the city for peppers that were exactly five inches long, which meant he had to go from store to store with a ruler, measuring the vegetables until he found enough that were the right size.

Yerves (seen with his girlfriend) said he had to work 20-hour shifts, six days a week, on very little sleep and that he was screamed at for things like making too much noise in the kitchen

After spending more than two hours gathering the perfect peppers, he said most of them ended up being thrown in the trash by the sous-chef.

He claimed he would see 'bins upon bins' of wasted produce get thrown out, despite EMP's owner and head chef, Daniel Humm, often preaching about the restaurants 'commitment to sustainability.'

Yerves quit the 'egotistical' restaurant in November, and he now works at Cut by Wolfgang Puck.

'It was definitely a huge toll on my mental health,' he told the outlet during a recent interview. 'It was definitely the most egotistical restaurant I've ever been in in my life.'

In a previous story published by Insider, more former staff members - as well as current employees - at the prestigious three-star Michelin restaurant spoke out about their negative experiences while working there, claiming that the 's**t show' eatery is more focused on appearances than making good food.

The staffers - most of whom decided to remain anonymous - said the establishment was plagued with understaffing and chaos after head chef Humm, 46, turned everything vegan during its reopening last year.

Yerves said it took 'a huge toll' on his mental health' before he quit in November, calling it 'the most egotistical restaurant he's ever been in in his life'

Following the surprise move, employees said there was a mass exodus and new hires got burned out quickly, all while Humm allegedly reveled in his status as a celebrity chef who was dating actress Demi Moore.

On top of Yerves, six other former employees said that they too ditched the restaurant due to low pay, long hours, and a lack of support.

'There were suddenly sous-chefs who were walking out of the restaurant,' one line cook, who quit in 2021, told Insider.

'There were cooks who were walking out of the restaurant. It was just, to put it very simply, a s**t show.'

A representative for the restaurant - which charges $335-a-person for a pre-set 11-course tasting meal - said in a statement that Humm was proud of his work at EMP, and that he had no plans to change anything amid the 'flat-out erroneous critiques.'

'When Daniel reopened Eleven Madison Park post-pandemic, he told the New York Times that ""we couldn't go back to doing what we did before,''' the rep wrote. 'Neither the restaurant nor the plan to retreat from these necessary changes due to some mostly anonymous and flat-out erroneous critiques from former employees, competitors. and other agenda-driven sources.'

Despite Humm's vow that he was deeply committed to the restaurant, former employees told Insider that the chef rarely visited the kitchen unless it was to take VIP guests on tours.

Yerves recalled one such alleged instance, which came last year when actor Woody Harrelson stopped by the restaurant, claiming that Humm danced around the kitchen and lit up a joint, disgusting some employees.

'He acted like an idiot,' a former front-of-house said. 'We kind of felt that [Humm] had lost touch with everything.'

One of the biggest irks for the employees was Humm's alleged refusal to raise their wages from the city's $15 an hour minimum, a blow to their wallets that was only compounded by EMP's banning of tips.

An anonymous former employee told Insider that they once had to refuse a generous $1,000 tip from Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who they said seemed 'insulted' by the rejection.

The low-pay, coupled with long hours at EMP - where it's not unusual to work an 80-hour-work week - had even caused some to break down during their shifts, one staffer alleged.

Humm had announced his plans to reopen as a vegan establishment last year, a message that came to the surprise of both customers and employees alike

A representative for the restaurant said that Humm (pictured with his daughters) was proud of his work at EMP, and had no plans to change anything amid the 'flat-out erroneous critiques'

'Everyone was depressed,' the former kitchen employee said. 'Everyone was like, ""This place is not OK.'''

Arielle Smith, who worked as a maître d' from the relaunch until this past February, told the outlet that while she was grateful for her job at EMP, she saw the culture and experience at the acclaimed restaurant plummet during her short stay.

'This is the new EMP, and everybody is new, and no one really knows how to do this at the level that they've been doing it,' she explained.

Humm's restaurant fell into trouble last October after his vegan menu received a scathing review in the New York Times, with the outlet slamming the fact that those who booked a private dining room in the back of the restaurant could still order meat.

New York Times critic Pete Wells had little time for a dehydrated beetroot dish served in a clay pot that is broken open at the table, saying it 'tasted like Lemon Pledge and smelled like a burning joint.'

One of the biggest irks for the employees was Humm's alleged refusal to raise their wages from $15 an hour. Cucumber with melon and smoked daikon - a dish on the menu is pictured

It was also said the Humm banned customers from tipping employees. Eggplant with tomato and cilantro, another dish on the 11-course menu, is pictured

The vegetables, Wells said, were 'doing things no root vegetable should be asked to do,' and he accused Humm of manipulating the ingredients far beyond necessary.

A tomato dish was described by Wells as having a 'pumped-up, distorted flavor, like tomatoes run through a wah-wah pedal' - a device used by musicians to distort the sound of an electric guitar.

Eleven Madison Park won its first Michelin star in 2010. The following year - the same year it was taken over by Humm - it joined the elite group of three-starred restaurants - an accolade it has maintained until the last ranking, in May 2021.

There are only 134 three-starred restaurants in the world; France and Japan have 29 each, and there are 14 in the United States. New York City currently has five - the same number as London.",Q2
https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-oklahoma-abortion-ban-could-affect-texas/,Oklahoma’s governor has signed a Texas-style abortion ban. Here’s how it could affect Texas,"From The Texas Newsroom:

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a Republican-backed bill modeled after Texas’ law banning abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It took effect immediately.

He already signed a bill into law last month making it a felony to perform an abortion with one exception. Another measure still making its way through that state’s legislature bans all abortions, except in certain cases like rape or incest.

This comes as the U.S. Supreme Court — which has a conservative majority — could soon overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.

For now, Seema Mohapatra, a visiting professor of law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said Oklahoma’s new Texas-style law won’t just affect that state’s citizens, but will also impact Texans seeking to have the procedure.

“Oklahoma abortion care providers were reporting that many of their patients were Texas residents after SB 8 [Texas’ abortion law] passed, and they had an increase in the number of patients that they were seeing,” Mohapatra said. “And so, in terms of the proximity between Oklahoma and Texas, that access is now cut off as well.”

According to researchers with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project , nearly half of the Texans who traveled out of state to get an abortion between September and December 2021 obtained the procedure in Oklahoma after Senate Bill 8 took effect Sept. 1.

TxPEP’s research also showed that a large number of Texans traveled to Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico for out-of-state abortions as well. That’s an average of about 1,400 Texans per month .

The only enforcement mechanism for Texas’ law is allowing private citizens to sue anyone involved in helping someone get the procedure. Oklahoma’s new law has a similar provision.

Meanwhile, as the nation awaits a decision on Roe, Mohapatra expects more states will try to pass similar Texas-style measures as well as other bills that lessen access to abortion.

“With the leaked opinion, states are going to be even more aggressive in the kinds of anti-abortion legislation that they’re going to pass because they know that a decision is forthcoming that is going to overturn Roe. v. Wade,” said Mohapatra.

A federal appeals court recently ended a lawsuit from abortion providers seeking to overturn Texas’ abortion law by instructing a lower district to dismiss all charges.

Abortion providers, including Whole Woman’s Health and Planned Parenthood, had sued over an enforcement aspect of Texas’ six-week abortion ban.

At issue was whether Texas medical licensing officials could punish physicians who violate the law since they were the only defendants allowed to be left in the lawsuit by the U.S. Supreme Court in a December ruling. But, the Texas Supreme Court later ruled in March that those officials did not have the authority to enforce the ban.

“So, there’s no one to sue,” Mohapatra said. “There’s no kind of repercussions for that rule, and other states are seeing that and copying it.”

Idaho was the first state to pass a Texas-style abortion ban, and it was signed into law by that state’s governor in March. It was set to go into effect last month, but Idaho’s Supreme Court temporarily blocked the law as legal challenges there proceed.",Q2
https://www.wtxl.com/news/florida-news/concerns-over-increases-in-eviction-filings-reignite-concerns-over-tainted-tenant-records,Concerns over increases in eviction filings reignite concerns over tainted tenant records,"TAMPA, Fla. — As lawmakers in Tallahassee battle the state’s insurance crisis, what’s not on the special agenda this week — Florida’s rapidly intensifying affordable housing crisis.

With this crisis, comes growing concerns the end to the state’s rental assistance program, known as ""Our Florida,” will be swiftly followed by an increase in new eviction filings.

Mathilda Dameus of Palm Beach County is still recovering from her eviction.

In November, her landlord filed an eviction against her after claiming she owed thousands of dollars in back rent.

While Dameus claims her landlord didn’t tell her she owed money for missing weeks until a year after she moved in, Dameus was approved for funding help from ""Our Florida."" The program paid her landlord $13,000 for back rent and future payments.

Still, Dameus was evicted, leaving the single mom living with the scar of an eviction for the next seven years.

“When another landlord or another owner sees that you have an eviction on your record, it's basically like you're a black sheep. It’s like, no, I don't want to deal with you,"" she said. ""I don't care what the story is.""

The issues caused by eviction filings are not new. However, more attention has been given since the fall-out from the COVID pandemic has left more Floridians facing eviction for the first time.

In addition, rising rents are making it that much harder for evicted renters to move on from those cases.

“As much as we want landlords, obviously, to get their rent and to continue to maintain units, tenants need housing as well. And so if COVID-19 is a factor in keeping these evictions on the record, I would say that it is unfair,” Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County attorney Amy Pettway said

Pettway represented Dameus and is currently representing other clients facing eviction for the first time. She believes some evicted tenants should be able to get their evictions sealed from the public when cases are settled or dismissed and landlords are made whole.

“Right now, what we're seeing is that if the eviction is there, and a tenant is applying for another house or another unit, the landlord automatically looks at that eviction and says, 'Oh you know, you don't qualify,'” Pettway said.

While individual judges can agree to expunge a tenant’s eviction, most judges don’t because proving it’s necessary is a tough burden for tenants to meet.

“The damage is done when the filing is done,” Bay Area Legal Services attorney Tim Difiore said.

His organization in Tampa Bay has also been deluged with renters facing evictions for the first time and the repercussions that come with it, even when a case is settled or dismissed.

“It’s the equivalent to being arrested or charged for something but not convicted,” he said. “That’s how a landlord can potentially view that.”

Earlier this year, a bill introduced would have allowed certain renters dealing with first time evictions to keep their eviction hidden from the public. While the bill passed the House, it went nowhere in the Senate.

It’s unknown just how many evictions have been filed in Florida. There is no single database that keeps track of the information. It is also unknown how many of these filing end up being settled or dismissed.

“We believe it's critical for housing providers to have access to a variety of information when evaluating a potential resident,” said Director of Government Affairs for Florida’s Apartment Association Amanda White said.

White disputes common beliefs that landlords look at a single filing as reason to turn a potential new client away.

“A mere filing for an eviction is typically not something that would cause concern,"" she said ""The housing provider is really looking for repeat filings, for example, or instances where the resident owes a substantial amount of money to the previous housing providers.""

White also said landlords continue to working with renters in securing housing help and evictions are always the “last resort.”

Dameus has found a new place of her own but not first without paying more to move in and move on.

“You rob Peter to pay Paul to make sure that Paul gets paid so you can move in,"" she said. ""It just seems unnecessary.""

Tenants struggling to pay rent are advised to immediately apply for help. While the “Our Florida” program has ended, many local governments are still offering rental assistance programs.",Q2
https://www.deseret.com/2022/6/5/23148521/mike-lee-school-mass-shooting-uvalde-fatherlessness-family-structure-gun-violence-dickey-amendment,"BYU, UVA UC Berkeley experts on fatherlessness and mass shootings – Deseret News","As Americans continue to question what leads someone to pick up a gun and shoot strangers — especially children who are simply attending school — some, including Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, are debating what role family relationships and social breakdown play.

After the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two adults were murdered, Lee speculated that “fatherlessness” and family breakdown may drive young men to kill. The remark, made in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, has been widely reported by national news outlets, triggering a response from experts who research family structure and its impacts.

Lee asked, “Why is our culture suddenly producing so many young men who want to murder innocent people? ... It raises questions like, you know, could things like fatherlessness, the breakdown of families, isolation from civil society or the glorification of violence be contributing factors?”

There’s an edge to many of the news reports on Lee’s comments, with some saying conservatives will consider everything but gun laws to explain gun violence. Others say liberals won’t consider anything but gun laws to end mass shootings.

Utah’s senior senator has been lambasted and praised for raising the issue of family breakdown.

In a Washington Examiner opinion piece, Timothy P. Carney defended Lee, saying Lee didn’t lay sole blame for mass shootings on fatherlessness. “Nobody has to say that in order to say that fatherlessness, like other instances of social breakdown, contributes to antisocial and violent behavior, with these mass shootings being the most horrific examples.”

Others say evidence doesn’t back up such a claim. Kevin Shafer, a professor of sociology at Brigham Young University, is among those noting that while other countries are very like the United States in terms of marriage and divorce rates, the amount of nonmarital births and dwindling church attendance, among other facts of family life, America stands alone for the sheer volume of mass shootings.

“In a complex behavior like mass shooting, it is unlikely that there would be one cause,” said Phil Cowan, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.

No expert told the Deseret News that family problems and troubled relationships don’t impact children or their future behaviors. But many doubt mass shootings can be laid at their door.

Crumbling society?

Lee bristles at some of the response his remarks in committee unleashed. He said reporting that homed in on fatherlessness and interpreted it as attacking single mothers willfully misrepresents what he said.

“I don’t ever associate fatherlessness with blame on a single mother,” he said. “That’s not how it works.”

He said he was calling out the absence of men as role models and mentors, as well as what he sees as a general breakdown in society. “We’ve seen some of our most fundamental institutions in civil society in the United States collapsing or at least eroding. When I speak of trends, of course they don’t refer to most Americans. I don’t mean to speak categorically, I just mean relative to prior eras of American history. People don’t know their neighbors as much as they once did. They’re not attending church as much as they once did. And more are experiencing loneliness and isolation, an estrangement from their fathers than they have in the past. The data show that is true,” he told the Deseret News.

Lee said the Social Capital Project he leads for the Joint Economic Committee Republicans finds clear evidence that social capital “is deeply important to our happiness and to our prosperity. And it’s in deep decline.”

Still, he added, “None of this is to suggest that a person who has a relationship with his father is incapable of these crimes. But you do see disproportionately reflected in those involved in these kinds of events a detachment from a functioning family — or maybe there’s a father there but there’s a lack of connection. From families to faith groups to communities, the detachment from all these institutions tends to be a major contributor to violent crime.”

Add in other factors like violent video games, “violent and destructive pornography” and radical forms of online groups that glorify hate and violence and he sees a “toxic, toxic recipe for disaster.”

Others agree.

“Sen. Mike Lee is right to wonder if fatherlessness and family breakdown are factors in the tidal wave of violence that has engulfed America since 2020,” said Brad Wilcox, a sociologist at the University of Virginia. “We know that young men who are raised without the benefit of good fathers are more likely to engage in violent behavior. Of course, other factors are also likely in play — from the effects of lockdowns and excessive screen time on the social and emotional well-being of young men to the ready availability of guns in our culture.”

Carney cited research to defend Lee’s point, including a 1997 study in Research in Crime and Delinquency that said the proportion of families that are fatherless is “the most reliable indicator of violent crime in a community.”

He also cited a 2019 metastudy from researchers in Amsterdam that said “growing up in single-parent families is associated with an elevated risk of involvement in crime by adolescents.” Those researchers called for more study to sort out why fathers were not in the home — parents divorced, never married or whether dad died — and how that might impact children.

However, other scholars and commentators see the discussion about family structure and civil society as more political than helpful.

“Conservatives who talk about family structure, fatherlessness or mental health after mass shootings are simply not serious,” said Philip N. Cohen, professor of sociology at the University of Maryland. “No serious policy analyst considers these actionable causes of America’s unique problem of mass shootings. Those are problems that exist everywhere, and nowhere else has our gun violence. Proof that they are not serious is that they have no policies to propose.”

Cohen said no policy proposed by “family conservatives” has reversed the decline of marriage or the rise of single parenthood.

“This is not and never has been a practical policy approach. It’s just ideological pandering. To raise this after a horrific tragedy like Uvalde or Buffalo is just taking up space in the news until the country’s attention moves on,” he said.

Evidence of family breakdown

Several experts told the Deseret News there’s a disconnect between what studies show and what often gets blamed for mass shootings.

The United States is roughly in the middle of rich countries for nonmarital births, Shafer said, but its gun violence rate is much higher than in any other rich country. When he posted that on Twitter, someone told him he was asking the wrong question and that he should be looking at the share who are single parents. So he did that, too.

“There’s also no relationship between the percent of single parents and gun violence rates within a country. That doesn’t appear to be a risk factor. If you look at marriage rates, that’s not protective. If you look at divorce rates, that doesn’t increase the rate of gun violence within a country,” Shafer said.

He believes that “unless fatherlessness has a unique effect in the United States that it doesn’t have elsewhere,” it doesn’t drive gun violence. “CDC data has repeatedly shown that nonresidential fathers are pretty involved dads, on average. We need to be much more nuanced in our arguments about these kinds of things and we need to be clear about what we’re actually talking about,” Shafer said.

Others point out that some children living in homes with their father have a strained relationship with him — or none at all. If a father is a my-way-or-else authoritarian, studies say the resulting parent-child connections don’t benefit children.

“You can’t just use these proxies for fatherlessness and say, ‘Well, there’s a relationship between those two things,’ because we’re not getting into the nitty-gritty of what dads are actually doing with their kids, whether these kids have father figures in their lives. It’s much more complex than it is often made to look,” said Shafer.

“Single mom” doesn’t necessarily mean raising kids without another parent. And “absent dad” may not mean he isn’t engaged in his children’s lives, several experts said.

A link or a cause?

When Stephanie Coontz taught students at The Evergreen State College about cause and correlation, she especially liked to use an example from her dad, an economist. He pointed out that when minister salaries went up, so did sales of scotch. One might assume that ministers were drinking, she said, but of course, both salaries and sales just went up in good economic times.

Coontz, director of research and education for the Council on Contemporary Families, believes many nuances hide beneath broad labels. While divorce is often hard on kids, it can be an improvement if parents constantly fought and were stressed. Some households do OK after divorce; others really struggle.

“Often the ones who struggle may struggle worse after a breakup,” she said, “but their struggles before are why the marriage broke up.”

Coontz said people who live in economic scarcity often move in quickly with each other, end up having a baby and then realize they’re in an abusive or otherwise bad situation. There are good reasons to leave a family structure that doesn’t work.

While a somewhat higher percentage of kids from one-parent homes turn to violence, the overwhelming majority of kids from one-parent homes do not, she said. “And when we look at those who do, we find that often the social experiences and family-community patterns that help explain their violence were also what caused the family instability, so that the family form was a symptom, not a cause of the factors that led the child to violence.”

Unstable relationships, chronic economic stress, being exposed to violence in a community, being surrounded by deteriorating infrastructure and disadvantaged neighborhoods — all those can have more impact than family structure does, several experts said.

As a sociologist, Shannon Cavanagh said she applauds Lee’s call to consider what causes so many “young, white cisgendered men to engage in these horrific acts of terror.”

But Cavanagh, professor of sociology and postdoctoral training director at the University of Texas at Austin’s Population Research Center, said she doesn’t find “fatherlessness” a particularly compelling explanation for Uvalde and other mass shootings. The Columbine killers were both raised with two parents. One father was in the military and the other was very active in the church, for example, she said.

“That alone doesn’t mean the family environment doesn’t matter, but it certainly weakens his claim,” she said.

Some experts say it’s too easy to try to offer simple explanations like family structure or mental health to explain a horrific attack. Often, the motives behind attacks never do become clear.

After Lee brought up family breakdown, Shawn Fremstad, a scholar at the Center for Economic Policy Research, said he did some digging.

“Mass shootings are extreme events, so we don’t have a lot of demographic or survey data to look at, but there is no evidence-based reason for believing that mass shootings are caused by single mothers, grandmothers who raised their grandchildren or lesbian couples, all examples of “fatherless” household arrangements,” he said.

Evidence on more common events than mass shootings isn’t conclusive, either, he noted. Although lots of studies have considered the effects of single parenthood on child well-being, agreement on causal effect is lacking. It’s easier to say with confidence that “any such effect is small,” Fremstad said.

Despite divergent opinions on a lot of things, experts seem to agree on one thing: Strong families do matter. Children benefit when parents are engaged, supportive and are committed to their children’s well-being and helping them flourish.

Where they disagree is whether those strong families will solve all gun violence or if something else is at play, too.

“I don’t know how many of the shooters grew up without fathers, or grew up in disorganized families, but I do know that almost all of the fatherless children or children of split families do not grow up to be criminals, shooters or mentally ill. While it is true that family breakdown increases the risk of bad outcomes, it doesn’t function as a main cause of bad outcomes,” Cowan said.

Glorifying violence

Cavanagh is among those who believe you can’t solve gun violence without considering the gun part of what happened.

“What is clear in all of these killings is the easy access to guns, guns that allow these young men who are very likely detached from civil society, to do unthinkable harm to children, families, and communities, including fathers,” she said.

Others — including Lee — are concerned about the role of violent movies, violent video games and violent pornography, among other challenges.

Shafer prefaces his comments about the cause by pointing out that “it’s really hard to look at the relationship between any variable and gun violence in the United States because Congress has made it almost impossible to study. We lack the data.”

He’s referring to the Dickey Amendment, which for close to two decades was included in the budget, forbidding the use of federal funds to study gun violence.

The amendment was not included in the 2020 fiscal year budget, but it’s expected to take time for studies on gun violence to learn much. That budget allocated $25 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to research reducing gun-related deaths and injuries. Stories at the time said it was the first such funding since 1996.

Lee said part of Congress’ job is figuring out what would make a difference and what wouldn’t, all within the framework of the Constitution.

He points out that the video games, movies and writing that glorify violence carry constitutional free speech protections. “And while they’re destructive, we understand that’s part of living in a free society,” he said.

Lee rejects the idea of repealing the Second Amendment. He said he tries to look at each gun proposal to see how it would deter violent crime. But any proposal has to be balanced against the impact on law-abiding citizens, too, he said.

As for getting rid of AR-15s, he said that’s a popular gun often owned by law-abiding citizens — which the Constitution protects. And he views proposals to ban categories of weapons through that Second Amendment lens.

Conquering the societal problem of social isolation would better reduce mass shootings, he said. But “those aren’t things that are easily amenable to government intervention.”

Because social media companies have sophisticated artificial intelligence that could flag those who express a desire to be mass murderers or who outline their plans, Lee said he thinks the companies might be convinced — or even compelled — to alert authorities.

Society has already agreed felons, people convicted of domestic violence and some other groups should not be able to own guns. Lee said he’s willing to consider arguments that others should be prohibited, too.

“I do think it can be helpful for us to examine the laws that we’ve already got and figure out where things broke down with regard to enforcement,” he said.

Looking forward

Cowan is among those calling for policymakers to get serious about reducing access to high-powered guns and increasing access to social support.

“Why are politicians ignoring the obvious conclusion that reducing access to certain kinds of guns — not all guns — could reduce mass shootings? he asked. “And while they’re at it, they could increase funds for family support because that would do other good things for the country.”

Cavanagh agrees that lawmakers who want to support children and strengthen families should support “legislation like paid family leave (to) make it easier for partners to stay together and take care of their kids, student loan debt relief (to) make college seem like an option for young people and an assault-weapons ban — obviously — among other things.”

Shafer hopes the government will earmark money to study what perpetuates shootings.

“My hope is that they’ll put money behind their hypothesis and that we can really firmly understand this and we don’t have to look at correlations across countries to better try to understand this phenomenon. That we truly empirically studied the question,” he said.",Q2

https://www.khaleejtimes.com/americas/new-york-city-to-pay-10-5-million-settlement-for-wrongful-murder-conviction,New York City to pay $10.5 million settlement for wrongful murder conviction,"New York City will pay $10.5 million to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by a man who spent 24 years in prison on a murder conviction that was overturned after a witness who had placed him at the crime scene recanted, city officials said Thursday.

The conviction of Shawn Williams, who was freed in 2018, was the 14th overturned conviction linked to retired Detective Louis Scarcella, a former Brooklyn homicide detective who has been accused of coercing witnesses and framing suspects during the high-crime era of the late 1980s and 1990s.

Williams, who is now 47, was convicted in 1994 in the fatal shooting of his neighbour Marvin Mason the year before.

Due to the absence of any forensic evidence tying Williams to the crime, prosecutors relied on the testimony of a woman who said she had seen him at the scene with a gun.

The woman recanted her testimony in 2013, saying she had been coerced into naming Williams as the gunman by Scarcella.

The $10.5 million settlement with Williams to settle his lawsuit against Scarcella and two other officers was first reported in The New York Times.

“No amount of money can give me back the years they took from me,” Williams said in a statement to the Times.

“But I am going to keep rebuilding my life and looking ahead to a brighter future.”

A spokesperson for New York City's law department said the settlement was in the best interest of all parties.

The city has paid millions of dollars in settlements over other cases linked to Scarcella, who has denied any wrongdoing.

Richard Signorelli, an attorney for Scarcella, said the retired detective “categorically denies all the allegations of misconduct” in Williams' case. Signorelli said the settlement agreement “does not constitute any admission of liability or wrongdoing on Det. Scarcella's part.”",Q2
https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/Pages/General-Article.aspx?ArticleID=29005,WisBar Court Review: Intimidating Statements by Anti-Abortion Protestor Not Protected Speech:,"March 29, 2022 – A circuit court properly entered an injunction against an anti-abortion protestor who repeatedly made intimidating statements to a nurse who worked at clinic, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals has ruled.

In Kindschy v. Aish, 2020AP1775 (March 8, 2022), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals District III held the protestor’s conduct was not protected by the First Amendment.

‘You Have Time to Repent'

Between 2019 and 2020, Brian Aish protested at the Blair Health Center in Trempealeau County, where Kindschy worked. Planned Parenthood provides family planning services at the clinic but abortions are not performed there.

Jeff M. Brown is a legal writer for the State Bar of Wisconsin, Madison. He can be reached by email or by phone at (608) 250-6126.

In March 2020, Kindschy filed for a harassment injunction against Aish in Trempealeau County Circuit Court. She claimed that Aish had threatened her on multiple occasions, causing her to feel unsafe.

Kindschy testified that in the autumn of 2019, Aish became aggressive and confrontational towards her.

On Oct. 18, 2019, Aish – standing about three feet away from Kindschy’s car – told Kindschy “You have time to repent. You will be lucky if you don’t get killed by a drunk driver on your way home. Bad things are going to start happening to you and your family.”

‘You Have Blood on Your Hands’

One week later, Kindschy testified, Aish walked up to her as she was leaving the clinic and spoke to her loudly in a cold and angry tone: “You have blood on your hands.”

Later in October 2019, Aish ran into the road as Kindschy was leaving the clinic and pumped an anti-abortion sign to within inches of her car window.

In February 2020, Aish followed Kindschy as she walked to her vehicle outside the clinic. He told Kindschy that she would be lucky to make it home safely; he also told her that she could be killed and that bad things would start happening to her family.

One week later, Aish accused Kindschy of lying about him to the authorities. Again, he said, Kindschy would be lucky to get home safely. These statements caused Kindschy great worry.

Court Issues Injunction

The circuit court ruled that Aish had repeatedly intimidated and harassed Kindschy. The circuit found that Aish’s statements that Kindschy would be lucky to make it home alive and that bad things would start happening to her family were threatening.

The circuit court also found that Aish had used intimidation in an effort to scare Kindschy into quitting her job. The circuit court issued an injunction that prohibited Aish from harassing Kindschy.

The injunction also required Aish to avoid Kindschy’s home and any premises that Kindschy temporarily occupied, including the clinic, until Sept. 9, 2024.

After the circuit court denied Aish’s motion for reconsideration, Aish appealed.

Evidence Supports Circuit Court’s Ruling

Before the court of appeals, Aish argued that the circuit court’s ruling violated his right to assemble and his right to free expression under the First Amendment.

Writing for a three-judge panel, Judge Gregory Gill explained that the circuit court had reasonable grounds to believe that Aish had engaged in harassment with the intent to intimidate Kindschy under Wis. Stat. section 813.125(4)(a)3.

Aish argued that the circuit court had no evidence and had made no finding that he’d threatened Kindschy or suggested that he would play a role in any bad thing that might happen to Kindschy or her family.

But Gill explained that, given the applicable standard of review, the court of appeals would not second-guess the circuit court’s credibility determination.

And while Aish argued that there was evidence that contradicted the circuit court’s findings, Judge Gill pointed out that he did not argue that the findings were clearly erroneous.

“Here, the evidence clearly supports the court’s findings that Aish harassed Kindschy and intimidated her,” Gill wrote. “Kindschy testified that she was very frightened not only by Aish’s proximity and his words, but the change in his demeanor.”

Clinic Added Guard, Cameras

Aish argued that his statements did nothing more than alert Kindschy to “the reality of commonplace but serious dangers,” and lacked any explicit or suggested causal relationship to him.

That argument was undercut by both the record and the findings made by the circuit court, Judge Gill explained.

“Kindschy testified that she was scared of Aish as a result of the comments he made to her, not that she was suddenly fearful that she or her family might be the victim of some wholly unrelated accident,” Gill wrote.

Judge Gill pointed out that in response to Kindschy’s concerns about Aish, the clinic installed cameras and hired a security guard.

Judge Gill explained that the evidence was sufficient to support the circuit court’s finding that Aish had engaged in a pattern of harassing or intimidating conduct under section 813.125(1)(am)4.b.

Free Expression or Fear Inducement?

Aish argued that his conduct was motivated by two goals protected by the First Amendment: to convince Kindschy to quit the clinic, and to proselytize.

The court of appeals accepted that Aish intended to convince Kindschy to quit the clinic and to proselytize. However, Judge Gill explained, the circuit court found that Aish also intended to frighten Kindschy.

“Harassing behavior cannot be transformed into nonharrassing, legitimate conduct simply be labeling it as a political protest,” Judge Gill wrote.

Conduct Was Private, Not Public

In response to Aish’s argument that the injunction violated his First Amendment rights, Judge Gill explained that the right to protest has limits.

Gill pointed out that in 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Colorado statute that banned anti-abortion protestors from coming up to patients or employees going in or out of clinics.

Furthermore, Aish’s conduct was not entitled to special protection because it was public in nature, Judge Gill explained.

“Aish was attempting to convince a private citizen to end her employment with a private organization, by making comments that instilled fear and trepidation,” Judge Gill wrote. “Aish’s efforts were almost entirely personal—and not public—in nature.”

https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/04/28/civilian-deaths-beyond-bucha/,Civilian Deaths Beyond Bucha,"Madogaz Musa Abdullah still remembers the phone call. But what came next was a blur. He drove for hours, deep into the Libyan desert, speeding toward the border with Algeria. His mind buckled, his thoughts reeled, and more than three years later, he’s still not certain how he made that six-hour journey.

The call was about his younger brother, Nasser, who, as he told me, was more than a sibling to him. He was also a close friend. Nasser was polite and caring. He loved music, sang, and played the guitar. Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, and Bob Marley were his favorites.

Abdullah finally found Nasser near the village of Al Awaynat. Or, rather, he found all that remained of him. Nasser and 10 others from their village of Ubari had been riding in three SUVs that were now burnt-out hunks of metal. The 11 men had been incinerated. Abdullah knew one of those charred corpses was his brother, but he was at a loss to identify which one.

If these bodies had recently been found strewn about in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in the streets of Bucha, outside a train station in Kramatorsk, or elsewhere in Ukraine where Russian forces have regularly killed civilians, the images would have been splashed across the Internet, earning worldwide attention and prompting fierce — and justified — outrage. Instead, the day after the attack, November 29, 2018, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) issued a press release that was met with almost universal silence.

“In coordination with the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA), U.S. Africa Command conducted a precision airstrike near Al Awaynat, Libya, November 29, 2018, killing eleven (11) al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) terrorists and destroying three (3) vehicles,” it read. “At this time, we assess no civilians were injured or killed in this strike.” Photos of the aftermath of the attack, posted on Twitter that same day, have been retweeted less than 30 times in the last three and a half years.

Ever since then, Abdullah and his Tuareg community in Ubari have been insisting to anyone who would listen that Nasser and the others riding in those vehicles were civilians. And not just civilians, but GNA veterans who had fought terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and even, alongside the United States two years earlier, the Islamic State in the city of Sirte. For more than three years now, despite public protests and pleas to the Libyan government for an impartial investigation, the inhabitants of Ubari have been ignored. “Before the strike, we trusted AFRICOM. We believed that they worked for the Libyan people,” Abdullah told me. “Now, they have no credibility. Now, we know that they kill innocent people.”

Hellfire in Libya

Earlier this month, Abdullah, along with a spokesperson for his ethnic Tuareg community and representatives of three nongovernmental organizations — the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, Italy’s Rete Italiana Pace e Disarmo, and Reprieve, a human rights advocacy group — filed a criminal complaintagainst Colonel Gianluca Chiriatti, the former Italian commander at the U.S. air base in Sigonella, Italy, from which that American drone took off. They were seeking accountability for his role in the killing of Nasser and those other 10 men. The complainants requested that the public prosecutor’s office in Siracusa, where the base is located, prosecute Colonel Chiriatti and other Italian officials involved in that air strike for the crime of murder.

“The drone attack of 29 November 2018 where 11 innocent people lost their lives in Libya is part of the broader U.S. program of extrajudicial killings. This program is based on a notion of pre-emptive self-defense that does not meet the canons of international law, as the use of lethal attacks of this nature is only legitimate where the state is acting to defend itself against an imminent threat to life. In this circumstance, the victims posed no threat,” reads the criminal complaint. “In light of this premise, the drone attack on Al Awaynat on 29 November 2018 stands in frontal contrast to the discipline, Italian and international, regarding the use of lethal force in the context of law enforcement operations.”

For the last two decades, the United States has been conducting an undeclared war across much of the globe, employing proxy forces from Africa to Asia, deploying commandos from the Philippines to the West African nation of Burkina Faso, and conducting air strikes not only in Libya, but in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. Over those years, the U.S. military has taken pains to normalize the use of drone warfare outside established war zones while relying on allies around the world (as at that Italian base in Siracusa) to help conduct its global war.

“Clearly, a drone operation employing lethal force is not routine,” said Chantal Meloni, legal advisor at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights. “While AFRICOM is directly responsible, the Italian commander must have known about and approved the operation and can therefore be criminally responsible as an accomplice for having allowed the unlawful lethal attack.”

That November 2018 drone attack in Libya was anything but a one-off strike. During just six months in 2011, alone, U.S. MQ-1 Predator drones flying from Sigonella conducted 241 air strikes in Libya during Operation Unified Protector — the NATO air campaign against then-Libyan autocrat Muammar Gaddafi — according to retired Lt. Col. Gary Peppers, the former commander of the 324th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron. The unit was responsible, he told The Intercept in 2018, for “over 20 percent of the total of all Hellfire [missiles] expended in the 14 years of the system’s deployment.”

The U.S. air war in Libya accelerated in 2016 with Operation Odyssey Lightning. That summer, the Libyan Government of National Accord requested American help in dislodging Islamic State fighters from Sirte. The Obama administration designatedthe city an “area of active hostilities,” loosening guidelines designed to prevent civilian casualties. Between August and December of that year, according to an AFRICOM press release, the U.S. carried out in Sirte alone “495 precision airstrikes against Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices, heavy guns, tanks, command and control centers, and fighting positions.”

The Shores of Tripoli

Those military strikes were nothing new. The United States has been conducting attacks in Libya since before there even was a Libya — and almost a United States. In his first address to Congress in 1801, President Thomas Jefferson spoke of coastal kingdoms in North Africa, including the “least considerable of the Barbary States,” Tripoli (now, the capital of modern Libya). His refusal to pay additional tribute to the rulers of those kingdoms in order to stop their state-sponsored privateers from seizing American sailors and cargo kicked off the Barbary Wars. In 1804, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a daring nighttime mission, boarding a captured U.S. ship, killing its Tripolitan defenders, and destroying it. And an attack the next year by nine Marines and a host of allied mercenaries on the North African city of Derna ensured that “the shores of Tripoli” would have prime placement in the Marine Corps hymn.

Libya has also been a long-time proving ground for new forms of air war. In November 1911 — 107 years to the month before that drone attack killed Nasser Musa Abdullah — Italian Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti conducted the world’s first modern airstrike. “Today I have decided to try to throw bombs from the aeroplane,” he wrote in a letter to his father, while deployed in Libya to fight forces loyal to the Ottoman Empire. “I take the bomb with my right hand, pull off the security tag and throw the bomb out, avoiding the wing.”

Gavotti not only pioneered the idea of launching air raids on troops far from the traditional front lines of a war, but also the targeting of civilian infrastructure when he bombed an oasis that served as a social and economic center. As Thomas Hippler put it in his book Governing from the Skies, Gavotti introduced aerial attacks on “hybrid target[s]” that “indifferently mingled civilian and military objectives.”

More than a century later, in 2016, Operation Odyssey Lightning again made Libya ground zero for the testing of new air-war concepts — in this case, urban combat involving multiple drones working in combination with local troops and U.S. Special Operations forces. As one of the drone pilots involved was quoted as saying in an Air Force news release: “Some of the tactics were created and some of the persistent attack capabilities that hadn’t been used widely before were developed because of this operation.”

According to Colonel Case Cunningham, commander of the 432nd Expeditionary Wing at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada — the headquarters of the Air Force’s drone operations — about 70% of the MQ-9 Reaper drone strikes conducted during Odyssey Lightning were close-air-support missions backing up local Libyan forces engaged in street-to-street combat. The drones, he reported, often worked in tandem with one another, as well as with Marine Corps attack helicopters and jets, helping guide the airstrikes of those conventional aircraft.

“The Deaths of Thousands of Civilians”

Despite hundreds of attacks in support of the Libyan Government of National Accord, the employment of U.S. proxies in counterterrorism missions, combat by American commandos, and more than $850 million in U.S. assistance since 2011, Libya remains one of the most fragile states on earth. Earlier this year, President Biden renewed its “national emergency” status (first invoked by President Barack Obama in 2011). “Civil conflict in Libya will continue until Libyans resolve their political divisions and foreign military intervention ends,” wrote Biden, failing to mention the U.S. “foreign military intervention” there, including that November 2018 airstrike. “The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.”

In early 2021, the Biden administration imposed limits on drone strikes and commando raids outside of conventional war zones, while launching a review of all such missions, and began writing a new “playbook” to govern counterterrorism operations. More than a year later, the results, or lack thereof, have yet to be made public. In January, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin directed subordinates to draw up a “Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Plan” within 90 days. That, too, has yet to be released.

Until the Defense Department overhauls its airstrike policies, civilians will continue to die in attacks. “The U.S. military has a systemic targeting problem that will continue to cost civilians their lives,” said Marc Garlasco, formerly the Pentagon’s chief of high-value targeting — in charge, that is, of the effort to kill Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein in 2003 — and now, the military adviser for PAX, a Dutch civilian protection organization. “Civilian deaths are not discrete events; they are symptoms of larger problems such as a lack of proper investigations, a faulty collateral-damage estimation methodology, overreliance on intelligence without considering open-source data, and a policy that does not recognize the presumption of civilian status.”

Such “larger problems” have been revealed again and again. Last March, for example, the Yemen-based group Mwatana for Human Rights released a report examining 12 U.S. attacks in Yemen, 10 of them airstrikes, between January 2017 and January 2019. Its researchers found that at least 38 Yemeni noncombatants had been killed and seven others injured in those attacks.

A June 2021 Pentagon report on civilian casualties did acknowledge one of those incidents, the death of a civilian in al-Bayda, Yemen, on January 22, 2019. Mwatana’s investigation determined that the attack killed Saleh Ahmed Mohamed al Qaisi, a 67-year-old farmer who locals said had no terrorist affiliations. The U.S. had previously acknowledged four to 12 civilian deaths in a raid by Navy SEALs on January 29, 2017, also chronicled by Mwatana (though it reported a higher death toll). As for the remaining allegations, Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East, told Mwatana in an April 2021 letter that it was “confident that each airstrike hit its intended Al Qaeda targets and nothing else.”

Rigorous investigative reporting by the New York Times on the last U.S. drone strikeof the Afghan War in August 2021 forced an admission from the Pentagon. What General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had originally deemed a “righteous strike” had actually killed 10 civilians, seven of them children. A subsequent Times investigation revealed that a 2019 U.S. airstrike in Baghuz, Syria, had killed up to 64 noncombatants, a toll previously obscured through a multilayered cover-up. The Times followed that up with an investigation of 1,300 reports of civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria, demonstrating, wrote reporter Azmat Khan, that the American air war in those countries was “marked by deeply flawed intelligence, rushed and often imprecise targeting, and the deaths of thousands of civilians, many of them children, a sharp contrast to the American government’s image of war waged by all-seeing drones and precision bombs.”

Since the Sirte campaign ended in late 2016, U.S. attacks in Libya have slowed considerably. AFRICOM conducted seven declared airstrikes there in 2017, six in 2018, four in 2019, and none since. But the U.S. military has made little effort to reevaluate past strikes and the civilian casualties they caused, including the November 2018 attack that killed Nasser Musa Abdullah. “U.S. Africa Command followed the civilian casualty assessment process in place at the time and determined that the reports were unsubstantiated,” said AFRICOM spokesperson Kelly Cahalan. Despite the criminal complaint filed on April 1st, the command is not reexamining the case. “There is nothing new or different regarding the Nov 30, 2018 airstrike,” Cahalan told me by email.

Africa Command has clearly moved on, but Abdullah can’t. Memories of his brother and those charred bodies are irrevocably lodged in his mind but get caught in his throat. “I was in shock,” he told me when discussing the phone call that preceeded his dash across the desert. “I’m so sorry, but I can’t explain in words what I felt.”

Abdullah was similarly stuck when he attempted to describe the grisly scene that greeted him hours later. He was eloquent in speaking about the justice he seeks and how being branded a “terrorist” robbed his brother and their community of dignity. But of his final memory of Nasser, there is simply nothing that can be said, not by him anyway. “What I saw was so terrible,” he told me, his voice rising, ragged and loaded with pain. “I can’t even describe it.”

The hearing Thursday will bring attention to a memorably turbulent stretch at the department as Trump in his final days in office sought to bend to his will a law enforcement agency that has long cherished its independence from the White House. The testimony is aimed at showing how Trump not only relied on outside advisers to press his election fraud claims, but also tried to leverage the powers of federal executive branch agencies.

Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are WATCH HERE WATCH HERE

The witnesses will include Jeffrey Rosen, who was acting attorney general during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Three days earlier, Rosen was part of a tense Oval Office showdown in which Trump contemplated replacing him with a lower-level official, Jeffrey Clark, who wanted to champion Trump's claims of election fraud.

Two other former department officials, Rosen's top deputy, Richard Donoghue, and Steven Engel, are also scheduled to testify. Both warned Trump at the White House meeting that they'd resign, and that many of the department's lawyers would follow, if he replaced Rosen with Clark.

“You could have a situation here, within 24 hours, you have hundreds of people resigning from the Justice Department,” Donoghue has said he told Trump. “Is that good for anyone? Is it good for the department? Is it good for the country? Is it good for you. It's not.”

Only then did Trump relent. The night, and later his administration, ended with Rosen still in power.

In taped testimony to the House special committee on the U.S. Capitol Riot, former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr expressed concerns he had over “how crazy” former President Donald Trump’s election fraud claims appeared.

The hearing is the fifth this month by the committee investigating the run-up to the insurrection at the Capitol, when Trump loyalists stormed the building as lawmakers were certifying the results of the election won by Joe Biden. Witnesses have included police officers attacked at the Capitol as well as lawyers, a television executive and local election officials who all resisted demands to alter results in Trump's favor.

The committee last week presented videotaped depositions of former Attorney General William Barr, who castigated Trump's fraud claims as “bull—,” “bogus” and “idiotic” and resigned after failing to convince the president of that.

Thursday's hearing will focus on what happened next as Rosen, Barr's top deputy, took over the department and found himself immediately besieged by Trump's demands for Justice Department action.

In one phone conversation, according to handwritten notes taken by Donoghue and made public by lawmakers last year, Trump directed to Rosen to “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen.""

Around that time, Trump was introduced by a Republican congressman, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, to Clark, who'd joined the department in 2018 as its chief environmental lawyer and was later appointed to run its civil division. Clark was earlier subpoenaed by the committee to give a deposition but will not be among the witnesses Thursday.

Clark, according to statements from other Justice Department officials, met with Trump despite being ordered not to by bosses at the department and presented himself as eager to aid the president's efforts to challenge the election results. A report released last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee that painted Clark as a relentless advocate for Trump included a draft letter pushing Georgia officials to convene a special legislative session to reconsider the election results.

Clark wanted the letter sent, but superiors at the Justice Department refused.

The Jan. 6 committee played audio of Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, two of Trump’s lawyers, calling state legislators and pressing them to overturn the election.

The situation came to a head on Jan. 3, 2021, a Sunday, when Clark informed Rosen in a private meeting at the Justice Department that Trump wanted to replace him with Clark as acting attorney general. Rosen, according to the Senate report, responded that “there was no universe I could imagine in which that would ever happen"" and that he would not accept being fired by a subordinate.

Rosen then contacted the White House to request a meeting. That night, Rosen, Donoghue and Engel, along with Clark, gathered with Trump and top White House lawyers for a contentious, hours-long Oval Office meeting about whether the president should follow through with his plans for a radical leadership change at the department.

According to testimony given by Rosen, Trump opened the meeting by saying, “One thing we know is you, Rosen, aren’t going to do anything to overturn the election.”

Donoghue and Engel made clear to Trump that they and large numbers of other Justice Department officials would resign if Trump fired Rosen. White House lawyers said the same. Pat Cipollone, then the White House counsel, at one point said the letter that Clark wanted to send was a “murder-suicide pact.”

“Steve Engel at one point said, ‘Jeff Clark will be leading a graveyard. And what are you going to get done with a graveyard,’ that there would be such an exodus of the leadership,” Donoghue told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “So it was very strongly worded to the president that that would happen.”

Donoghue also sought to dissuade Trump from believing that Clark had the legal background to do as the president wished since he was not a criminal prosecutor at the department.

“And he kind of retorted by saying, ‘Well, I’ve done a lot of very complicated appeals and civil litigation, environmental litigation, and things like that,’” Donoghue said. “And I said, ‘That’s right. You’re an environmental lawyer. How about you go back to your office, and we’ll call you when there’s an oil spill.’”",Q2
https://www.fitsnews.com/2022/06/02/south-carolina-gops-ballot-questions-face-scrutiny/,South Carolina GOP’s Ballot Questions Face Scrutiny,"Which special interest is pulling the party’s strings on the 2022 primary ballot?

Every two years, partisan primary elections are held in South Carolina. Democratic and (mostly) Republican voters go to the polls each even-numbered June to decide which candidates they want to represent them in the general election that fall.

As part of that process, both the S.C. Republican Party (SCGOP) and the S.C. Democratic Party (SCDP) are allowed to submit ballot questions – or advisory referendums – for voters to consider as they make their decisions regarding candidates.

Unlike general election referendums, these partisan ballot questions do not carry the force of law. They are merely measures of public opinion. “Advisory questions.”

Why put them on the ballot, then?

Typically, political parties put questions about hot-button issues on the ballot to drive voter turnout. The goal is to give voters who may not have otherwise been inclined to participate in the election a reason to do so. For example, let’s assume the issue of abortion is front-and-center in the public discourse (which, it is). Parties eager to capitalize on voter passion surrounding this issue – either for or against – might put a question related to abortion on the primary ballot as a way of luring voters to the polls.

Parties are allowed to put as many of these questions on the ballot as they choose – and the wording of the questions is left exclusively to party leaders.

In other words, there are literally no rules governing the process …

Election officials have historically warned parties against putting so many questions on the ballot that it “makes (it) multiple pages,” but as of this writing that hasn’t happened.

So … how many questions did the SCGOP submit on this year’s primary ballot? Three.

They are as follows …

Should people have the right to register with the political party of their choice when they register to vote? Should candidates for local school boards be able to run as a candidate of the political party of their choice, just like they do for other elected offices? In a situation where there is more than one person responsible for damages in a lawsuit, do you support changing South Carolina law so that each person should pay damages based on that person’s actual share of fault?

The first two questions are clearly focused on the SCGOP’s ongoing efforts to close partisan primaries in South Carolina. Supporters of a closed primary system argue it would keep these elections “pure” – preventing Democrats and independents from having a say in the selection of GOP nominees.

And vice versa … (ahem).

Opponents argue closed primaries suppress voter turnout, effectively disenfranchising broad swaths of the electorate in violation of the “one person, one vote” principle.

For years, I have argued against closing primaries – believing voters should be able to cast their ballots in whichever primary election floats their boat. In 2016, I even argued that voters in the “First in the South” presidential preference primaries should have been able to vote in both GOP and Democratic elections seeing as these races were held on different days.

It is ridiculous, therefore, for the SCGOP to refer to partisan identification as a “right.” Republican and Democratic voters already have that right. All they have to do is keep voting in their own party primaries.

The third “Republican” question is the most interesting, though … as it seems clear the SCGOP threw it on the ballot at the behest of some special interest.

Which special interest, though?

Regular readers of this news outlet know the issue of tort reform has figured prominently in a high-profile wrongful death case linked to the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.

Mallory Beach, 19, of Hampton, S.C., was killed shortly after 2:00 a.m. EST on February 24, 2019 when a 17-foot, center console fishing boat owned by Alex Murdaugh (the man at the center of this saga) and allegedly driven by his late son, Paul Murdaugh, slammed into the piling of a Beaufort County, S.C. bridge at a high rate of speed.

Paul Murdaugh – who was murdered last spring along with his mother – was “drunker than Cooter Brown” at the time of the crash, to quote his late grandfather.

Beach’s family sued the Murdaughs as well as several of the establishments which either sold or served Paul Murdaugh alcohol on that fateful evening – arguing multiple parties were to blame for the tragedy.

One of those defendants – Parker’s Kitchen – has launched a scorched earth campaign in response to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the company’s founder – Greg Parker – has been wining and dining influential lawmakers in the hopes of convincing them to amend the state’s tort laws.

The SCGOP ballot question certainly sounds right up Parker’s alley … a tool he could use to convince lawmakers to make changes that would benefit his business model.

In a post on her Instagram page, attorney (and former state lawmaker) Mandy Powers Norrell urged GOP voters to “watch out for this non-binding and confusing ballot question.”

“It’s designed to get a ‘yes’ answer, but be careful,” Norrell wrote.

Norrell presented the hypothetical of an 18-year-old with no assets who drove drunk and killed someone. Assuming the victim’s family were to sue both the driver and the store which sold him alcohol, their ability to recover damages would be capped based on the extent to which the blame was apportioned in the case.

In other words, if a jury found the penniless driver ninety percent to blame – the victim’s family could only collect on ten percent of the total verdict from the defendant with deep pockets.

“That’s not fair,” Norrell said. “Under current law, an entity that is the proximate cause of an injury or death – meaning it wouldn’t have happened ‘but for’ their negligence – is liable for the full damages. They can try to collect reimbursement from others at fault. But that responsibility is the at-fault paying party’s, and not the victim’s. Let’s keep it that way.”

While I do further digging on the origin of the GOP ballot question, perhaps the biggest controversy I have uncovered is the failure of the Democratic party to include a single “advisory question” on its ballot.

Why wouldn’t the party want to include a question or two to draw attention (and voters) to its partisan primary elections this spring?

Hmmm …

Stay tuned for much more on that in a future post …

A woman who tracked her boyfriend using Apple AirTag over fears he was cheating followed him to a pub - and ran him over, it is claimed.

Gaylyn Morris, 26, from Indiana, believed boyfriend Andre Smith, 26, was cheating on her and had allegedly drove to an Indianapolis pub three times in the last month to monitor his whereabouts.

According to reports, Morris had confided with witnesses at the pub she was using an Apple AirTag, a tracking device intended to help find lost items, and a GPS, to monitor his movements as she feared Smith was meeting up with another woman.

According to the IndyStar, Morris told the pub witness Smith was cheating on her and at that moment she picked up an empty wine bottle and said to the witness she was going to beat up the woman he was seeing.

Morris was said to have swung the wine bottle at the woman but the boyfriend caught it in-between the two women - as all three were ordered to leave the pub as the row broke out.

Smith, however, stayed in the pub as he was waiting for food but once Morris got outside she allegedly got into her car and waited for him to leave the pub.

According to investigators and witnesses at the scene, she then ploughed into her boyfriend with her car as she clipped him and drove over him multiple times.

A witness told police while outside the bar: ""Morris pulled forward and clipped the victim (Smith), and he went down, at which time… (Morris) then backed over him and then pulled forward and hit him for the third time.""

Morris then allegedly got out of her car and tried to attack the other woman but was immediately detained by police officers.

Emergency services were called to the scene but Indianapolis Fire Department pronounced Andre dead at the scene.

A local coroner also determined he died from intentionally being hit by a vehicle.

It has been lightly edited for today's readers.

DULUTH — For authorities, the case that would become the notorious Glensheen murders began on a warm, muggy summer morning.

ADVERTISEMENT

It was just before 7 a.m. on June 27, 1977, when nurse Mildred Garvue arrived at Glensheen mansion on London Road to start her day shift caring for elderly heiress Elisabeth Congdon, who needed round-the-clock nursing care after suffering a stroke.

To Garvue's surprise, the front door was unlocked. She turned the knob and went in. Across the foyer, on the landing of the grand staircase, she saw Velma Pietila, the night nurse, sprawled on the window seat. Pietila, 67, had retired a month earlier and was filling in for a sick nurse.

For a moment, Garvue thought Pietila had fallen asleep there. But as Garvue mounted the stairs, she came across a bloody scene from a fatal struggle that had started at the top of the stairs on the second floor and continued down to the landing. Pietila had been viciously hit 23 times with a heavy brass candlestick. Most blows were to her head.

Alarmed, Garvue continued on to Congdon's second-floor bedroom. There, she found Congdon in her bed. A satin pillow covering her face had been used to suffocate her.

At 83, Elisabeth Congdon was the last surviving child of Chester Congdon, who made a fortune in mining in the late 1800s and early 1900s. She was the last family member to live in the grand mansion he had built at 3300 London Road.

With no eyewitness or confession, police put together a circumstantial case from a trail of clues left in Duluth; Bloomington, Minn.; and Colorado. News accounts, court documents, trial testimony and the book ""Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings"" reveal how it unfolded:

The police investigation quickly focused on Elisabeth's daughter by adoption, Marjorie Caldwell, 44, and Marjorie's husband, Roger, 43, in a murder-for-inheritance plot. The Caldwells, who had been married a year, lived beyond their means and were deep in debt. At the time of the murders, the couple's financial straits had worsened. Their home, furniture and vehicles had been repossessed, and they were living in a motel in Golden, Colo.

Local SEE ALSO: Glensheen murders still intrigue The case had all the ingredients of an old-fashioned whodunit — wealth, greed, betrayal, even a mansion and a candlestick murder weapon.

Marjorie stood to inherit $8.2 million when her mother died. In the previous 10 years, she had gone through more than $2 million. Her frequent requests for advances on her inheritance and her spendthrift ways had become an irritation for Congdon trustees. A month before the murders, Roger Caldwell traveled to Duluth to ask Congdon trustees for $750,000 so the couple could buy a horse-breeding ranch. He brought a bogus letter from a doctor claiming the Caldwells needed to live on a ranch for Marjorie's youngest son's health.

They didn't get the money. They also didn't get the $250,000 Roger Caldwell asked for just 10 days before the deaths to hire attorney F. Lee Bailey to ward off criminal charges against them. The couple were under investigation for insurance fraud. Marjorie was suspected of arson fires at a Colorado bank that had denied her loans. Roger had bounced checks and fraudulently used credit cards. And Marjorie had been sued several times.

Tightening time frame

At Glensheen, an intruder had apparently broken a basement window to gain entry on the night of the killings and gone up the main staircase, where he encountered Pietila during her 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift . A nylon stocking wrapped around one of her wrists suggested the intruder had tried to tie her wrists. But she fought back and was viciously beaten to death. The murderer cleaned up in the nurse's room across the hall from Elisabeth's room. He took a small wicker suitcase and jewelry from Elisabeth's room, including the watch and ring that Elisabeth was wearing. He left through the front door and drove to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in Pietila's car.

The maid and cook who lived at one end of the house heard nothing, though the cook's dog began barking at 2:50 a.m. and remained agitated for two hours. Pietila's wristwatch stopped at 2:40 a.m, the possible time of her murder.

At the Twin Cities airport a few hours later, car keys with Pietila's name on the key ring were found in a trash receptacle. A parking lot ticket stamped 6:35 a.m. that day also was found in the container. A while later, Pietila's car was located in the short-term lot.

Meanwhile, Roger Caldwell wasn't seen coming or going from his motel room in Golden, Colo., but Marjorie was. She was looking at real estate and giving differing accounts of her husband's whereabouts. After being informed of her mother's death on June 27, she looked at more real estate.

The next day, Roger Caldwell was back in Colorado, opening a safe deposit box at a bank in Golden, looking agitated and with disheveled hair. He had two cuts on his face and a swollen hand, injuries he didn't have two days earlier. With a search warrant, police later found a notarized letter in the safe deposit box that had been signed by Marjorie Caldwell three days before the murders. It irrevocably gave Roger Caldwell a $2.5 million cut of her inheritance upon the death of her mother.

John DeSanto, the assistant St. Louis County attorney who prosecuted the murder cases against the Caldwells, called it the closest thing to a murder contract he's ever had.

The Caldwells returned to Duluth for Elisabeth Caldwell's June 30 funeral, staying at the downtown Radisson Hotel. After they checked out that day, police searched it and found a receipt for a $54.86 purchase from a Twin Cities airport gift shop on the day of the murder. Gift shop clerks said it was for the purchase of a garment bag made at 6:40 a.m. by a man matching Roger Caldwell's description.

After leaving Duluth the day of the funeral, the Caldwells traveled to the Twin Cities, where they stayed at a Bloomington hotel. There, Roger Caldwell collapsed and was taken to a hospital where a high level of sedatives was found in his system. The sedatives were similar to those found in an unresponsive Elisabeth Congdon three years earlier after Marjorie fed her mother a sandwich made with her homemade marmalade. Elisabeth survived, and the incident wasn't pursued after the sandwich and suspect marmalade couldn't be found.

While Roger Caldwell was recovering in the hospital, police searched the couple's Bloomington hotel room. They found the garment bag purchased at the airport. They also found the small wicker suitcase and 25 pieces of jewelry taken from Elisabeth Congdon's room, including the watch and diamond and sapphire ring she had been wearing. Marjorie had long admired and wanted that ring. She told police the jewelry wasn't stolen, but were copies of her mother's jewelry.

Meanwhile, a handwritten envelope addressed to Roger Caldwell arrived at their Colorado motel, postmarked in Duluth on the day of the homicides. The motel clerk gave it to police. Inside was a 1,700-year-old Byzantine coin taken from a memorabilia case in Elisabeth Congdon's bedroom. Handwriting experts concluded Caldwell - who had a coin collection - had addressed the envelope.

Hair and blood found near the dead bodies were ""consistent with"" Roger Caldwell's hair and blood type, the closest match possible in the 1970s. Today, DNA analysis can positively identify blood, hair, saliva, hair and other biological material to connect a suspect to a crime. The defense would argue at trial that the hair was left during Roger's previous visit to the house. But he hadn't been in that part of the house, the prosecution would counter. Police never found Caldwell's fingerprints in the house, leading police to conclude he wore gloves.

One conviction, one acquittal

Nine days after the slayings, Roger Caldwell was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder. He was found guilty in a 1978 trial that was moved to Brainerd because of pretrial publicity. He was sentenced to two life terms. The next day, Marjorie was charged with murder conspiracy and aiding and abetting murder. In her 1979 trial held in Hastings, Minn., she was found innocent of all charges. Jurors apparently liked the chatty, outgoing heiress, because they partied with her after the verdict.

The Caldwells were represented by high-powered defense attorneys from the Twin Cities - Ron Meshbesher for Marjorie and Doug Thomson for Roger - who attacked police procedures, argued the crime scene was contaminated and claimed the Caldwells were framed. Neither Marjorie nor Roger testified at their trials.

Police had made mistakes.

Too many people were allowed access to the crime scene, especially on the first day. There were lapses. Officers discarded cigarette butts in the toilet in the nurse's bathroom where the murderer had cleaned up. A palm print on the sink turned out to belong to the lead police investigator. And a dog was allowed to jump through the apparent entry window to follow a scent.

Duluth police procedures improved as a result. Fewer people are now allowed at crime scenes. Detectives are apt to keep their hands in their pockets or wear gloves when they survey a crime scene. Officers write reports on every lead pursued and interview completed even if nothing relevant results. And photos, fingerprints and other evidence are better documented.

During Marjorie's trial, a key piece of evidence that helped convict Roger was discredited. A fingerprint on the envelope containing the stolen coin that was mailed from Duluth turned out not be Roger's, as earlier believed. It was important evidence because it placed Caldwell in Duluth on the day of the murders.

Because of the fingerprint revelation, the Minnesota Supreme Court threw out Roger's conviction in 1982 and sent the case back to Duluth for a new trial.

That led to the controversial 1983 plea bargain that freed Roger after five years served. In exchange for guilty pleas to two counts of second-degree murder and a confession, he got no additional prison time. His confession, however, yielded no new information. He failed to implicate Marjorie or a possible third conspirator. He said he went to the Congdon mansion to steal, not kill and that he acted alone.

DeSanto has long regretted the deal, which he agreed to because he feared losing a retrial. Instead of accepting the plea, he says he should have walked away and tried the case again.

""I don't think Roger did this alone,"" DeSanto said. ""I believe he met an accomplice in Duluth that helped him. ... The purpose was to murder Elisabeth Congdon for the inheritance. They didn't want to kill Velma, but she fought to her death. I think they were going to tie her up.""

He also thinks they may have had a key to get into the house and that the broken window was a ruse to make it look like a break-in.

The case lacked evidence that clearly placed Roger Caldwell in Duluth on the night of the murders. But police had it. A cab driver had picked up a rider at the Greyhound Bus Depot in downtown Duluth between 11:30 p.m. and midnight that night. As directed, he drove the man down London Road, five blocks beyond Glensheen mansion. The cab driver later identified Roger Caldwell from a physical lineup as the rider. But because he had seen a photo of Caldwell in the paper, a judge ruled the identification was tainted and inadmissible.

But the envelope that had been mailed from Duluth containing the stolen coin still held some secrets. Typically, evidence from a case is destroyed after trials and appeals are exhausted. But DeSanto kept some of the evidence from the Caldwell cases, including the envelope.

In 2003, before ""Will to Murder,"" which DeSanto co-authored, was released, DNA testing was done comparing saliva residue on the envelope's seal with a surviving saliva sample from Roger Caldwell. Those results were combined with analysis of blood from the crime scene believed to be the killer's. The results showed a 99.9% chance the saliva and blood came from Roger Caldwell.",Q2
https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2022/05/24/low-pay--rising-caseloads-drive-public-defender-shortage-in-louisville,Louisville public defenders clash with management over union effort,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A shortage of attorneys at the Jefferson County Public Defender's office is driving up caseloads for those who remain on the job, making it increasingly difficult to provide clients the representation they are constitutionally guaranteed, according to attorneys in the office who have unionized to improve conditions. But that unionization effort has hit a roadblock with management.

What You Need To Know Attorneys in the Jefferson County Public Defender office voted to unionize this year Management ""refuses"" to bargain, an attorney for the union said



The executive director of the office said he has concerns over the ethics of unionization



The union effort was driven by concerns over low pay, rising caseloads and staffing shortages

In January, by a vote of 32 to 5, attorneys in the office formed the Louisville Metro Public Defender’s Union, citing “untenable working conditions.” But for months, management has “refused to bargain with the union,” said Ben Basil, general counsel with the IBEW Local 369, the union with which the public defenders have organized.

“They refuse to provide us any information,” Basil said. “They refuse to do any of the things that they’re obligated to do under federal law.”

A National Labor Relations Board complaint filed against the public defender’s office last week supports Basil’s claim. Management in the office “has been failing and refusing to bargain collectively and in good faith with the exclusive collective-bargaining representatives of its employees,” the complaint says.

Leo Smith, executive director of the public defender’s office, explained the situation differently in a Metro Council Budget Committee hearing Monday.

“Contrary to what has been said, I am not opposed to unions,” he said. But Smith added that there are concerns over whether it is ethical for lawyers in the public defender’s office to unionize. To settle that question, Smith said his office is waiting on a ruling from the Kentucky Bar Association, which will then be taken to the Kentucky Supreme Court.

Once the public defender’s office receives the final ruling, Smith said, “we will proceed accordingly with the definitive guidance of the court.”

Basil said there is no ruling necessary. “There is no prohibition,” he said. “And there are union lawyers all over the country, including in Louisville right now.”

A ‘crisis’ in the courtroom

Despite their dispute over what’s holding back the union effort, attorneys and management in the public defender’s office agree on many of the issues it faces.

Most pressing is the low salary for attorneys working in the office. The starting annual salary is $45,000, which Smith said is so low that it prevents attorneys from seeking jobs as public defenders and makes it more difficult to keep those who work there.

The hours are also long. Smith said the expectation is that attorneys work 60 hours a week, meaning an attorney making the office’s starting wage earns $14.42 per hour.

This information is known to would-be public defenders and prevents them from joining the office, said Metro Councilwoman Cassie Chambers Armstrong, who is also a professor at UofL’s law school.

“Salary and caseloads are really creating this crisis,” she said. “It’s making it so that bright young people who really want to make a difference, do criminal defense, do it for folks who can’t afford attorneys, either aren’t going into the field or aren’t staying there once they’re in.”

Smith said the office has 78 positions, but only 53 are currently filled. That’s resulted in an average caseload of roughly 110 clients per attorney, with some handling significantly more and some, particularly those who work on death penalty cases, handling fewer. The union claims the number is much higher, tweeting last month that case numbers range from 350 to 200 per attorney.

“It is [the] hope that the increases in funding will allow our office to improve employee salaries which would help staff attrition and in turn reduce caseloads,” Smith told Metro Council.

These problems are not unique to Louisville. In December, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that underpaid public defenders are resigning all across Kentucky, leaving the system in crisis. Over the years, the American Bar Association has released a series of reports on the public defender shortages across the nation, from New Mexico to Louisiana, and Oregon to Rhode Island.

The result is a legal system that may fail to provide suspects with the defense they deserve. “The public defender’s job is to represent indigent people, the most vulnerable people in our community,” Basil said. “To the extent that a lawyer is overwhelmed with 200 or 300 cases, that obviously doesn’t serve the client very well.”

Basil added these people are all innocent until proven guilty and public defenders are an essential part of “keeping the system honest, to make sure that police and prosecutors follow the law, that they get their evidence legally, and that they get the right person.”

It is increasingly common for the people charged with upholding that constitutional guarantee to turn to organizing their offices. In April 2020, the American Bar Association reported that unionization among public defenders was on the rise. Cities such as Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania have seen their public defenders move toward unionization.",Q2

We are familiar with the lawn watering restrictions that often go into effect in the summer months. But we never thought about these restrictions.

In Sioux Falls it is against the law to use the hose on your house to spray wash sidewalks, driveway, your car, or the building itself. In other words, do try to be like every shop owner in every movie set in New York City.

After reading the ordinance it makes sense. The basic idea seems to be to deter people from doing things that leave the hose running. The rules say you clean your car or your driveway with a bucket, but don't just turn on the spigot and let gallons of the precious wet stuff flow away.

City Of Sioux Falls Code Of Ordinances states: § 52.002 CERTAIN USES OF WATER DETERMINED NONESSENTIAL – The following uses of water are hereby determined to be nonessential and are hereby prohibited:

(a) Washing outdoor surfaces. The washing of sidewalks, driveways, filling station aprons, porches, and other outdoor surfaces except by container not exceeding three-gallon capacity or pursuant to an exception granted under § 52.009;

(b) Washing mobile equipment. The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, trailer houses, railroad cars or any other type of mobile equipment except where required by health and sanitary requirements and except from water contained in a container not exceeding three-gallon capacity or from a hose equipped with an automatic shutoff device at the end from which water is taken. This division (b) shall not apply to commercial vehicle washing facilities operating at fixed locations;

(c) Cleaning buildings. The washing by hose of the inside and outside of dwellings and buildings except pursuant to an exception granted under § 52.009;

But it's not the first time — positions taken by both sides of the abortion debate have ebbed and flowed repeatedly in the 49 years since the Supreme Court declared abortion a constitutional right.

Abortion opponents and those supporting abortion rights expect the Supreme Court to soon overturn its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, and both groups have reacted strongly. Abortion rights supporters unsuccessfully pushed Congress to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, which would not only codify abortion rights but also eliminate lots of popular restrictions the court has allowed since 1973, most notably parental involvement laws.

But it's abortion opponents' efforts in many conservative states to exclude most exceptions — for rape or incest or to save the life of the mother — that have drawn headlines recently.

The efforts do not appear to have wide appeal. The majorities of Americans who support allowing those exceptions are nearly as large as the majorities who oppose abortion late in pregnancy, according to opinion polls.

Nonetheless, there are numerous examples of such efforts — going far beyond the banning of abortions after 15 weeks, which is at the crux of the Mississippi law being considered by the Supreme Court. A leaked draft opinion published last month suggests the court could use the case to overturn Roe. For example, over the past few months, Oklahoma has passed three laws restricting abortion. The latest one, signed by the governor May 25, bans abortion beginning at fertilization, which would, at least in theory, ban both in vitro fertilization and many forms of hormonal birth control. (The Oklahoma bill's sponsor says that is not the law's intent.)

During debate in the Oklahoma Senate on the strictest of the bans, Republican Sen. Warren Hamilton said he did not think the measure went far enough because it allowed abortions in the case of an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening medical emergency in which an embryo is growing outside the uterus.

That has horrified some medical professionals. ""The fallopian tube and other places a pregnancy can implant cannot support a pregnancy,"" Dr. Iman Alsaden, an OB-GYN and medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, told reporters at a news conference May 19. ""If you continue to let these pregnancies happen, there will be no viable baby afterwards. What will happen is [the fallopian tube] will burst and people will bleed to death.""

At the same time, an increasing number of state legislatures are contemplating bans that do not include exceptions for the health (as opposed to the life) of the pregnant person or for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Testifying on her bill in Ohio, GOP state Rep. Jean Schmidt in April told lawmakers that a child resulting from rape would be ""an opportunity for that woman, no matter how young or old she is, to make a determination about what she's going to do to help that life be a productive human being.""

Rape and incest exceptions have been an accepted part of most abortion bans since the early 1990s, but that was not always the case. For a dozen years, they were not part of the so-called Hyde Amendment, the provision inserted in annual federal spending bills that bars the use of almost all federal funds for abortion.

The more liberal (at least on abortion) Senate tried to keep the rape and incest (and health) exceptions intact back then, only to be forced to back off by the more conservative House, whose anti-abortion efforts were led by Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.). ""The Supreme Court had said: 'You may not impose capital punishment on a rapist. That's cruel and unusual punishment,'"" Hyde said during a 1988 debate over the issue. ""But you are saying exterminate. Exterminate this innocently inconvenient residual of the rape.""

In 1993, Hyde himself put the rape and incest exceptions back into his eponymous funding ban, and they have remained there since. With Democratic president Bill Clinton in the White House, and large Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate, ""I didn't think the votes were there anymore for a straight ban on abortion funding,"" he said at the time. Indeed, at that point, the entire ban was in danger of being dropped, and only Hyde's parliamentary maneuvering kept the slightly less stringent ban in place.

Abortion bans with few or no exceptions are politically risky. In the 2012 Missouri race for U.S. Senate, the challenger, Republican then-Rep. Todd Akin, was favored to defeat incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill until he said in a now-infamous interview that he didn't support exceptions because women rarely get pregnant as a result of rape. ""The female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,"" he said. The comments were disavowed by the Republican running for president that year, Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Paul Ryan. Akin eventually lost.

Now, however, anti-abortion forces appear to be on the cusp of being granted free rein by the Supreme Court to ban abortion to any degree they want. Activists clearly want the most comprehensive bans that lawmakers will pass. Whether voters will go along with that will be decided at the ballot box in November.

Five people are dead after a man went on a shooting rampage at a hotel before carjacking and assaulting another victim then barricading himself into a convenience store.

Harrison County Coroner Brian Switzer has identified the suspect in the incident, which happened in Biloxi, Mississippi, as 32-year-old Jeremy Alesunder Reynolds.

Fawad Chaudhry said that the government thought that they would get money from Saudi Arabia and the United States, but since the world traditionally cared for public reaction and they saw that the people had stood behind Imran Khan, they refused to support the government. He said in contrast when Imran Khan went to Saudi Arabia, China and other countries they had supported him.

The former information minister said that the current government had entered the most expensive LNG contracts and forex reserves were falling rapidly but there was no SPB governor to control the situation. “Punjab where 66% population of the country lived has no government,” he said adding that there is no water for Kharif crops and DAP price had gone up by Rs500 or Rs700 in the past few weeks.

Fawad claimed that there was no crisis in Pakistan and the country was going to stability when the Imran Khan government was removed. He said that the PTI feared that the current rulers would turn Pakistan into Sri Lanka. “Our worst opponents are also saying that the only way forward is to hold fresh elections.”

Due to this situation an administrative crisis has been created in addition to the political crisis which already existed, he said.

Speaking about PTI rally in Sialkot, Fawad Chaudhry said that it was wrong to claim that PTI was holding the rally on the land owned by the Presbyterian Church and PTI MNAs Sunila Ruth would testify to this.

He claimed that PML-N’s Khawaja Asif had held a rally at the same venue four weeks ago while Rana Sanaullah, under the previous PML-N government, had encroached on the church land and set up illegal settlements there.

He said the current government used the religion card against the opposition after the Masjid-e-Nabwi incident and in Sialkot, it has again used the religion card.

He said that arrests cannot stop the PTI’s movement and holding fresh election was the only way possible.

Former Sindh governor Imran Ismail warned that if the government disrupted any of PTI rallies the party would not spare anyone.

He said that on a single cue from Imran Khan there would be fire everywhere, but the PTI chief was observing restraint.

Ismail said that those who had supported the PML-N were regretting their decision and there was division in the PML-N as Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz favored early elections.",Q2
http://www.travelmarketreport.com/Destinations/articles/Japan-Says-Its-Reopening-But-Not-to-Travelers-Just-Yet,"Japan Says It’s Reopening, But Not to Travelers Just Yet","Japan on Wednesday announced that it was lifting its COVID-19 entry ban for 106 countries, a list that includes the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and more.

The news is the first time Japan moved towards a reopening since closing its borders at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. However, despite some headlines, the news does not mean that travelers will be able to enter the country.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, the “reopening” is only for “foreign nationals” who are entering “into Japan under the supervision of receiving organizations.” The reopening, the Ministry said, is not for those traveling “for touristic purposes.”

Currently, there is no timeline for allowing inbound international travelers to enter Japan, which remains one of the last remaining major international destinations to stay closed to tourists. Other countries to reopen, or drop remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions, recently include Canada, Sweden, New Zealand, the U.K., and more.

Koichi Wada, the commissioner of the official Japan Tourism Agency, told the country’s parliament last month that it’s “difficult” to forecast the future of its inbound tourism.

https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/20186817.muslims-hold-silent-protest-provocative-film/,Silent protest held against ‘provocative’ film,"British made, The Lady of Heaven is directed by Eli King and written by cleric Yasser Al-Habib. Filming began in 2019 and the production was delayed due to the Covid pandemic.

It has now been released nationwide including towns with high Muslim populations such as Blackburn, Bradford and Manchester through mainstream cinema chains such as Vue, Cineworld and Showcase.

Protests had also been planned in other towns and cities where local Muslims are concerned the storyline ‘negatively depicts’ deeply loved Islamic religious figures and goes against well-known historic facts.

About 25 people turned up outside Vue Cinemas in Blackburn last night (Friday June 2) after 6pm to hold a silent protest. None of the group were holding banners but simply wanted to know their feelings known to the cinema chain.

When approached, managers at the cinema would not comment whether the film had been pulled but did say it was no longer listed on their website. They said an official comment would be sent out after the weekend.

There were suggestions that someone had brought 'dozens of tickets' and was distributing them in the car park earlier.

Later, a spokesperson for the group of demonstrators, which was not affiliated to any one group, said the film would not be showing and ‘had been pulled’.

The independent film has already garnered a great deal of controversy in the build up to its release and has been banned in shia majority nation Iran, where it was believed it may cause ‘divisions among Muslims’. Other countries such as Pakistan, which called it ‘sacrilegious’ and Egypt have also followed suit in banning the movie.

Some Shia scholars have also condemned the storyline due to its 'historical inaccuracies'.

The Lady of Heaven was released on June 3 in cinemas in the UK

The plot revolves around Laith, an Iraqi child in the middle of a war-torn country after losing his mother, has found himself a new home with an elderly woman who tells him the story of Fatima, whose face is never shown, the daughter of Muhammad.

The Prophet Muhammad’s face is a mixture of computer generated and lighting imagery. The film said holy personalities were not represented by ‘any one individual’ and were made up of computer-generated images.

Critics say it also looks to liken an ISIS assault on a woman to that of an inaccurate story of how two of the Prophet’s closet companions were responsible for an assault on his daughter Fatima to the fourth caliph Ali, who is revered highly by both Shias and Sunnis.

Other critics have said the depictions of caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, the wife of the Prophet, Aisha and other negative characters were black as this ‘stems from the racial bias against darker skinned people’.

Roshan Muhammed Salih of 5 Pillars has been a vocal critic of the film had watched the movie.

He felt, ‘there is no doubt that Lady of Heaven is going to create sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shias in the UK’.

He adds: ‘Lady of Heaven is two hours plus of the most extreme Shia sectarian narratives about how the caliphate was supposedly “usurped” from the Ahl ul Bayt. And most Muslims will find the invective against three of the most beloved companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) shocking and disgusting.’

He admitted there had been calls from some Shia spokespersons to distance themselves from this movie and also urged ‘all mainstream Sunni scholars to reject this story as a complete lie.’

A New York Times review says the film is hardly about Fatima, whose face is shrouded throughout, whilst The Guardian says 'for a film that aims to promote religious diversity and freedom of thought, its metronomic alternation between time frames, narrative slavishness and laughable coda have a suffocating sense of orthodoxy.'",Q2

Attorney General Letitia James and several lawmakers on Monday announced proposed legislation to create The Reproductive Freedom and Equity Program, which would bolster financial support for abortion providers and nonprofit organizations to increase their capacity in anticipation of future demand for care.

“New York must lead the fight to keep abortion safe and accessible for all who seek it,” James said Monday.

The legislation comes after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court, made public earlier this month, showed the court seemed poised to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which established a constitutional right to abortion.

A draft opinion does not reflect the court’s final decision, but national protections for abortion would be significantly rolled back if the court officially overturns the 1973 decision later this year.

Several states recently tightened their abortion laws, including Texas, which banned abortion after six weeks last fall, and Florida, where most abortions after 15 weeks will be outlawed come July 1. A similar ban in Mississippi is before the Supreme Court.

Twenty-six states have laws indicating that they’d ban abortions in most cases if Roe is overturned or weakened, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.

More on abortion in NY:Roe v. Wade may be overturned. Here's what that means for New York

More on Supreme Court leak:Explosive leaked draft in abortion case reveals Supreme Court on verge of overturning Roe

What would the legislation do?

The Reproductive Freedom and Equity Program in New York would:

Provide funding for abortion providers and non-profit organizations

Provide funding for uncompensated and uninsured abortion care, supporting access to abortion for low-income New Yorkers

Support people coming to New York for the procedure from other states that ban abortion

In 2019, 9% of all abortion procedures performed in New York – about 7,000 out of a total 79,000 that year – were for people from out of state, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If Roe v. Wade is overturned, that number is likely to increase to more than 32,000 procedures a year, just for individuals traveling from Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

By contrast, only 3% of 104,370 abortions performed in New York in 2012 were out-of-state residents, federal data show.

Other abortion-related legislation proposed in the state Senate earlier this year included a measure to create an abortion access fund, and another to issue further legal protections for abortion providers in New York.

“There has never been a more urgent time to pass my bill to support abortion access funds in New York,” wrote Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, D-Bronx, on Twitter following the Supreme Court leak.

This is America: Experts say abortion bans will impact people of color the most

What abortion protections does NY already have?

New York codified Roe v. Wade into state law in 2019, via the Reproductive Health Act.

That law allows abortions up to 24 weeks, saying one can be performed in New York if ""the patient is within twenty-four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health.""

Gov. Kathy Hochul and other prominent New York officials championed New York’s protections in light of the Supreme Court’s draft opinion, signaling that New York would fight for abortion rights and open its doors to those from other states who are seeking abortions.

""For anyone who needs access to care, our state will welcome you with open arms,” Hochul said in a statement last week. “New York will always be a place where abortion rights are protected and where abortion is safe and accessible.”

Amid the politically charged debate, the number of abortions nationally has fallen to the lowest level since the procedure became legal in 1973, according to federal data and advocacy groups on both sides of the issue.

For example, national surveying reported a total 629,898 abortions in 2019, reflecting a nearly 10% decline from 2012, the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show.

Americans United for Life, a national legal firm opposed to abortion, has contended legal reforms and advocacy have contributed to a more than 50% drop in the abortion rate since the 1980s.

Meanwhile, some groups, such as the Guttmacher Institute, have asserted the declines in abortions nationally were due to a decrease in pregnancies rather than tighter restrictions on abortion.

A man has been given a payout of over £345,000 ($450,000) after he was given a surprise birthday party at work that led to him having a panic attack.

Kevin Berling, 29, was a lab technician at Gravity Diagnostics, in Covington, Kentucky, when he was given an unexpected birthday party in August, 2019.

But rather than it being a fun occasion for Mr Berling, he suffered a panic attack from all the focus on him from the other workers, it is reported.

And it went from bad to worse, claimed Mr Berling’s lawyer Tony Bucher who said that he was afterwards treated badly by the company bosses before being fired.

Mr Berling then went on to claim for compensation.

“Managers started giving him a hard time for his response to the birthday celebrations,” Berling’s attorney, Tony Bucher, told local TV news outlet WKRC. “They actually accused him of stealing his co-workers’ joy.”

It is alleged that Berling had also told the office manager when he joined the company in 2018 that he did not want any birthday parties for him but that his boss “forgot” this.

Then when the party took place, Berling left the building and spent an hour in his car where he tried to recover from the panic attack.

The following day he suffered another panic attack when his bosses questioned him over his behaviour, reported the New York Post.

And a week later he was reportedly sacked on the grounds that they were “worried about him being angry and possibly becoming violent.”

The hefty payout also took into account the massive growth of Gravity Diagnostics’ during the Covid pandemic when some of the employees received 300% pay increases.

Mr Bearing took his case for compensation over lost income and damages to Kenton County court.

A 12-person jury unanimously awarded Berling a $450,000 judgement against the company last Friday.

The amount covered $120,000 in lost wages and benefits, $30,000 in future wages, and $300,000 for “past, present and future mental pain and suffering, mental anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, mortification, and loss of self-esteem,” according to the court’s judgment in Berling’s favor.",Q2

The decision struck down a century-old New York law requiring people to demonstrate a self-defense need when applying for a concealed-carry permit. Legal scholars say the decision will have ripple effects on gun-control policies nationwide.



Pierre Atlas, senior lecturer in the Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IUPUI, said Hoosiers are unlikely to directly feel those effects.



""I would say, though, that the logic of the ruling, and what they say about the Second Amendment in general, could have an effect in Indiana in terms of any other current gun laws or any gun laws that might be put on the books in the future,"" Atlas emphasized.



Atlas pointed out the court's ruling essentially reinforces Indiana's approach to gun permitting and gun control. Indiana's current policies are known as ""shall-issue"" laws, where the burden of proof to deny a gun license is on the state. New York's now-defunct law was a ""may-issue"" policy, which shifts the burden onto the citizen to prove they need the firearm.



For as many gun-control doors as it closes, Atlas argued the court's majority decision also opens a few paths. Penned by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, the decision noted there were laws in the mid-19th century dictating ""individuals could not carry deadly weapons in a manner likely to terrorize others.""



""Imagine today maybe somebody coming up with a law saying you're not allowed to carry a firearm openly in a way that terrorizes others,"" Atlas posed. ""That might be used perhaps to reduce open-carry of AR-15s, which you could say could be used to terrorize others.""



Indiana is poised to enact a new law Friday to eliminate the need for a handgun permit, which Atlas observed will trade out the state's current ""shall-issue"" approach to handguns for an even looser gun control policy.



The law has been criticized by law enforcement and gun-safety groups, who contended it removes an important safety barrier to keep firearms away from people who shouldn't have them.

Support for Governor Tony Evers's first statewide Office of Violence Prevention is gaining momentum, as some safety experts and advocates say they're hopeful it'll save lives. Reggie Moore heads community safety at the Medical College of Wisconsin. He formerly led Milwaukee's violence prevention office during a critical period following a 70-percent increase in homicides in 2015. He believes people understand the intent and potential for offices like these.



""The fact that cities are getting smarter on crime and the impact that these types of interventions can have in addressing violence before it happens, I think is something that people understand that we should be doing.""



He says that starts with a public health approach to preventing gun violence. It's that approach, he adds, that contributed to Milwaukee's four-year decline in homicides and nonfatal shootings beginning in 2016. He adds that was one of the biggest declines in the country at the time.



While violence prevention offices are not new, larger investments in them are. Moore says in 2016, when he started leading the Milwaukee office, few existed. Now, he says there are more than seventy across the country. Moore says the historic levels of federal investments is promising, since law enforcement can't and shouldn't do this work alone.





""For hundreds of years the country has taken a criminal justice approach solely to this issue, but understanding the fact that this is also a public health crisis, and hearing the governor declare this the year of the kid, I think it's timely given the fact that since 2020 gun violence has become the leading cause of death of children.""



Earlier this month, Governor Evers announced he's directing 10-million dollars to the Office of Violence Prevention. The funds are from the American Rescue Plan Act and will provide grants to school districts, law enforcement agencies and nonprofits to help reduce gun violence. It's still unclear whether the Trump administration will impact federal funds for programs like these.

President Donald Trump has been busy signing executive orders since his inauguration.



Gun violence prevention advocates in Minnesota hope he isn't aggressive in undoing recent work to keep communities safer.



The White House website for the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created under the Biden administration, recently went dark.



Staffers insist sudden online changes are a formality as they retool under new leadership, hinting that landing pages for key topics will be restored.



But Maggiy Emery, executive director of the group Protect Minnesota, said she doesn't feel reassured much of the office's mission will be maintained.



""We were finally seeing some of those rates of gun violence go down,"" said Emery, ""you know, especially here in Minnesota.""



Gun violence deaths in Minnesota were down 5% in 2023, the last year for available numbers.



And the national Brady organization credits the Office of Gun Violence Prevention for supporting the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms in shutting down more than 800 rogue gun dealers in the U.S.



While the future is uncertain for this White House initiative, Trump has dismantled a new school safety committee that included parents of school shooting victims.



Trump administration officials say they want to prioritize national security matters.



But Emery said despite recent progress, gun violence is still a public health crisis in the U.S.



She added that the initiative under President Joe Biden was bringing to light how rural areas affected.



""We know that the Office of Violence Prevention on the federal level was looking at what can we do to reduce rates of gun violence,"" said Emery, ""not only in urban areas, but in rural areas where folks are really the most impacted in Minnesota. You know, guidances and legislation around safe storage is now looking more unlikely.""



More than 70% of gun deaths in Minnesota are from suicides, and Emery said most are in rural areas.



If federal solutions fall by the wayside, she said she hopes Minnesota lawmakers pass a state law for safe gun storage this year.



In Trump's first term, bump stocks - the rapid-fire gun accessories - were banned. However, the U.S. Supreme Court later struck down that order.

(ThyBlackMan.com) When the Supreme Court overturned Section Five of the Voting Rights Act, it struck a blow to voting rights. No longer did states with a history of discrimination have to submit their plans to make electoral changes to the department of Justice. Instead, voters and advocacy organizations that experienced limitations of their rights had to go to court to prove that discrimination. Though this placed a burden on voting rights advocates, litigators, and the Transformative Justice Coalition’s, Barbara Arnwine has gone from state to state fighting unequal, discriminatory voting laws and voter suppression. TJC first produced its Map of Shame in 2016, focusing on ways states change voting laws to keep voter turnout down. The 45th President’s narrow victory over Hilary Rodham Clinton was partly a function of low voter turnout and a flawed Clinton campaign, and it was also a function of voter suppression. Voting rights activists and volunteers ensured President Biden’s victory in 2020, and the result has been a more aggressive attempt to curtail voting rights. In Georgia, it is even illegal to offer a bottle of water to someone standing in line for hours on a hot day! The effects of these curtailed rights will be seen in the 2022 midterm and 2024 Presidential elections unless people push back with the same intensity as they did in 2020.

Just as our voting rights are disappearing, so also are women’s rights to comprehensive health care. Someone leaked a draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. In 2018 Mississippi passed the Gestational Age Act, which banned abortion after 15 weeks. The Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only licensed abortion clinic in Mississippi, filed a lawsuit in federal court and requested a temporary restraining order to prevent lawmakers from enforcing the law. The restraining order was granted, so the State Health Officer, Thomas Dobbs, took the case to the Supreme Court. The Court is likely to overturn Roe v. Wade and decide that Mississippi’s abortion restriction is constitutional.

The court wants to go even further than that. In the leaked opinion, Justice Alito wrote, “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled.” He and four other conservative justices – Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett- have been planning this moment since the 45th President appointed them to the court. Arguably Gorsuch and Kavanaugh could be charged with perjury and tried for lying under oath to the United States Senate as both of them acknowledged the precedent of Roe and pledged to honor its precedent. In reacting to the May 1 leak, Chief Justice John Roberts described it as a “singular and egregious breach of trust that is an effort to the Court and the community of public servants who work here.” The first breach of trust came when Gorsuch and Kavanaugh lied under oath. It is profoundly hypocritical for Roberts to speak of trust when defending liars.

Poor women and women of color are most likely to be impacted if Roe is overturned. Women outside Jackson now have to drive hundreds of miles to get to Mississippi’s only abortion provider. In addition to the fee for abortion services, women may need to finance transportation, an overnight stay, and more. Wealthy women will get what they want, no matter what the law. Before Roe, these women went to Mexico or found their way around the law. Poor women have no such options.

Restricting the right to comprehensive health care also constrains women’s economic self-sufficiency. Research shows that the availability of contraception increases women’s labor force participation, which is good for the economy. Now some conservatives are considering restricting access to contraception. But contraception makes women’s investment in education and employment more likely. Emboldened by the many ways legislators have chipped away rights guaranteed by Roe and Casey, legislators in Mississippi are proposing laws to declare that life begins at conception, outlawing abortions after “life.” In Louisiana, legislators are proposing laws to define abortion as murder. All of this anti-abortion legislation is an attack on women’s rights.

Most Americans support abortion rights, in many cases with some restrictions. The Supreme Court is tone-deaf to the people’s sentiments and, more importantly, to 50-year precedents. Roe was decided based on privacy rights, which keep the courts out of the bedroom and away from people’s health status. Reversing Roe removes privacy rights, not just the right to choose. What’s next? Marriage equality? Further erosion of voting rights? Interracial marriage? What else?

The difference between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats plan by Presidential cycle, while Republicans plan for decades. This triumph of conservatism has been planned since Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980. Forty years later, hard-fought gains are being lost, and our rights are disappearing. We are moving back to the 1950s or, given our economic situation, perhaps the 1930s, moving backwards as surely as we did when parts of the Voting Rights Act were overturned. People are taking their anger and disappointment to the streets, but maybe a decade too late.

A similar bill was vetoed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards last year. Lawmakers were unable to overturn Edwards' veto in 2021. Edwards hasn't said if he will veto McCormick's bill if it wins final passage as expected.

Twenty-five states have enacted similar laws, which supporters describe as ""constitutional carry"" because they believe the U.S. Constitution already grants people the right to possess concealed guns.

Louisiana is already what's known as an ""open carry"" state, which means people can carry visible firearms without a permit.

""Louisiana is not stepping into the unknown,"" said Louisiana Shooting Association President Dan Zelenka while testifying in favor of the bill.

Louisiana currently requires someone to buy a $125 permit and complete nine hours of in-person training, which can cost as much as $150, before carrying a concealed gun.

Zelenka said that creates a financial barrier for people who can't afford the permit and training.

Opponents, like those representing the Louisiana Association of Chiefs of Police, warned allowing concealed carry without permits elevates the potential of illegal gun violence or accidental shootings.

""House Bill 37 doesn't promote a culture of life,"" said Tom Constanza, executive director of the Louisiana Conference of Catholic Bishops. ""It removes important and reasonable training safeguards that protect life.""

""The fringe folks who support this don't choose life,"" said Angelle Bradford, a volunteer with Louisiana Moms Demand Action.

McCormick said concealing a gun in a purse or jacket ""isn't going to cause chaos.""

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer asked a Michigan court on Thursday to recognise a right to abortion under the state constitution and overturn a 176-year-old state ban that may take effect if a landmark United States ruling is overturned.

The Democratic governor’s pre-emptive lawsuit, filed in Oakland County against prosecutors in 13 Michigan counties with an abortion clinic, came as the US Supreme Court considers allowing states to ban abortion much earlier in pregnancy and potentially overturning the right.

Planned Parenthood of Michigan and its chief medical officer filed a similar suit in the state Court of Claims to block enforcement of the 1931 law, which dates to an 1846 ban. With the old law still on its books, Michigan is one of 28 US states that would ban or be likely to ban abortions if the US Supreme Court reverses its 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade legalising abortion rights nationwide.

Whitmer was expected to request that the Michigan Supreme Court quickly take her case rather than let it wind through lower trial and appellate courts. A favourable decision in Whitmer’s case would allow abortions to continue in Michigan even if the top federal court reverses Roe v Wade.

“It was important for us to take action now, to ensure that women and providers across the state of Michigan know whether abortions will still be available in the state because it impacts their lives and our healthcare providers’ practices,” Whitmer told The Associated Press, saying nearly 2.2 million women may lose access to a safe, legal medical procedure.

“It’s crucial that we take this action now to secure and ensure that the Michigan Constitution protects this right that we have had available for 49 years,” she said.

Michigan’s unenforced abortion ban was enacted before the 1973 Roe decision that legalised abortion. States on both sides of the abortion issue have been taking a variety of steps to prepare for Roe being eroded or rescinded, including making it a crime to perform an abortion or banning legal action against people who aid or receive an abortion.

Michigan’s law makes it a felony to use an instrument or administer any substance with the intent “to procure the miscarriage” of a woman unless necessary to preserve her life.

Whitmer wants the Michigan Supreme Court to declare a state constitutional right to abortion and to strike down the 1931 law, a near total ban that the governor called “one of the most extreme laws in the country”.

Her lawsuit argues that the law is invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution. Calls to repeal the law have gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature.

Whitmer will ask that the court intervene in part to avoid legal uncertainty when the federal high court issues its ruling on Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

The complaint says that while the Michigan Supreme Court in 1973 ruled that Roe limited the effect of the state ban, the right to abortion has been undermined over 50 years of litigation in federal courts. The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in 1997 that there is no constitutional right to abortion, but the state’s high court has never ruled on the question.

Abortion rights advocates in Michigan have launched a ballot drive to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution,s but need about 425,000 voter signatures to put the initiative up to a vote in November.

Meanwhile, seven Democratic county prosecutors who were named in Whitmer’s lawsuit pledged to not enforce the anti-abortion law. The other six elected prosecutors named are Republicans.

“We cannot and will not support criminalizing reproductive freedom or creating unsafe, untenable situations for healthcare providers and those who seek abortions in our communities,” said a joint statement from the elected prosecutors of Michigan’s Wayne, Oakland, Genesee, Washtenaw, Ingham, Kalamazoo, and Marquette counties.

“Instead, we will continue to dedicate our limited resources towards the prosecution of serious crimes and the pursuit of justice for all.”

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-18/buffalo-latest-mass-shooting-gunman-wearing-body-armor,Buffalo is the latest mass shooting by a gunman wearing body armor,"A police officer stands guard outside the scene of a mass shooting at the Tops supermarket in Buffalo, N.Y.

When a shooter attacked a supermarket in Buffalo, N.Y., over the weekend, its security guard tried to stop him. At least one of the guard’s shots hit the gunman — but it didn’t stop the deadly rampage, because the gunman was wearing body armor.

Ten Black people died in the racist massacre, including security guard Aaron Salter, a retired Buffalo police officer hailed as a hero. It’s the latest mass shooting in which the gunman apparently came prepared for anyone trying to stop him with a gun.

At least 21 mass shooters over the last four decades have worn some kind of body armor — and the majority of those were within the last 10 years, according to a database maintained by the Violence Project, a nonpartisan research group that tracks gun violence.

Among them: a massacre that killed 12 people and injured dozens more at a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012, and another in nearby Boulder that left 10 people dead at a supermarket last year. The shooter in Texas’ deadliest mass slaying was also wearing protective gear when he killed more than two dozen people at a church in 2017, as was a radicalized Islamic couple who carried out a terror attack in San Bernardino in 2015.

“They’re demonstrating this intent that ‘I want to absolutely kill or hurt as many people as I possibly can before I just can’t fight anymore,’” said Chris Burbank, the former police chief of Salt Lake City, who is now with the Center for Policing Equity.

The Violence Project database doesn’t show a clear correlation with body armor and the number of victims. But such gear can enable attackers to shoot longer and is a symbolic way to adhere to societal expectations of what a mass shooting looks like, said James Densley, a criminal justice professor at Metro State University in Minnesota, who co-founded the Violence Project.

“A mass shooting is intended to be a final act — you don’t get away with a mass shooting,” Densley said. “So it’s meant to be a big spectacle, and it’s meant to have people pay attention and to notice it. One of the ways you do that is you dress up pretending you’re in the military.”

Police officers are seeing body armor in other types of investigations, like narcotics cases, said former Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina. Body armor is relatively easy to get, especially the soft body armor similar to the bulletproof vests regularly worn by police officers, which are effective against handguns.

Getting body armor isn’t difficult under U.S. laws. It’s illegal under federal law for a convicted felon to buy body armor, but other than that, there are few restrictions on purchasing it. Only one state blocks it from being ordered online and shipped to homes: Connecticut, which requires a face-to-face purchase.

Colina would like to see more states consider stricter rules.

“I don’t think it’s something that is really thought about too much, but we’ve seen it many times and we’ve seen it here in south Florida,” Colina said. “Somebody commits a crime wearing body armor, and it’s terrifying. The idea that you may not be able to stop them if you had to use deadly force is terrifying.”

Body armor itself isn’t inherently dangerous and is in fact aimed at protection — something on the minds of many people amid a spike in gun violence in the U.S., Burbank said. And it’s unclear what effective body armor regulation would even look like, given the difficulty of regulating the weapons used in the shootings.

“Most of those same laws apply to guns,” Burbank said. “Does that prohibit anyone in this nation from having access to a firearm?”

Body armor hasn’t been worn in the majority of mass shootings, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University who has been tracking mass killings back to 2006 along with the Associated Press and USA Today.

But it does indicate a level of planning. Body armor was mentioned more than a dozen times in the online writings attributed to the white suspect in the Buffalo shooting, Payton Gendron, who was arrested at the supermarket and has pleaded not guilty to murder.

The Violence Project database also doesn’t include slayings that don’t meet the definition of a mass shooting, where fewer than four people are killed.

In one such shooting at Philadelphia’s Thomas Jefferson University Hospital last October, a nursing assistant wearing blue scrubs and a ballistics vest killed a co-worker and then wounded two police officers before being killed himself. In an incident this month in Round Rock, Texas, a 31-year-old Marine veteran wounded a neighbor before engaging in a shootout with law enforcement, after which he was found dead, wearing body armor.

In contrast to U.S. laws, four Canadian provinces have enacted severe restrictions on the possession of body armor: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Nova Scotia. Residents must obtain permits to possess body armor, including ballistic vests, and must undergo background checks before getting those permits, which must be renewed on an annual or biannual basis. Violators face hefty fines and jail time.

Alberta adopted its law in 2012 because of spiraling gang violence in which gang members wore vests while committing crimes, such as drive-by shootings, and even sported them in public, said Ian Roddick, a spokesman with the province’s Ministry of Justice and Solicitor General.

Applicants must have no criminal record. Permits generally are granted to those whose jobs, such as security guards, require protection.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/27/nominal-ways-president-biden-could-expand-abortion-rights/,Can Biden provide abortion on federal lands?,"When it comes to restoring abortion rights in red states after the fall of Roe v. Wade, Democrats don’t have many options other than to urge people who support those rights to vote in November. They have passed a bill in the House protecting abortion rights, but Senate Republicans have blocked the legislation.

And President Biden can’t do much on his own. Of codifying abortion rights into federal law, he said: “No executive action from the president can do that.” On Wednesday Biden did say that he supported carving out an abortion exception to the filibuster; it’s still an unlikely path.

But is there anything he can do around the edges? This month, the White House met with abortion rights and reproductive rights groups to brainstorm possible actions the executive branch can take.

Some possibilities that abortion rights supporters are floating include:

Enable abortions to be performed on federal land in red states: The legal consensus is that it’s theoretically possible to set up an abortion clinic on a military base in, for example, Arkansas. (The Hyde Amendment does prohibits federal funding for most abortions, but it doesn’t necessarily come into play here; the federal government could simply open up its land and invite private doctors to perform the procedures and administer the medication.)

But doing this would be very difficult, and could put women or people who help them or the health care providers at legal risk, including jail time. That’s not a risk the federal government wants to take, according to legal experts.

The main sticking point is that state law can apply in the absence of federal law — and there is no federal law protecting abortion.

Advertisement

That means that a woman who travels to a certain part of Arkansas to get an abortion could later be prosecuted for it by the federal government. (In this scenario, since states don’t have jurisdiction over federal lands, it’s the federal government that would prosecute the abortion seekers and providers for violating state law.) The Biden administration obviously wouldn’t do this, but if a Republican administration takes over in 2025, women could retroactively face punishment for getting an abortion this way.

“You can’t do something unless you can promise doctors and patients that they are not going to face criminal liability,” said Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan who supports abortion rights and is host of the Supreme Courtpodcast “Strict Scrutiny.”

There’s no indication the White House is considering this option. Instead, they are focused on safeguarding a woman’s right to travel from state to state — Mississippi to Michigan, for example — to get an abortion. They’re also focused on ensuring access to federal government-approved pills for medicated abortion that a doctor can prescribe by telemedicine. (More on both those later.)

Declare a public health emergency: This could help government agencies prioritize research around abortion or help put together resources to help people seeking abortions — especially when paired with other authorities they have during emergencies and disasters, said Marya Torrez, the senior policy director at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “The White House also plays a critical role in framing the narrative and treating this like the public health emergency that it is,” she said.

“There is no magic bullet,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra at a recent news conference. “But if there is something we can do, we will find it and we will do it.”

Becerra said he’s already directing agencies he oversees to find more ways to protect patients’ privacy, and for the federal government to take more of an active role in training doctors and other health-care providers to help women seek abortion care.

Make abortion medication easier to access: The federal government has already made it easier for women to get abortion pills by mail or prescribed by telemedicine. And the government doesn’t require that women take them only in clinical settings. But only certain providers can prescribe mifepristone, one of two pills necessary for a medical abortion.

The federal government could change the guidelines to allow any medical provider to write a prescription for this medication and could expand the pharmacies where it can be picked up, said Elizabeth Nash, an abortion law expert with the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights.

Mailed abortion pills became more popular even before the fall of Roe. As The Post’s Caroline Kitchener reports, an Austria-based group that mails abortion pills to all 50 U.S. states said orders from Texas increased by 1,000 percent when that state enacted its six-week ban in the fall. (Overseas pharmacies aren’t beholden to U.S. law.)

The Post reports that some abortion rights advocates are pushing the government to make abortion pills available over the counter but that such a move is unlikely because in some cases, the pills can cause heavy bleeding that requires medical assistance.

Currently, some states are considering banning these pills outright. And the Supreme Court could limit the federal government’s ability to override those state bans, said Litman.

Another problem is that medical abortions usually require several days to terminate a pregnancy. For many women in states that ban abortion, it’s difficult to impossible for them to take that time off work, figure out child care and travel to another state where they can access the medication.

The overturn of Roe v. Wade is bringing more attention to the abortion pill, which has become one of the most accessible methods for abortion. (Video: The Washington Post)

Help with travel to get an abortion: America will be starkly divided between red states that restrict or outlaw abortion and blue states that move to codify abortion protections. The Biden administration could provide grants to those needing an abortion so they can travel to a state where the procedure is legal, or they can help parents with child care. That cost is often a major impediment for women left with only out-of-state options.

Already, the corporate world is considering this. Almost immediately after the Supreme Court announced its decision, Disney said it will cover the cost of employees traveling out of state to get abortions.

But the Biden administration would have to ensure that any such travel grant didn’t violate the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion. (The military provides abortions for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or that would endanger the mother’s life. On Friday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he was reviewing the decision and what it meant for military families stationed in states that restrict abortion rights even further.)

Help people understand abortion law in their states: The post-Roe landscape is confusing. State by state, the rules on where abortion is available and at what stage of a pregnancy are changing. The Biden administration has set up a website to help people navigate all this. But that’s probably as far as the administration can go in helping people obtain abortions, Litman said. She thinks anything further would violate the Hyde Amendment.

A reproductive rights activist — speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss conversations with the White House — said she has urged White House to do a full-court press on how women can access abortion care, like it did while giving advice on covid-19. “There is a huge amount of misinformation out there,” she said, “and the federal government and executive branch can play a critical role in making sure people know how to access care.”

Clarify existing law on when someone can get reported for having an abortion: Nash said that as more people try to perform abortions under the radar, more people may end up in emergency rooms. Federal law does not require medical providers to call police when a patient violates state law by attempting an abortion when it is banned. Health-care workers don’t have to report that, she said, and the Biden administration could make that clear — to both health-care workers and women who might seek medical care after attempting an abortion.

On the other end of the spectrum, the administration is considering warning Americans who use apps to track their menstrual cycles that their data can be used to determine when someone is in the early stages of pregnancy, the New York Times reports.

Consider ways to expand access to other reproductive health care: Specifically, Nash said, the federal government — and state governments — could find ways to expand access to contraception, pregnancy care and sex education, so that women in conservative states who aren’t allowed to have an abortion have more resources.

Here, there could be some room for bipartisan action. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who, like most Republicans, celebrated the fall of Roe, is introducing legislation focused on this. He said in a statement that the government needs to expand the child tax credit for working families. And he wants more federal support to help mothers carry a pregnancy to term: “Expectant mothers — especially those who are surprised by, and unprepared for, pregnancy — require additional support in the form of mentorship, counseling, medical care and more,” he said.

Nominate federal judges that support abortion rights: Along with the confusing legal landscape will come lawsuits — lots of them — and abortion rights activists want judges that will lean their way. Already, you can see the legal debate over state laws bubbling up. In Florida, a judge just blocked the state’s 15-week ban. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) has asked the state’s Supreme Court to invalidate a 1930s law banning abortion in the state. In Ohio, the state’s Republican attorney general is working with the courts to try to reinstate a 2019 law banning abortion at six weeks of pregnancy; liberal groups are challenging it, report The Post’s Annie Linskey and Colby Itkowitz.

Washington, D.C.--(Newsfile Corp. - May 16, 2022) - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained asset freezes and other emergency relief against StraightPath Venture Partners LLC, StraightPath Management LLC, Brian K. Martinsen, Michael A. Castillero, Francine A. Lanaia, and Eric D. Lachow (collectively, the defendants) to halt ongoing securities violations, including allegedly selling pre-initial (IPO) shares they did not own, pocketing undisclosed fees, and commingling investor funds, resulting in Ponzi scheme-like payments. The relief arose from fraud and registration charges filed by the SEC.

The SEC alleges that the defendants, running an unregistered broker-dealer with a vast network of sales agents, raised at least $410 million from more than 2,200 investors from November 2017 through February 2022. The SEC also alleges that the defendants repeatedly told investors that each investment would be kept separate and that they were charging no upfront fees, but the defendants freely commingled investor funds, paid themselves more than $75 million, and paid their sales agents nearly $48 million from illegal, undisclosed markups on the pre-IPO shares that were, in some cases, as high as 100 percent. The SEC alleges that a share deficit exists of at least $14 million across the funds. The defendants also allegedly concealed from investors that two of the three founders, Castillero and Lanaia, ran the funds despite being barred from the brokerage industry. When SEC staff sought copies of the emails sent by the defendants' sales agents during its investigation, rather than producing them, Castillero and Martinsen allegedly deleted them from their servers and texted that“an a***hole regulator would have a field day” with a particular e-mail.

“We allege that the defendants deceived investors about the pre-IPO shares they held, how much they were charging in fees, and who was controlling the business—all while paying themselves more than $75 million,” said Lara S. Mehraban, Acting Director of the New York Regional Office. “We filed this emergency action to stop the ongoing fraud and to preserve assets for investors.”

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC obtained a court order to freeze the assets of Martinsen, Castillero, Lanaia, StraightPath Venture Partners, and StraightPath Management. The order further temporarily enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them not to destroy any additional relevant documents. A hearing on the SEC's application, which also seeks the appointment of a receiver, will be held on May 26, 2022.

The SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Megan R. Genet, Tian Wen, Douglas Smith, Debbie Chan, Lee A. Greenwood, Patricia Schrage, Alistaire Bambach, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Suman Beros. It is being supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Mr. Greenwood and Philip A. Fortino. The SEC appreciates the assistance of Ronald Krietzman, Michael McAuliffe, and Stephen DeBella of the NYRO Broker-Dealer and Exchange Program (BDX), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Office of the Montana State Auditor, Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, and the New Jersey Bureau of Securities.

Prosecutors in Door County, Wisconsin, argued that Carol Jean Pierce, 35, was truly dead, and that her husband Richard Gale Pierce, now 86, is the one who killed her.

Authorities described an ugly relationship when they charged defendant Pierce, a retired member of the U.S. Coast Guard, in 2018. Colleagues who worked with him said Carol Jean started a lot of the fights between them, but neighbors claimed to see her with bruising on her face.

One neighbor said that Carol Jean accused Richard of being responsible for an attack. Another person, who worked as an X-ray technician, said that Carol Jean claimed to have fallen—the neighbor doubted this, however, believing from her work experience that the black eye was from a physical attack.

“I think he’s going to kill me,” Carol Jean said, according to yet another neighbor.

The victim was last seen Sept. 5, 1975 when the couple lived in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, but a missing person report was only filed 82 days later. Richard Pierce divorced Carol Jean in 1977.

Authorities maintained that defendant Pierce had much to gain from Carol Jean’s death: a pension without a wife being in the way; most of the important possessions from their marriage; land and a home in Michigan; a new girlfriend weeks after Carol Jean went missing; and the “benefit of Carol Jean’s silence.”

Defense lawyer Kate Zuidmulder argued her client should not be convicted since Carol Jean’s has never been found, according to WBAY.

“You cannot find my client guilty of these crimes,” the lawyer said. “There literally is no body. And there literally is no proof of human remains.”

To overcome that, prosecutors had to convince jurors that Carol Jean was definitely dead. Assistant District Attorney Nick Grode reportedly rejected the idea that she fled and started a new life without telling anyone. For example, as evidence she did not plan to leave, the prosecutor highlighted letters she sent her mother. Carol Jean planned to move with her husband to Michigan, and she was excited about it.

Despite this, there has been no sign of Carol Jean throughout all these decades, authorities said.

“In checking all of those records, Carol Jean Pierce does not exist in society,” Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation Special Agent Jay Yerges testified, according to WMTV. “Carol Jean Pierce does not exist in society. She’s dead. She’s gone. She does not exist.”

Prosecutors suggested that defendant Pierce hid the victim’s body at his Michigan home but had moved the remains at some point.

Deputy Ronald Fenlon of the Cheboygan County Sheriff’s Office testified about there being a cut in the concrete in 2008 filled with dirt, rock and earth, but this cut was no longer filled in when authorities looked in 2018.

“While videotaping, I was able to observe a void that went back underneath the cement floor of the crawl space,” Fenlon said.

Dog handler Alyssa Palmer testified about participating in the 2018 search with K9 Hela, a human remains detection dog. She said Hela found the presence of such remains at six locations in the Michigan home.

Richard Pierce did not testify, nor did the defense bring up any witnesses.

Sentencing is set for Aug. 5 on a count each of first-degree murder and disinterment of dead, according to WBAY.

QUINLAN, Texas — Steve Norris arrived at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport a few weeks ago to welcome his uncle -- an uncle he’s always known but never met.

“It was the first time we’d been in the same place at the same time,” Norris said. “And it was an opportunity and a moment that you never thought it was going to happen.”

His uncle, Frank Ardith Norris, grew up on a cotton farm in Quinlan during the Great Depression before joining the Army Air Corps and going off to Europe to fight in World War II.

Ardith, as he preferred to be called, was a 23-year-old flight engineer on a B-24 bomber named Old Baldy. On Aug. 1, 1943, Old Baldy was part of a strategic bombing mission by the United States called Operation Tidal Wave.

That day, 178 bombers were sent to Romania in attempt to destroy oil refineries near the city of Ploiesti. Hitler and the Nazis controlled Romania at the time, and Ploiesti was one of the Axis powers top oil suppliers.

However, the German Army was ready for the attack.

Now known as Black Sunday, Operation Tidal Wave remains the second-deadliest air raid in American history.

Only 88 aircraft returned to base in Libya. At least 300 American airmen were killed or missing.

Ardith was one of them.

His nephew Steve said, even in death, his uncle and the crew of Old Baldy were heroes.

“The pilot was still alive enough to control the airplane and crashed into the six-man crew of the German anti-aircraft gun and they killed the guys that killed them,” Steve Norris said.

For his service, Ardith was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, a Purple Heart, the Air Medal with Silver Oak Leaf Cluster, the Greek War Cross with Bronze Crown and the European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Four Stars.

Steve Norris, his sister Nancy Norris Gaddis, and their family members still alive today never met Ardith. He died before any of them were born, but they grew up knowing all about him.

“It was important to our grandparents that his memory stay with us,” Gaddis said.

Said Steve Norris: ""It gave us a real sense of who he was.""

The family loved to talk about Ardith, and one thing they discussed more than anything was finding him.

After Old Baldy was shot down, the remains of Ardith and many other airmen, were never found.

All his family had was a plaque with Ardith’s name that rested in the cemetery where he would have been buried next to his parents.

They spent decades hoping he’d be found, but Ardith’s mom, dad, brother and sisters all died never knowing.

“We had no idea where in Romania he crashed and died and so we had no idea where his remains might be,” Norris said.

Today, there are still roughly 40,000 American servicemembers, from all wars, missing or unaccounted for.

Despite the odds, the Army goes to great lengths to find its lost servicemembers.

“The Army never gave up, they haven’t given up,” Gaddis said.

In 2015, the Army believed it might have a lead on Ardith’s location. Just in case, they asked Steve Norris for a DNA sample, which set him on a mission to learn even more about his uncle.

Norris spent countless hours researching Operation Tidal Wave and his uncle’s service.

He learned that after Ardith’s plane went down, monks from a local monastery moved the remains of the crew to a cemetery about a mile away from the crash site.

However, at some point, the remains were moved to a cemetery in Belgium.

The Army was aware of that when they called Norris for that DNA sample in 2015.

Officials spent a few years gathering more information and making their case in order to exhume the grave in Belgium.

“It was early 2021 when they called us and said, 'We found him,’” Norris said.

Seventy-nine years after leaving for war, Technical Sgt. Frank Ardith Norris came home.

He arrived on an American Airlines flight at DFW Airport.

Norris was overcome with emotion as he touched Ardith’s flag-draped casket.

“Closure has been very important to all of us,” Norris said. “And we feel that sense of closure for his brothers and sisters and his parents and his grandparents.”

“And we are grateful, not only to the Army, but to the nation for bringing him home,” Gaddis said.

Grateful residents lined the roads, waving flags as Ardith was escorted back home to Quinlan. A service was held in the high school auditorium, because there wasn’t a church in town big enough.

“I felt all the emotions that I think my grandmother and my grandfather and my father would feel in that moment,” Norris said. “And it was a little overwhelming. It was very special.”

After the service at the high school, Ardith was buried with full military honors in a small cemetery, in a plot next to his parents.

Just steps from the gravesite a metal rod was fused between two growing trees. A sign hung, explaining that the metal rod is what’s left from a seesaw that sat on the school playground, a seesaw Ardith once played on as a child.

As Ardith was finally laid to rest, tears filled Steve Norris' eyes. Finally, after eight decades, his family had closure. And he finally had a chance to tell his uncle what he’d always wanted to.

“That I loved him without knowing him,"" Steve Norris said. ""That I’m glad he was here. For all of us.”

And that’s the best part: Knowing that he is finally here.",Q2

https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/jun/23/state-senate-ethics-commission-meets-in-closed/,"State senate ethics commission meets in closed session for 5 hours, reviews 2 ethics complaints","The Arkansas Senate Ethics Committee on Wednesday convened in a closed-door executive session for more than five hours to consider evidence after two ethics complaints were filed against state senators last week.

After the end of the committee's executive session, committee Chairman Kim Hammer, R-Benton, announced that the committee concluded its business for the day and would reconvene at 9 a.m. today in the state Capitol.

""We are on the first hearing and because it is ongoing, that's all I can say,"" Hammer said afterward when asked whether the committee held one hearing on one complaint or two hearings on two separate complaints Wednesday.

He declined to disclose who filed the complaints, whom the complaints are filed against, and the nature of the complaints.

""The committee is doing its job, and at this time I'm not at liberty to comment on what was discussed in executive session,"" Hammer said.

The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday appointed Sen. David Wallace, R-Leachville, to the Senate Ethics Committee to temporarily replace a senator on the committee who faces an ethics complaint, until the ethics committee's investigation is completed.

Last week Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, declined to say whether he was temporarily replaced on the ethics committee because he was advised by Hammer through legislative staff not to answer that question.

Hammer permitted Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, and Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, to remain in the Senate Ethics Committee's meeting room Wednesday morning, after Hammer asked the public to leave the meeting room for the committee's closed-door executive session.

Afterward, Hickey said an ethics complaint has not been filed against him. He declined to comment when asked if he filed ethics complaints against Clark and Johnson.

Both Clark and Johnson each declined to comment when asked about speculation in state Capitol circles that the ethics complaints relate to accusations of one senator signing in another senator to be paid per diem for attending at least one legislative committee meeting that the senator didn't attend.

Lawmakers who live more than 50 miles from the state Capitol have been reimbursed at the per diem rate of $155 for attending legislative meetings in Little Rock since Oct. 1, according to Bureau of Legislative Research Director Marty Garrity. Lawmakers who live within 50 miles of the state Capitol are paid a lower per diem rate. Lawmakers are reimbursed at a rate of 58.5 cents a mile for their mileage.

In addition, state representatives and senators are paid $44,356 a year salary by the state except for the House speaker and Senate president pro tempore, whose salary is $50,661 a year.

Hammer told the Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday morning that he received two ethics violation petitions June 15 requesting the committee convene to hear the allegations in the petitions and the Senate's rules require the committee to begin an investigation within 10 business days of receipt of the petitions.

The Senate's rules allow the committee to meet in an executive session to consider the allegations in the complaints, and he intends for the committee to meet in executive session , he said. The committee will handle the two ethics complaints separately, he said.

The Senate's rules require the claimant, who files an ethics complaint, to state the basis of the accusations against the respondent during the committee's hearing, and then the respondent has an opportunity to respond to the accusations, Hammer said. Both parties are permitted to bring witnesses to the hearing, and are allowed to making closing statements before the committee deliberates over its recommendation to the full Senate, he said.

""Once the hearing and committee deliberations are concluded, the public meeting will resume in order to allow a recommendation and a motion to be made and voted on,"" he said. ""This process will be repeated with the claimant and respondent related to the second petition.""

Before the committee went into a closed-door executive session, Austin Bailey, managing editor for the Arkansas Times, told the Senate committee that she objected to the ethics committee holding Wednesday's closed-door executive session, ""if we are discussing the misuse of taxpayer money.

""I feel like taxpayers should be privy to the conversation,"" she said.

Hammer said Bailey's objection is ""duly noted.""

Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, participated in the Senate Ethics Committee's meeting on Wednesday by Zoom.

She told the committee she was participating in the committee's meeting from her home after recently spending several days attending legislative meetings in Little Rock.

Besides Hammer and Irvin, the other ethics committee members who participated in Wednesday's meeting included Sens. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff; Mat Pitsch, R-Fort Smith; Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro; Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock; and Wallace.

Flowers questioned under what authority Irvin could participate in the committee's meeting by Zoom.

Hammer said he granted Irvin permission to participate in the committee's meeting by Zoom based on protocol for the Legislative Council's executive committee that allows its members to participate in its meetings by Zoom. There is no prohibition in the Senate's rules that bar a Senate Ethics Committee member from participating in a meeting by Zoom, he said.

The Senate Rules Committee met last Thursday afternoon in a conference call to get the committee's members together to act in an expeditious fashion, he said.

Hammer said Irvin made a legitimate request to participate in the Senate Ethics Committee's meeting by Zoom and no other members made a similar request.

He said Wednesday that committee member Sen. Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, wouldn't be attending the committee's meeting that day because she was out of town and she didn't ask for permission to participate in Wednesday's meeting by Zoom.

Flowers said she would have asked Hammer to participate in Wednesday's meeting by Zoom if she knew that option existed.

Steve Cook, legal counsel for the state Senate, said at the start of Wednesday's meeting that Senate committees, such as the Senate Ethics Committee, are run by their chairs, who have full authority to decide how to run the committee, subject to a majority of the members concurring. If a majority of the Senate Ethics Committee didn't wanted Irvin to participate in Wednesday's meeting by Zoom, they could vote to overrule Hammer's decision, he said.

Under Flowers' questioning, Hammer said Irvin won't be paid per diem for participating in Wednesday's meeting.

No senator made a motion to overrule Hammer's decision to allow Irvin to participate in Wednesday's meeting by Zoom.

In June 2018, the Senate approved an overhaul of its rules to create a committee on ethics, prohibit senators from certain activities involving conflicts of interest and require more disclosure of other conflicts. The action came after federal investigations in the prior few years led to convictions of five former lawmakers.

With Clark the only audible dissenter in June 2018, then-Senate President Pro Tempore Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, ruled that two-thirds of the body voted by voice to approve changes to its code of ethics.

At that time, Clark said he agreed with most of the new rules.",Q2

A mass shooting on Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas — which left 21 dead, including 19 children and two teachers — has renewed fierce debate over how to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.

As in the aftermath of past mass shootings, elected officials appear divided over gun control reform. President Joe Biden last week urged Congress to ""keep weapons of war off our streets,” drawing support from many Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill. But some Republican members of Congress, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have dismissed the need to dramatically bolster gun laws since reform could prevent ""law-abiding citizens"" from acquiring guns, they argue.

Despite the apparent disagreement, a bipartisan group of senators is discussing potential legislation that could include expanded background checks and red flag laws that keep guns out of the hands of individuals who authorities determine may pose a threat.

Meanwhile, some Republicans proposed alternative solutions such as armed guards and other safety protections at public venues as well as expanded mental health services. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, a Republican, took a wider view, telling reporters that attacks like the one in Uvalde arise from “cultural issues” that legislation has “zero chance” to fix.

The proposals drew rebuke from some Democrats, who accused Republicans of deflecting concerns over the availability of firearms.

Evidence shows that gun control laws offer the most direct and immediate solution for addressing mass shootings, gun violence experts told ABC News. They affirmed the value of a broader approach that encompasses mental health services and a shift in cultural mores.

“From a purely rational, problem-solving perspective, all things should be on the table, including stronger gun control,” Daniel Webster, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, told ABC News.

The states with the lowest gun death rates are those with the strictest gun laws, according to research by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. In particular, the most effective reduction of deadly mass shootings results from policies that require licensing for gun buyers and restrict large-capacity magazines, a 2020 study co-authored by Webster found.

He and other experts have criticized various proposals at limiting mass shootings at schools, including armed guards, narrow and fortified entryways and training drills.

“These solutions are all oriented toward an acceptance that somebody with a gun is going to come into your school, so let’s be prepared,” he said.

In the days following an attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, then-President Donald Trump suggested arming teachers. In 2012, in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, then-National Rifle Association Vice President Wayne LaPierre said, “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”

Mike Lawlor, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven in Connecticut and a former Democratic state lawmaker, told ABC News he questions the effectiveness of an armed officer or teacher in stopping mass shootings.

“If somebody shows up ready, willing and able to get themselves killed and they’ve got an AR-15 and in some cases body armor, what is that guy going to do?” Lawlor said.

School security measures put in place over roughly the last two decades have failed to show empirical evidence that they reduce gun violence in schools, according to a 2019 study published by researchers in the journal Violence and Gender.

On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz said in an appearance on Fox News that schools should address mass shootings by limiting entry and exit to a single door, where armed police can stand guard against an attack.

The proposed solution of a single door raises fire safety concerns, said Webster. It also fails to take an expansive or systemic approach to the causes of mass shootings, he added.

Webster referenced a mass shooting last week at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York – which left 10 dead, all of whom were Black, and three others wounded.

“This can happen in a supermarket or a church. We can go on and on and on about the settings,” he said. “People who want to protect the status quo, make this as narrow a problem as possible and develop the most narrow solution as possible.”

Another proposal that has gained momentum in the aftermath of the shooting in Uvalde is an expansion of mental health services. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week attributed the mass shooting in Uvalde to mental health issues, and he vowed to boost mental health programs.

Mental health advocates criticized Abbott for taking resources away from agencies that oversee mental health programs.

Experts said an expansion of mental health services could help address mass shootings, especially among young people dealing with mental health challenges amid the pandemic.

“Adolescents in particular are really struggling from a mental health standpoint, and they need a lot more than they’re getting,” Webster said. “Those public health approaches can go a long way in preventing these horrible tragedies.”

A significant portion of the adult and adolescent populations have experienced mental health issues. Roughly 49.5% of adolescents have faced a mental health disorder at some point in their lives, the National Institute for Mental Health found in a 2020 survey. Twenty-one percent of the adult population experienced some form of mental illness in 2020, the survey found. Advocates have said that people who suffer from mental health issues are more likely to be victims than perpetrators.

Lawlor, the professor at the University of New Haven, said mental health programs should take up a proactive approach that helps identify students at risk of committing violence.

“It’s one thing to have services available but someone has to plug somebody into it,” he said.

Another view of gun violence treats the problem as the symptom of a broader cultural issue that cannot be addressed through legislation, as put forward by Lankford, the Republican senator from Oklahoma.

Experts acknowledged that the problem owes in part to cultural values, particularly the U.S. gun culture. Lawlor attributed the ongoing popularity of gun culture and the prevalence of guns in part to marketing from gunmakers.

“It’s a historical culture of the U.S. — cowboys, the Wild West and it’s in the Constitution — but this phenomenon of flooding the country with guns deliberately and aggressively is relatively recent,” he added.

Ron Avi Astor, a professor of social welfare at University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in school violence, told ABC News the divisive culture around guns impedes agreement on tangible solutions, including gun regulations.

“Public health is first and foremost about education,” Astor said. “I don’t think we need to approach it as Second Amendment or non-Second Amendment — that’s a rabbit hole that leads us nowhere.”

He added, “I would like us to find common ground — Democrats, Republicans, gun owners, non-gun owners — to at very minimum use guns responsibly with the same regulations as other hazardous materials and things in people’s houses.”",Q2
https://watermarkonline.com/2014/08/26/challenges-to-gay-marriage-bans-where-they-stand/,Challenges to gay marriage bans: Where they stand,"(AP)– State bans on same-sex marriages have been falling around the country since summer 2013, when the Supreme Court ordered the federal government to recognize state-sanctioned gay marriages. The remaining state bans all face legal challenges, and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago will hear arguments Tuesday on cases from Indiana and Wisconsin.

Gay couples can marry in 19 states and the District of Columbia. A look at where cases pending in other states stand:

— ARKANSAS: A state judge in May struck down the state’s ban. The state Supreme Court brought marriages to a halt and is weighing state officials’ appeal. Same-sex couples are also suing the state in federal court. The attorney general’s office has asked that proceedings in both cases be put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to take up a case from Utah.

— COLORADO: Several county clerks began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in June despite the ban. A state judge struck down the ban July 9 but put the ruling on hold while the state appeals. On July 23, a federal judge also overturned the ban but issued a stay; a federal appeals court later extended the stay. The state Supreme Court on July 29 ordered all clerks to stop issuing licenses to same-sex couples. Republican Attorney General John Suthers says that he knows it’s only a matter of time until gay marriage is legal but that he’ll continue to defend the law.

— FLORIDA: A federal judge last week declared the state’s ban unconstitutional, joining state judges in four counties. He issued a stay delaying the effect of his order, meaning no marriage licenses will be immediately issued for gay couples.

— HAWAII: Same-sex couples sued in 2011 to overturn the state’s ban. A federal court later upheld the ban, but then Legislature last year legalized gay marriage. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in San Francisco on Sept. 8, the same day it will consider cases from Idaho and Nevada.

— IDAHO: State officials are appealing a federal judge’s decision to overturn the state’s ban. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is scheduled to hear arguments Sept. 8, the same day it will consider appeals from Hawaii and Nevada.

— INDIANA: A federal judge struck down the state’s ban in June, and hundreds of couples wed before the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago granted a stay of the ruling. The appeals court heard oral arguments from both sides Aug. 25.

— KENTUCKY: Two Kentucky cases were among six from four states heard in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati on Aug. 6. Rulings are pending on recognition of out-of-state marriages, as well as the ban on marriages within the state.

— MICHIGAN: The state’s ban was overturned by a federal judge in March following a rare trial that mostly focused on the impact on children. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati heard arguments Aug. 6, and a ruling is pending.

— NEVADA: Eight couples are challenging Nevada’s voter-approved 2002 ban, which a federal judge upheld a decade later. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has scheduled arguments for Sept. 8, the same day the court will consider appeals from Hawaii and Idaho.

— OHIO: Two Ohio cases were argued Aug. 6 in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a ruling is pending. In one, two gay men whose spouses were dying sued to have their out-of-state marriages recognized on their spouses’ death certificates. In the other, four couples sued to have both spouses listed on their children’s birth certificates.

— OKLAHOMA: An appeals court tossed the state’s ban in July but put its ruling on hold on hold pending an appeal, meaning same-sex couples can’t marry in Oklahoma for now. Attorneys representing the Tulsa County court clerk — who refused to issue a marriage license for a lesbian couple there — asked the Supreme Court this month to hear the case.

— TENNESSEE: The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Aug. 6 on an appeal of a federal judge’s order to recognize three same-sex couples’ marriages while their lawsuit against the state works through the courts. A ruling is pending.

— TEXAS: A federal judge declared the state’s ban unconstitutional, issuing a preliminary injunction. The state is appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, which is soon expected to set a date for arguments.

— UTAH: The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled this summer that Utah must allow gay couples to marry, though it put the ruling on hold pending an appeal. The state has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the state’s ban.

— VIRGINIA: The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond ruled in July that the state’s voter-approved ban is unconstitutional. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a request from a county clerk to delay implementation of the ruling, which would have allowed same-sex couples to marry beginning Aug. 21.

— WISCONSIN: A federal judge struck down the state’s ban in June, leading to more than 500 same-sex weddings before the judge put her ruling on hold. The state appealed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, which heard arguments Aug. 25.

— ELSEWHERE: Other states with court cases demanding recognition of gay marriage are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming. Most lawsuits challenge same-sex marriage bans or ask states to recognize gay marriages done in other states.",Q2

https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/06/23/massachusetts-gun-laws-at-risk-following-supreme-court-ruling,Massachusetts gun laws at risk following Supreme Court ruling,"Massachusetts gun laws are at risk following a 6–3 Supreme Court ruling Thursday, which struck down a New York law limiting carrying guns outside the home. The Court deemed the law unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.

The stricken New York law requires people to show a “proper cause” to obtain a license to carry. Massachusetts’ current laws similarly restrict gun carrying under a statute that gives local police chiefs power to deny licenses if they deem applicants “unsuitable.”

“This decision puts that statute in jeopardy,” said Daniel Medwed, a Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst.

Massachusetts has the second-lowest rate of death by firearm in the country, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control. New York also sits low on the list with the fifth-lowest rate of gun deaths as of 2020.

While the ruling directly affects New York, Medwed said he expects to see gun license applicants in Massachusetts begin to challenge state restrictions based on the Supreme Court ruling. Still, he thinks legislators will attempt to amend Massachusetts laws to keep them legal and create more objective criteria about applicants’ suitability to stay consistent with the ruling.

Lawrence Chief of Police Roy Vasque told GBH News he worries about not having discretion in who receives licenses.

“I have my situations where I deny licenses, where we revoke licenses and we deal with appeals of those as well, so it's not uncommon. It happens,” he said. “But I think Massachusetts requiring a license to carry a firearm and getting a license in order to carry that in public, I think is a good thing. I think basing those on factors like criminal history and even mental history and things like that I think is a no-brainer. So certainly it's concerning that some changes may result in that as a result of this ruling.”

“With all the gun violence in the world and some of the spikes that have happened, I'm kind of amazed, I guess, or stunned that this would have happened in this timeline,” Vasque added.

The Supreme Court’s decision comes as the Senate is advancing a bipartisan gun bill , and in the wake of mass shootings in Buffalo, N.Y., Uvalde, Texas and elsewhere across the country.

Interim Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden came out against the decision Thursday. “I stand with my colleagues in New York and across the country in expressing grave concern about the impact of today’s Supreme Court gun decision,” he said. “It’s ironic, and perhaps tragic, that just as the nation’s top legislative body is formulating sensible firearm regulations, its top judicial body is undoing them.”

Attorney General Maura Healey, U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark and Sen. Ed Markey also criticized the decision.

“We know concealed weapons near schools or on street corners across Massachusetts — or anywhere in our country — won’t make parents or their children feel any safer,” Markey said in a statement. “The Supreme Court has now placed the safety of these families at risk.”

The ruling worries gun control advocates, many of whom see the Supreme Court as an increasingly politicized branch.

“We have an activist court there making up the rules as they go,” said John Rosenthal, co-founder of the Boston-based group Stop Handgun Violence. “They don't represent the majority of Americans that support common sense gun laws and they're dismantling them. In Massachusetts it’s going to have an impact. It's going to make it easier for people who shouldn't have guns to get them.”

For Second Amendment proponents, the ruling comes as a win. “We are really excited, today's an important day for civil rights in this country,” said Jim Wallace, executive director of Gun Owners’ Action League, a Massachusetts-based advocacy group on behalf of gun owners. “It's going to be one more decision we have that's kind of going to force Massachusetts to recognize the Second Amendment as an individual civil right, which it really has not historically.”

In June, The New York Times identified 35 U.S. mass shootings since 1999 in which the stricter gun control legislation in front of the Senate might have made a difference, other countries have seen decreases in gun-related deaths after passing gun restrictions. While the bill poised to pass the Senate does not go as far as many Democrats want, it breaks years of inaction on gun control due to Republican opposition. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruling is the first case concerning gun laws taken up by the highest court since 2008.

Wallace wants to see gun violence tackled as a criminal justice and mental health problem targeting individual offenders, instead of through gun control legislation. Rosenthal, who is also a gun owner, thinks the ruling will lead to more deaths.

“In all likelihood, Massachusetts and all the states that have tougher gun laws and lower gun death rates will see a change, and will see more gun injuries and deaths as a result of this outrageous decision by the Supreme Court,” Rosenthal said.",Q2
https://news.yahoo.com/baltimore-suing-ghost-gun-manufacturer-201409063.html,Baltimore suing ghost gun manufacturer as Maryland ban goes into effect,"The city of Baltimore has filed a lawsuit against the ghost gun manufacturer Polymer80 Inc. alleging the company and its firearms have created a public health crisis in the city.

In a statement on Wednesday, the city said that Polymer80, the nation’s largest gun manufacturer, intentionally undermined various federal and state firearm laws to manufacture, design and sell ghost gun kits and parts to customers without a background check.

The city announced the lawsuit on the same day the state’s new gun law went into effect.

The law prohibits people from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell or transferring ghost guns. It also prohibits people from selling or offering to sell firearms that are not legally licensed.

The city said in its lawsuit that Polymer80’s main customers are those who are trying to avoid law enforcement or who cannot obtain a gun with a legal license, such as those who are underage, who are gun traffickers or who have past criminal convictions.

The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturer had not complied with the Maryland Handgun Register law or the Maryland Handgun Qualification License law prior to the state’s ban on the sale of ghost guns going into effect.

“Ghost guns are a devastating menace to the people of Baltimore,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) said in a statement.

“This lawsuit shines a light on Polymer80 and individuals who routinely create a marketplace for deadly, untraceable weapons. The availability of these weapons – particularly to criminals, juveniles and other people who are prohibited from owning a firearm – presents a growing public health crisis. We must stop Polymer80 and companies like it that profit from destroying our communities,” he added.

The lawsuit also names Hanover Armory, a local gun shop in Maryland, as a defendant in the case and alleges that the store sells Polymer80 kits without determining whether its customers are prohibited from owning firearms.

In a statement, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said he supports Scott’s lawsuit, adding he will keep fighting for gun reform on the federal level.

“We cannot & will not accept senseless gun violence as normal. The crackdown on ghost guns here in MD is a step fwd, but our state is not an island,” Van Hollen said in a tweet. “As @MayorBMScott takes on manufacturers & our new law goes into effect, I’ll keep fighting for federal, common-sense gun safety laws.”

House Democrats have scheduled a special session of the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday to send a slate of tougher firearms rules to the chamber floor.

Democrats are facing a more difficult lift in the Senate. A bipartisan group of senators is currently negotiating a bill in response to recent mass shootings in a Buffalo, N.Y., grocery store and in a school in Uvalde, Texas.

The Senate group is reportedly focusing on incentives for states to create “red flag” laws to seize weapons from those deemed a threat to themselves or others. The senators are also looking at legislation to expand background checks for firearms sales and transfers.

https://theweek.com/us/1012196/white-house-officials-and-left-wing-media-critics-convinced-themselves-that-the-media,Democrats can't escape reality. They shouldn't try.,"Democrats are going to have a tough time in this year's midterm elections, but things will probably go worse for them if they try to reframe reality out of existence.

Take the crime issue. We know that murder rates rose dramatically in 2020, the last year of Donald Trump's presidency, and that they remain elevated in many places across the U.S. Republicans have made hay with the issue, blaming ""woke"" district attorneys and a ""defund the police"" campaign that never really came to fruition.

But some Dems are pointing to a new study by the Third Way think tank showing that states carried by Trump in 2020 had a higher per-capita murder rate that year than states carried by Joe Biden. The states with the highest homicide rates? Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Alabama, and Missouri. Third Way dubbed this ""The Red State Murder Problem,"" and a few left-of-center folks have been eager to amplify that notion.

""No one seems to notice a murder in Mississippi, because it just doesn't conform to the story that gets told over and over again,"" one of the report's authors, Jim Kessler, told the Washington Post.

Mississippi is an interesting example. It's true that the state had 315 murders in 2020, giving it the third-highest per-capita homicide rate in the nation. But 128 of those killings — a third of the total — took place in the state's largest city, Jackson, which has long been governed by Democrats. Similarly, more than half of Missouri's 723 murders in 2020 happened in the Dem-run cities of Kansas City and St. Louis. Democrats and their allies will have a tough time convincing voters that crime is really a ""red state murder problem"" when so much of it is concentrated in blue cities.

There's a similar issue with the economy. Voters hate it. Democrats are trying to acknowledge those concerns while also making the case the economy is actually stronger than Americans think. Take this Monday tweet from the president:

It doesn't seem that voters are listening to the optimistic part of the message. Politico on Tuesday reported on a focus group of Democratic voters who lamented the effects of rising prices. ""It just seems like everything is going up and there's no end in sight,"" one woman said.

The truth is that murders are too high, and so is inflation. Democrats don't have to merely play defense on these issues — they can, for example, make a stronger case that the GOP's lax gun policies have helped drive violent crime. But they won't be saved by out-of-touch happy talk or shifting blame in ways that don't ring true with voters. Reality usually has a way of winning out.",Q2
https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/west/2022/04/26/310092.htm,Emergency Declaration for Multiple Wildfires in New Mexico,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed emergency declarations as 20 wildfires continued to burn Sunday in nearly half of the state’s drought-stricken 33 counties.

One wildfire in northern New Mexico that started April 6 merged with a newer fire Saturday to form the second-largest blaze in the state at more than 66 square miles (171 square kilometers), leading to widespread evacuations in Mora and San Miguel counties.

Another wind-driven wildfire in northern New Mexico that began April 17 has charred at least 76 square miles (197 square kilometers) of ponderosa pine, oak brush and grass north of Ocate, an unincorporated community in Mora County.

Meanwhile in Arizona, some residents forced to evacuate due to a wildfire near Flagstaff were allowed to return home Sunday morning.

Winds and temperatures in New Mexico diminished Saturday but remained strong enough to still fan fires. Dozens of evacuation orders remained in place.

Fire officials were expecting the northern wildfires to slow Sunday as cloud and smoke cover moves in, allowing the forests to retain more moisture. But they added that the interior portions of the fires could show moderate to extreme behavior, which could threaten structures in those areas.

More than 200 structures have been charred by the wildfires thus far and an additional 900 remain threatened, Lujan Grisham said.

Fire management officials said an exact damage count was unclear because it’s still too dangerous for crews to go in and look at all the homes that have been lost.

“We do not know the magnitude of the structure loss. We don’t even know the areas where most homes made it through the fire, where homes haven’t been damaged or anything like that,” said operation sections chief Jayson Coil.

Some 1,000 firefighters were battling the wildfires across New Mexico, which already has secured about $3 million in grants to help with the fires.

Lujan Grisham said she has asked the White House for more federal resources and she’s calling for a ban of fireworks statewide.

“We need more federal bodies for firefighting, fire mitigation, public safety support on the ground in New Mexico,” she said. “It’s going to be a tough summer. So that’s why we are banning fires. And that is why on Monday I will be asking every local government to be thinking about ways to ban the sales of fireworks.”

Wildfire has become a year-round threat in the West given changing conditions that include earlier snowmelt and rain coming later in the fall, scientist have said. The problems have been exacerbated by decades of fire suppression and poor management along with a more than 20-year megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change.

In Arizona, two large wildfires continued to burn Sunday 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Prescott and 14 miles (22 kilometers) northeast of Flagstaff.

Coconino County authorities lifted the evacuation order Sunday morning for residents living in neighborhoods along Highway 89 after fire management officials determined the Flagstaff-area wildfire no longer posed a threat.

The fire near Flagstaff was at 32 square miles (83 square kilometers) as of Saturday night. It forced the evacuation of 766 homes and burned down 30 homes and two dozen other structures since it began a week ago, according to county authorities.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey declared the fire a state of emergency Friday for Coconino County to free up recovery aid to affected communities.

The wildfire near Prescott began last Monday and was at 4.8 square miles (12.4 square kilometers) and 15% contained as of Sunday morning as helicopters and air tankers dropped water and retardant to slow the fire’s growth.

The cause of the wildfires in New Mexico and Arizona remain under investigation.

https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/legal-appeals-could-keep-man-who-killed-sdpd-officer-in-prison-despite-court-order-for-release,Legal appeals could keep man who killed SDPD officer in prison despite court order for release,"SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — California Governor Gavin Newsom could potentially appeal a recent court ruling that would allow Jesus Cecena, who murdered San Diego Police Officer Archie Buggs in 1978, to be released from prison. Newsom had overturned the Parole Board's most recent approval of release for Cecena in 2020.

Cecena killed Buggs execution-style during a traffic stop. Buggs partner, former officer Jesse Navarro, says the killing was a pre-meditated action taken to enhance Cecena's status in his gang. “I have seen a lot of horrible things. I’ve seen some great things. But something like this is always, always lived and will stay in my memory,"" Navarro told ABC 10News.

Cecena was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. However, a change in state law allowed Cecena to begin applying for parole in 2014. The Parole Board has approved the application five times, deciding that Cecena was no longer a threat to the public. However, parole was overturned by the governor each time, first by Jerry Brown, and most recently by Newsom. After the most recent rejection, Cecena asked the court to rule that it was illegal to keep him in prison after being approved for release so many times. A judge ruled in favor of Cecena, setting up his potential release by the end of May.

San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan is calling on Newsom to order California Attorney General Rob Bonta to appeal. Stephan told ABC 10News Cecena has never taken full responsibility for his actions. “He continues to minimize, deceive, and not tell the truth, not take accountability about the gravity of the crime.” Stephan says Cecena's refusal to admit the reasons for his actions mean he could still pose a threat to the public. “That makes him not suitable, not ready to come out. Because he has not really shown true ownership over what he did,"" Stephan said.

ABC 10News spoke with legal analyst Alex Ozols, a former criminal defense attorney, about the Cecena case, with which he is not involved. He says the court considers different criteria than prosecutors or the governor. “The judge, apparently, had a different understanding of whether or not this person was rehabilitated and would be dangerous in the future.”

Despite the heinous nature of the crime, Ozols questions whether it is just to continue overruling Cecena's release, especially after five different parole reviews have recommended it. He also says the appeals process, if Governor Newsom moves forward, could keep Cecena in prison for years, essentially going around the judge's order. ""This individual is 61 years old. They may just keep appealing and keep appealing and keep this going because, essentially, his life is going to be over soon in prison.”

A spokesperson for Governor Newsom told ABC 10News they were reviewing the court's ruling.",Q2

The film, which is scheduled to open on Nov. 23, will follow three generations of a family of explorers and take viewers “to a place of infinite mystery unlike anything you’ve ever seen,” according to a trailer released by the studio earlier this month.

Several Hollywood powerhouses have been confirmed as part of the voice cast, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Gabrielle Union, Lucy Liu, Dennis Quaid and Jaboukie Young-White.

On Friday, Disney screened three sequences from the film at the 2022 Annecy International Animation Film Festival, one of the world’s most important festivals for the film animation industry that takes place in the city of Annecy, in southeast France.

In one of them, Ethan (Young-White) flirts with a boy named Diazo in front of his friends, who tease him in a friendly way.

His father, Searcher Clade (Gyllenhaal), later joins in and embarrasses him in “an overeager show of acceptance,” as the scene is described by Variety.

Emmy Award-winning producer Matthieu Saghezchi, who also saw the sequence, wrote on Twitter that the scene is “very endearing” and it’s “treated as the most natural thing in the world.”

“The scene describes the son being very shy in front of his boy crush, and his dad comes in and says “so nice to meet you! my son talks about you all the time” and further embarrasses his son,” Saghezchi wrote. “Very cute.”

The refreshing nod to inclusivity comes as “Lightyear,” the much-anticipated “Toy Story” spinoff, was reportedly banned in 14 countries over a brief same-sex kiss.

The Disney-Pixar computer-animated adventure film starring Chris Evans as the voice of Buzz Lightyear features a kiss between Alisha, voiced by the actress Uzo Aduba, and her wife Kiko.

On Monday, the United Arab Emirates announced that the film would not be shown in the country “due to its violation of the country’s media standards.”

According to Reuters, at least 13 other countries in Asia and the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia and Lebanon, have also banned the film.

“Lightyear,” which opens in 4,200 North American theaters this weekend, is expected to make between $70 million and $80 million.",Q2

As a gun owner, longtime hunter, and supporter of the Second Amendment, I feel it is time to ban the sale and ownership of assault-style rifles. However, it is too late to do so. Our society is riddled with military-style weapons, and stopping the flow now is too little, too late.

I’ve owned AR weapons in the past. Bought them on sale when a gun store was going out of business. Even then, it was a waste of money and I donated them to a museum, along with some other weapons that are more suited for military use.

When I served as chief of staff for a member of Congress in the 1980s, I knew and dealt with the lobbyists of the National Rifle Association. Over drinks at the Capitol Hill Club one night, NRA lobbyist Terri O’Grady told me that what she and others do were “a sham on Congress and America.”

“We serve the gun manufacturers, not the owners of firearms,” she said. “Our sole goal is to help them sell more firearms to more people and block any legislation that gets in the way of that goal.”

NRA executive vice-president Wayne LaPierre padded his personal finances with NRA money, embezzling millions, yet remains on the job because the gun manufacturers feel he is “one of us.”

In other words, a crook. Over the weekend in Houston, at NRA’s annual meeting, the board re-elected LaPierre. As the New York Post reported: “Scandal-scarred Wayne LaPierre re-elected as NRA CEO.”

Reuters reports:

The National Rifle Association board reappointed Wayne LaPierre as executive vice president on Monday, turning back the latest leadership challenge amid corruption allegations and flat membership for the still-powerful gun lobby. The board vote came as the NRA held its annual meeting in Houston, about 280 miles (450 km) east of the site of a mass shooting on Tuesday, when an 18-year-old armed with an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle killed 19 children and two teachers at a Texas elementary school.

New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the NRA in 2020, saying the organization paid for family trips to the Bahamas, private jets, and expensive meals and clothes that contributed to a $64 million reduction in the NRA’s balance sheet in three years, turning a surplus into a deficit.

The organization claims LaPierre is “reimbursing” them for his lavish spending and embezzlement.

“The N.R.A. is now mainly a media company, promoting a lifestyle built around loving guns and hating anyone who might take them away, ” writes Mike Spies in the New Yorker.

He adds:

Marc Owens, who served for ten years as the head of the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt enterprises, recently reviewed these records. “The litany of red flags is just extraordinary,” he said. “The materials reflect one of the broadest arrays of likely transgressions that I’ve ever seen. There is a tremendous range of what appears to be the misuse of assets for the benefit of certain vendors and people in control.” Owens added, “Those facts, if confirmed, could lead to the revocation of the N.R.A.’s tax-exempt status”—without which the organization could likely not survive.

But the NRA, and LaPierre, survive to fleece its members and America while promoting the sale of dangerous weapons that are used far too often to kill people, including the 19 fourth graders in Texas this month.

It is time for serious gun control and prosecution of those who facilitate the use of dangerous weapons to massacre children.

https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-alito-tipped-his-climate-hand-in-anti-abortion-draft/,How Alito tipped his climate hand in anti-abortion draft,"The inclusion of one word in the draft Supreme Court abortion ruling is raising concerns among environmental lawyers that the justices are preparing to get more aggressive about rejecting climate lawsuits that come before the nation’s highest bench.

The February draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, authored by Justice Samuel Alito and reported by POLITICO this week, argues that the landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that ensured a right to an abortion was “egregiously wrong from the start.”

Alito also contends that abortion cases have “diluted” and “flouted” other areas of the law and have “ignored the court’s third-party standing doctrine,” under which courts can reject lawsuits if they find the challenger has not demonstrated a harm that meets the standard of a “case” or “controversy” under Article III of the Constitution.

“He’s casting doubt on third-party standing,” said Josh Gellers, a professor at the University of North Florida who studies environmental politics. “One of the more popular avenues for pursuing climate change litigation has been through a third party. If what Alito is signaling is a willingness to be stricter with how the court interprets third-party standing, then organizations may have a more difficult time trying to represent the interests of individuals.”

Gellers said a more narrow interpretation of standing would be “like death by a thousand cuts. It’s much more difficult to try and litigate climate change on an individual basis than it would be to have large groups. It could put the onus on people as individuals, as opposed to organizations representing their interests.”

Some legal experts have expressed fears that the Supreme Court’s conservative wing could seize on the opportunity to rehash climate standing doctrine established in the 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA if the justices were to eventually review the kids’ climate case, Juliana v. United States. The Juliana lawsuit argues that the government’s support for fossil fuels worsens climate change.

But Julia Olson — executive director and chief legal counsel of Our Children’s Trust, which represents the young challengers — said she’s confident the case would clear the court’s third-party standing analysis because it focuses on harms to individuals.

“Third-party standing comes up when someone is litigating on behalf of someone else, but a lot of organizations rely on the harms of their members to bring the cases forward,” she said. “There’s no question in the Supreme Court’s precedent that if you have been injured by your government, you can come to court and bring a constitutional case.”

The fear among environmentalists, however, is that the justices will use the doctrine selectively, applying it to keep some plaintiffs out of court while allowing other cases to proceed (Greenwire, July 19, 2021).

Indeed, Alito, who was quizzed by Democrats at his confirmation hearing for taking a narrow approach to standing when he was a federal appeals court judge, last year embraced a more expansive view of standing than his colleagues in a case involving Texas’ and other states’ ability to challenge the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

“The ACA saddles [the states] with expensive and burdensome obligations, and those obligations are enforced by the federal government. That is sufficient to establish standing,” Alito wrote in a dissent, disagreeing with the majority decision to uphold the health care law.

Jonathan Brightbill, who served as principal deputy assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s environment division under former President Donald Trump, said he didn’t see anything in Alito’s language in the Dobbs draft ruling to suggest significance for environmental or climate cases.

“The point I read that Justice Alito is making is that Roe v. Wade, rather than sitting comfortably within the Supreme Court’s broader precedents … has been the source of many discordant precedents,” he said. “I read him to be saying that the barriers [for standing] should have been the same all along. And yet, exceptions were being made for Roe v. Wade.”

Brightbill continued: “Everyone is seeing in this what they want to see, either in service of trying to advance themselves or undercut the decision in advance and raise the temperature even more.”

John Echeverria, a professor at Vermont Law School, noted that Alito’s reference to the standing doctrine cites, among other cases, the 2020 decision June Medical Services v. Russo, in which the court struck down a Louisiana law that would have limited access to abortions. In that case, which split the court 4-1-4, Chief Justice John Roberts agreed with the plurality that the abortion providers had third-party standing.

In the draft Dobbs opinion, Alito cited his dissent in which he argued that the abortion providers should not have standing. Three other justices joined his opinion, at least in part.

The court has undergone a dramatic ideological shift since June Medical. Later in 2020, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative, replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal reproductive rights champion, resulting in a 6-3 conservative majority on the bench.

“Significantly, while three justices joined in Alito’s dissenting opinion in June Medical, [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh did not join in the part of the opinion that addressed third-party standing,” Echeverria said in an email, adding that “one might surmise that the addition of Barrett to the court could supply the conservatives with four solid votes in support of Alito’s narrow view of third-party standing.”

And Echeverria said it may be one of the reasons that Roberts has emphasized that the Dobbs opinion is only a draft. A final ruling is expected this summer.

“Kavanaugh might object to the discussion of the third-party standing in the ghost opinion insofar as it suggests that the Alito dissent in June Medical now represents the viewpoint of the majority of the court on third-party standing,” Echeverria said.

Alito on standing

Democrats questioned Alito about his views on standing in environmental cases during his 2006 Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California cited Alito’s position on standing when she voted against him for the high court seat, saying she was troubled that he had adopted a narrow reading of standing in a case in which environmentalists unsuccessfully fought to sue a chemical company over water pollution.

“In doing so, his conclusion would have gutted the provision that allows individual citizens to enforce the law,” Feinstein said in a statement at the time.

She and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, then the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, both questioned Alito’s view of standing at his confirmation hearing, asking him whether he agreed with a 2000 Supreme Court decision that found an environmental group could sue over Clean Water Act violations, even after the pollution had stopped.

Feinstein noted that the high court’s ruling in Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Environmental Services had rejected Alito’s previous decision on standing in a 1996 case.

“It’s a precedent of the court, and I have respect for it,” Alito told Feinstein at the time. He added that the finding was “governed by stare decisis” — the concept that the judiciary is bound by precedent.

Alito noted that Laidlaw came after the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Public Interest Research Group v. Magnesium Elektron, in which he joined a 2-1 majority that found the environmental group’s lawsuit against a manufacturer was improper because it couldn’t prove it or a river and its tributaries were injured by pollution.

“I haven’t gone back and thought about the question of whether Laidlaw creates doubt about the soundness of the decision in Magnesium Elektron,” Alito told Feinstein at the time. He added that if the issue came again, he “would follow Supreme Court precedent if I concluded that it was in conflict with the decision of the prior court of appeals decision.”

Alito went on to say that the Supreme Court has said its jurisdiction is limited to cases and controversies, and “that means you have to have a plaintiff who has suffered injury in fact.”

He added that all three judges on the Magnesium Elektron panel agreed that the plaintiffs “had not even alleged personal injury. “

Feinstein returned to the question of standing at Justice Elena Kagan’s 2010 confirmation hearing, asking the then-solicitor general whether she believed people can demonstrate standing to sue for environmental damages, including climate change.

“The answer is yes, depending on — much depending on what Congress does,” Kagan responded, pointing to economic injuries and health impacts like asthma from high levels of ozone.

She continued, “It can also be a kind of injury that you get when the environment is degraded and you can’t use the parks in the way you would have wanted to use the parks.”",Q2

But, San Francisco federal district court Judge James Donato left the door open for Trump and other plaintiffs to file an amended complaint against Twitter that is consistent with his written decision to toss the lawsuit in its entirety, reports CNBC.

The micro-blogging platform had banned Trump on January 8, 2021, citing the risk of the incitement of further violence on the heels of the Capitol riot by a mob of supporters of the then-President two days earlier.

Trump, the American Conservative Union and five individuals had sued Twitter and its co-founder Jack Dorsey last year on behalf of themselves and a class of other platform users who had been booted from the app.

The ruling comes nearly two weeks after Trump told CNBC he had no interest in returning to Twitter even if his ban were to be lifted by Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO whose $44 billion offer to buy the site has been accepted by the company's board.

Before the ban, Trump was an avid Twitter user, tweeting an average of more than 30 posts per day toward the end of his presidency, the CNBC report said.

Filmmakers take part in their own fashion, using their lenses to bring the reality of these universal dangers to the masses and a sense of humanity to the stories — like the villagers who lose their livelihoods, their homes to disappearing water supplies.

This year, we at the Sundance Institute choose to focus on perhaps the most urgent of all environmental threats: global warming. We have selected eight films about climate change, which take a look at rising temperatures not only across the land, but also in the seas.

From the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth to 2022’s winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Festival, Utama, check out these explorations of the harmful effects of weather changes globally. (For a more in-depth piece on Utama, click here).",Q2

CANAL WINCHESTER, Ohio — A community came together to show support for the LGBTQ community after a pride flag was lit on fire outside a Canal Winchester church Tuesday night.

Within hours of the news, people came together outside David's United Church of Christ to pray and show support.

""This is an inclusive church where all people are welcome,"" Reverend James Semmelroth Darnell said.

Darnell said he started getting calls, text messages and emails early Wednesday morning from people who saw the burned flag outside his church.

He said for now, the flag is staying up.

""It says that we are still here. We are still sending this message of love and affirmation to the community,"" Darnell said.

For Jonelle Lancaster, who came out to support the church Wednesday, the flag is a symbol of all the hardships that people in the LGBTQ community have had to endure. She said this was a teaching moment for her and her children.

""We have to go to the core of why we are still marching, why we are still showing up for events even as small as this. We are here we aren't leaving. We just want to raise our family in an environment that accepts them,"" Lancaster said.

As supporters stood around a charred flag, their message to whoever is responsible is simple.

""God loves you and we forgive you but we aren't going to be deterred from loving and affirming LGBTQ folks,"" Darnell said.

A member of the congregation donated a new flag to the church. Darnell said it will go up at some point.",Q2
https://prospect.org/justice/red-state-war-against-women-gays-transgender-americans/,"The Red-State War Against Women, Gays, Transgender Americans …","× Expand Sean Murphy/AP Photo Abortion rights advocates gather outside the Oklahoma Capitol, April 5, 2022, in Oklahoma City, to protest several anti-abortion bills being considered by the GOP-led legislature.

Last Tuesday, the Oklahoma legislature passed an anti-abortion bill that criminalizes health care providers for performing abortions at any time during a woman’s pregnancy and provides only a narrow exception to save the mother’s life. It is the latest bill to be initially modeled after Texas’s controversial and contested “ heartbeat bill ” that not only prohibits abortion, but incentivizes citizens to sue people who aid or abet the practice.

After the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Texas bill to stand, state lawmakers were emboldened to create their own copycats. There are at least 35 bills modeled after the “vigilante loophole,” according to The Washington Post.

Granted, these are not all abortion bills, and they’re not all done by the GOP (though a majority are). But the Texas law triggered other real-world effects. Few Texas women have been granted an abortion since the bill was passed. In consequence, so many women traveled north, making up 60 percent of cases in Oklahoma over a five-month period according to The Texas Tribune, that it prompted that state’s Republican lawmakers to pass their own ban.

Or maybe Republicans didn’t require any urgency. Whether due to a desire to ratchet up wedge issues before an election, or the confidence that comes with a Supreme Court securely in conservative hands, GOP bills that limit bodily autonomy and subjugate vulnerable populations on increasingly radical grounds—with or without “vigilante” provisions—are passing through Republican-led state chambers with little pause or pushback, and there is no end in sight.

The Oklahoma bill’s final iteration does not include a so-called “vigilante provision.” Instead, lawmakers wrote a separate bill for that, Senate Bill 1503, or their very own “Oklahoma Heartbeat Act.” Like the Texas bill, it allows up to $10,000 in potential damages through a civil suit against a doctor who performs, or someone who aids or abets, an abortion.

These provisions are built around the idea that it’s not the state enforcing a restriction before 24 weeks of pregnancy, which has been decidedly unconstitutional since Roe v. Wade. Instead, it lays the burden on the shoulders of citizens, in an attempt to shield the state from legal challenges.

These laws are about control over women and their bodies, rooted in misogyny and the patriarchy.

As Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, wrote for the Prospect last year when the Supreme Court let the Texas law stand, “Under the Court’s decision, a state can create civil liability for any constitutionally protected behavior, and so long as no state official plays any role in enforcing it, the law will remain on the books until someone violates it, is sued, and then challenges the law in court.”

This approach is just vague enough to take advantage of our “deeply polarized” society, as Chemerinsky described it to me. It creates enough confusion to let such statutes stand for however long there’s a conservative Court majority.

As many feminists have argued, these laws are about control over women and their bodies, rooted in misogyny and the patriarchy. That intent is perhaps most starkly demonstrated by the Oklahoma abortion bills, seen as the toughest in the nation , with ten-year felony sentences for doctors performing the procedures.

Dozens of states have prepared their own abortion bans in advance of a looming Supreme Court decision on one such ban in Mississippi that’s expected to overturn Roe , or at minimum to restrict freedom of choice to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. While many Democrat-led states have shored up their abortion rights, the inevitable influx of patients seeking care from the states that have simultaneously prepared bills to outright ban the practice would increase the wait times for women traveling across state lines for the procedure.

The net effect of such Court rulings and these red-state laws is to subjugate a group of people and encourage them to live in fear. It’s an adaptable strategy—just look east from Texas to Florida, where the so-called “ don’t say gay ” bill has drawn criticism from many corners.

That bill prohibits education about sexual orientation and gender identities until the third grade. After that, it must be “age-appropriate,” with no precise definition of what that means.

The GOP has couched these bills in “anti-pedophile” rhetoric, asserting that because children are vulnerable, these extra steps must be taken to protect them. Children who are going to be gay will be gay no matter where they get taught, but with these bills, they, and multiple groups of people, will be humiliated. Many teachers will not be able to be themselves—some have been fired for being LGBTQ educators in Florida and Texas (where there isn’t even legislation yet)—and children’s minds will be shrouded in ignorance and hand-me-down hatred.

Similar bills are circulating. In Louisiana , pending bills would bar educators from discussing their sexuality with students up to the 12th grade. Alabama lawmakers tacked similar provisions onto an anti-transgender piece of legislation, another tool in the strategy gaining traction among red states.

These bills spur hatred and sow seeds of division in an already dangerously divided nation. They are a successor to Jim Crow laws that reinforced swaths of white people in believing that Black people were not worthy of humane treatment, much less a vote. The current campaign for them is not just political strategy; it’s also a coordinated attempt to maintain the power of subjugation.",Q2
https://www.thetrumpet.com/25737-has-cambodia-become-a-chinese-colony,Has Cambodia Become a Chinese Colony?,"China is covertly building a naval base on Cambodia’s coast that its military will have exclusive access to, the Washington Post reported on June 6, stressing that both the Chinese and Cambodians are “taking extraordinary measures to conceal the operation.”

The facility is located at Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand. The Chinese military, according to a United States government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, will have “exclusive use of the northern portion of the base, while their presence would remain concealed.”

The secrecy around the Chinese base is likely fueled by Cambodian worries about a domestic backlash, particularly since the nation’s constitution bans foreign military bases inside its borders. Details about why Cambodian authorities are apparently flouting the law to let China in remain unknown. But it is clear that China acquiring an ability to launch military operations from the Gulf of Thailand will strengthen its ability to enforce claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea. A military presence on Cambodia’s coast will also extend China’s influence over the strategically vital Strait of Malacca, through which some 90 percent of South China Sea crude oil shipments pass.



The PLA-N Naval Base in Ream, Cambodia Poses a Significant Threat to Regional & QUAD Allies.

American officials have been taken aback by Cambodia’s decision to allow China to establish such a game-changing presence in their country, largely because Washington has spent lavishly over the years to develop Cambodia, in an effort to win it over as a U.S. partner.

Billions of U.S. dollars have been pumped into Cambodia for military aid, education, poverty reduction and economic development. America has assisted with training Cambodian soldiers and built military installations in the nation—including parts of the Ream Naval Base where China is now moving in.

But despite America’s outlay and overtures, Cambodia is snubbing the U.S. and granting the Chinese strategically valuable access to their territory.

Analysts are particularly concerned that China’s new base could undercut U.S. power in the event of an attack on American partners in the region, such as Japan, the Philippines, South Korea or Taiwan. Should one of these U.S. allies come under attack, many of the U.S. forces charged with their defense would customarily pass through the Strait of Malacca. But by using naval forces based in Cambodia, China could seriously complicate the transit of these U.S. forces.

China’s base in Cambodia is only the latest increase in Beijing’s ability to project military power around the world at the expense of U.S might. This trend is rapidly advancing and it simultaneously advances three developments that are significant in light of Bible prophecy: the beginning of “the times of the Gentiles,” the amalgamation of “the kings of the east,” and the waning of America.

‘The Times of the Gentiles’

Luke 21:24 speaks of a time in the modern age when mankind would enter into an era called “the times of the Gentiles.”

In his February 2020 article “The Climax of Man’s Rule Over Man,” Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry discussed this coming epoch, explaining that the term Gentile in this context refers to “two major powers—one revolving around Russia and China, and the other around Germany. Each will have strong allies ….”

When these “times” are in full effect, U.S. influence will have vanished. And nations such as China will have filled the vacuum of power. “These ‘times of the Gentiles’ are yet to be fully realized,” Mr. Flurry wrote. “However, we are in the outer edges of this catastrophic storm.”

Cambodia’s cold shoulder to America and extraordinary invitation to China blows this “catastrophic storm” closer.

‘The Kings of the East’

Revelation 9:16 discusses an Eastern military force that will emerge during the same “Gentile” era. This force will consist of 200 million soldiers. Revelation 16:12 calls this future Asian group “the kings of the east,” with the pluralized “kings” indicating a multinational bloc made of multiple Asian countries. Ezekiel 38 provides several details about this military alliance, including that it will be led by Russia, with China in a position of secondary leadership.

When Asian states such as Cambodia rally behind China today, conditions are being created for “the kings of the east” prophecy to be fulfilled.

The Decline of ‘Israel’

The late world-renowned educator Herbert W. Armstrong forecast decades ago of the collapse of U.S. power. Just after America’s botched invasion of Cuba in 1961, he laid the blame at the feet of, not the U.S. military or even the Kennedy administration, but the people of America: “Unless or until the United States as a whole repents and returns to what has become a hollow slogan on its dollars: ‘In God we trust,’ the United States of America has won its last war! [T]he God America has deserted gave it its most humiliating defeat! What does the Cuban debacle mean? It means, Mr. and Mrs. United States, that the handwriting is on your wall!” (Plain Truth, October 1961).

Mr. Armstrong understood that America was heading for collapse because the people had refused to turn to God. And he made his forecasts with confidence because they are founded on Bible prophecy. The Bible includes remarkably specific forecasts for the descendants of Israel, which include the people of America. God said that if the nations of Israel refused to turn to Him, He would “break the pride of [their] power” (Leviticus 26:19).

In the six decades since Mr. Armstrong wrote those words, the people of the U.S. have intensified their rejection of God and His law. And in the time since, America has entered into dozens of military clashes, with each half-hearted campaign sapping a little more of the nation’s pride in its power.

Luke 21:26 shows that these various trends will culminate in a time of unprecedented global calamity and suffering when “men’s hearts” will be “failing them for fear.” Yet the next verse says that the calamity will end with the most transformative event in all of human history. The times of the Gentiles, the outer edges of which humanity is already in, will transition directly into a time of utterly unprecedented harmony and prosperity for the peoples of China, Cambodia, America and all countries.

COLUMBIA, SC (WOLO)– The name of a 19-year-old who was killed in an officer involved shooting Friday has been released. Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher identified the suspect who was shot and killed as Tyler Mehki Sincere Boages. The coroner says his cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body.

Lexington County deputies and other agencies responded to what they described as a mental health situation involving a gun this afternoon.

“This incident started after a 911 caller reported a mental health patient in her family was threatening to shoot family members and himself at an apartment off Feather Run Trail,” Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon said. “As officers arrived, he ran away from the scene. The subject ran into some nearby woods where, after officers ordered him to drop his gun, he fired shots at officers. Officers then returned fire.”

Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon says the 19-year-old suspect, who was carrying a handgun with a high capacity magazine, was struck and killed by gunfire. Officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave.

“This has been a tough day. We have a grieving mother and family dealing with these mental issues and they’re going through a tragedy right now,” Koon said. “These officers will never be the same. They had to dodge bullets and do their job today. That’s a lot of hurt. There are no winners here.” Back in January 2021, the Richland County Sheriff’s Department says deputies arrested Boages in connection with a December 2020 shooting on Broad River Road that claimed the life of another man.

JournalismPakistan.com | Published February 03, 2017

The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) Thursday launched the IFJ list of journalists and media staff killed in 2016, documenting the deaths of colleagues killed in the line of duty.

In the Asia-Pacific region, 28 journalists were brutally murdered in 2016, an increase from 2015. The report, which is now in its 26th year, is a key tool in the IFJ’s continued efforts to tackle impunity for crimes against journalists and campaign for greater safety.

In the Asia Pacific region, there have been some wins, but with each comes a devastating blow to the efforts made to secure the safety of journalists worldwide. In the last two years, the IFJ Asia-Pacific cautiously noted a marked reduction in media killings in Pakistan. While actions in Pakistan to tackle journalist fatalities and shocking impunity levels finally seem to be making some difference, the situation in neighbouring Afghanistan and India is taking a worrying trajectory.



Afghanistan is now our region’s frontline, with 13 journalists brutally murdered in 2016. The year started with the loss of seven media workers from Tolo TV in a suicide bomb attack on their transport van as they left work on January 20. The incident occurred after sustained threats by the Taliban on the news outlet for its media coverage of the Taliban takeover of Kunduz the year prior. Another 25 civilians were wounded in the same attack.

The situation in India has also deteriorated in the past 12-18 months, with five journalists killed in 2016, taking the total to 40 in the past five years. What is becoming clear in the case of India is that despite being the world’s biggest democracy, freedom of expression and critical reporting increasingly has a murderous price.

IFJ Director – Program & Development, Jane Worthington, said: “Across the Asia Pacific region, 28 journalists and media workers lost their lives on duty in 2016 – accounting for a quarter of all media deaths recorded by IFJ globally in the year. Most were gunned down in direct attacks. Many of them were reporting on the toughest issues: illegal mining and forestry, corruption, black market activities, political and criminal mafia operations.”

Hard-fought wins have been achieved in Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Pakistan in the past 12 months which give hope about the continued work across the globe. The reopening of investigations into the murder of Lasantha Wickremetunge in Sri Lanka; and convictions in the murders of Ayub Khattak in Pakistan and Desiderio Camangyan in the Philippines, illustrate what can be achieved through consistent campaigns, solidarity action and collaborative effort.

“But as long as these are the exception rather than the rule and we continue to lose a journalist to murder every 13 days, we still have the greatest challenges before us,” said the IFJ. - IFJ media release",Q2
https://everything2.com:443/user/Christopher+Vo/writeups/Separation+of+Powers,Separation of Powers (thing) by Christopher Vo,"Here's a short essay I wrote for my Government 103 class on the separation of powers.INTRODUCTIONIn 1786, Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams , ""The first principle of a good government is certainly a distribution of its powers into executive judiciary , and legislative , and a subdivision of the latter into two or three branches."" In this statement, Jefferson is referring to the technique of horizontal distribution of powers , or the separation of powers into three branches within the government, outlined in the Constitution of the United States of America . This feature, along with a vertical division of powers also known as federalism, and a system of checks and balances between the horizontal powers, are integral parts of the modus operandi of the United States Such features are implemented for two major reasons. The first reason that a separation of powers is used in a government is to prevent the corruption of the democracy by inhibiting a single power from gaining excessive power and becoming dictatorial . The second reason for a separation of powers is that a government with separation of powers is more constrained, making it less likely to become tyrannical and more likely to operate within the law.Since the government is more constrained, an implication of a separation of powers and checks and balances in the United States is that they diminish the efficacy and efficiency of the government because they increase the possibility of governmental paralysis . That is, if there is a disagreement on the fundamental objectives of the government, the entire operation of government could theoretically stall.Because of the implications involved with separation of powers , there are some ""innovations"" that the branches of the United States government use in order to become less interdependent on each other and re-balance the powers in their favor. An example of such an innovation is the power of judicial review , which has been stretched to absurd proportions and has essentially given the judiciary the power to unofficially change the law. Another example of such an innovation is the President's ability to issue executive orders on particular issues, which supercede congressional consent and have the same effect as laws.This essay will examine the reasons and origin of the doctrine of separation of powers in the United States, the implications of a such a system, changes and innovations that have been made to the system over the years, and the implications of those changes to the system. Furthermore, the essay will detail the implications that the doctrine of separation of powers has had on citizens and their rights in the United States.

SEPARATION OF POWERS IN THE UNITED STATES



The first three articles of the Constitution of the United States of America outline the powers of the three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary respectively.



The reason for the separation of powers was exclusively to diminish the arbitrary power of unchecked rulers. However, another reason behind the use of separation of powers is the belief that under a separation of powers, a government is more likely to stay within the rule of law, given each power checks and balances the others. Thus, separation of powers is related to the idea of checks and balances, where the branches have overlapping authority within the United States government, and the people have the rights to criticize the state actions and remove members from office.

ORIGIN OF THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS



The idea of separation of powers is a derivative of the ideas of early philosophers Aristotle, Plato, and Niccolò Machiavelli, whose ideas English scholar James Harrington interpreted in his essay Commonwealth of Oceana in 1656, describing a utopian political system with a separation of powers. Another English theorist, John Locke, argued that the executive and legislative powers of government were conceptually different but there was no need for separation, and his ideas did not include judicial powers. The modern idea of separation of powers comes from a French political writer, Baron Montesquieu, who outlined a three-way division of powers in England with Parliament, the king, and the courts. However, Montesquieu believed that a monarch should exercise executive power, not an elected representative, the converse of how the United States government works.



CHANGE IN POWER IN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OVER THE YEARS



The Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, originally created only a unicameral legislative branch, with no executive and legislative branches. A significant reduction in power occurred in the legislative branch when the Constitution divided the power of the legislative branch, creating an executive and judicial branch.



Over the years, Congress has been trying to demonstrate its independence from the other branches of government. An example is in the Watergate scandal, where Congress asserted its right to investigate allegations of crimes by Nixon. However, the president has retained dominance over the legislative branch since the early 20th century, and by the end of World War II, the presidency was ingrained as the most visible political institution. The growth of the executive branch will be explained in more depth later in the essay.

THE POWER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW



There have been several significant ""innovations"" created that made changes to the original balance of power in the United States. The first of these innovations was the power of Judicial Review, the power of the courts to review and invalidate governmental actions that are unconstitutional by their interpretation.



The Constitution says nothing of judicial review, but it was anticipated that the courts would have such a power to a certain extent. The writers of the Constitution were aware of such a concept, and even before the Constitution was adopted, state courts struck down laws that they declared unconstitutional. Alexander Hamilton believe that without the power of judicial review, the protection of rights in the Constitution would amount to nothing.



The power of judicial review was clearly established in the decision of Marbury v. Madison, where Chief Justice John Marshall declared that it is the duty of the courts ""to say what the law is."" In the decision of Cohens v. Virginia, it was made clear that the federal courts also have to review and invalidate state laws that violate the Constitution as well.



The implication of judicial review was that in essence, the Judiciary is able to unofficially change the law. The Supreme Court has overturned over 125 federal statutes and 1200 state laws and municipal ordinances. A significant example of a Supreme Court decision where the Judiciary was able to change laws was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, where the court decided that the racial segregation of public schools violated the 14th amendment. Another example is Roe v. Wade, which overturned state laws outlawing abortion. This example is significant not necessarily because the court overturned the laws, but because abortion is an extremely controversial decision. The negative implication here is that justices have been charged with writing their own values into the Constitution. The positive implication here is that judicial review helps to protect the individual rights of people by upholding the Bill of Rights.

THE GROWTH OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVER THE YEARS



The power of the executive has increased over the years for many reasons. One reason that the executive branch has increased in power is because of the pressure in the late 19th century to the early 20th century to create more regulation of business. This increased the demand for government involvement in protecting workers and regulating business and preventing unfair business practices. Because of this, many government agencies had to be made by Congress and the executive branch to deal with this. This especially became apparent when Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced the New Deal, containing his plans for reform.



Agencies and departments - bureaucracies - under the executive have grown in number and responsibility, giving the executive more power over the years. The implication of the executive's increased power is that some people, like Republicans and Libertarians, are contrary to those in favor of government involvement. Executive agencies and departments directly affect the people in their decisions, especially those dealing with welfare, commerce, health, and education.



In response to an increase in power of the federal government, there have been attempts to undermine the involvement of the government in the lives of the citizens. These recent attempts in the Republican agenda by the 104th Congress were called, ""The Devolution Revolution."" Perhaps Congress was also attempting to decrease the power of the executive branch through their shift of power to lower levels of government.

A major ""innovation"" in the separation of power likewise to judicial review is the power of executive orders. The president has the power of executive orders, where he/she can issue an order that Congress does not have to approve, and has the same effect as law.



An example of this is in March 1995, when Bill Clinton, who was the president at the time, signed an executive order what prohibited the federal government from doing business with companies that hire permanent replacements for workers who are on strike. Labor leaders applauded this because Republicans had the majority in Congress, and feared they were losing ground. On the other hand, the republicans in congress accused the president of attempting to exclude congress from taking part in labor policy decision.



The implications are apparent in this example - since Congress does have the power to approve or disapprove these executive orders, the president essentially is able to bypass checks from the entire legislative branch.

THE NEED FOR SEPARATION OF POWERS: SUPPORTIVE IMPLICATIONS



Despite the negative implications of the separation of powers - such as the possibility of gridlock or standstill between the branches causing governmental paralysis, it is absolutely vital to the government. Almost all democracies have some scheme of separation of powers to some degree. For example, Italy has a separate constitutional court for reviewing cases dealing with constitutional issues.



The need for a separation of powers is largely apparent when the United States' system is compared to countries like China, or Russia, which were controlled by Communist regimes for part of the 20th century. Those governments are despotic and repressive, because they do not have a separation of powers, making it easier for the leaders of such countries to abuse their power. In his Notes on Virginia, Thomas Jefferson wrote:



""A very capital defect in a constitution is when all the powers of government, legislative, executive and judiciary result to the legislative body. The concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government.""

CONCLUSION

Separation of powers, despite the changes to the balance of power between the branches over the years, is an integral part of a democracy, of which the United States is a prime example. This interdependence between the branches and system of checks and balances is designed to protect any one branch from gaining too much power and becoming dictatorial. It also ensures that the government stays within the rule of law. Therefore, separation of powers affects all people within the nation.

https://www.arabnews.com/node/2065521/lifestyle,Bella Hadid continues to speak up for Palestinians on Instagram,"DUBAI: Palestinian-Dutch supermodel Bella Hadid took to her Instagram account this week to highlight Israeli violence toward Palestinians in Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem writing, “If you want me to stop talking, they should stop killing.”

The 25-year-old posted a carousel of videos featuring graphic clips of Israeli forces attacking Palestinian worshippers.

The post comes just days after the catwalk star called out the social media platform for shadow-banning her Instagram Stories when she posted about Palestine.

In a lengthy caption, the model, daughter of real estate developer Mohamed Hadid, whose family fled Palestine as refugees in 1948, accused Instagram again of trying to silence her, writing: “If you really would like to silence me, just like the journalists, or really anyone trying to educate about Palestine, Instagram, I will continue to come forward with peace, showing factual information about how the [Israel Defense Forces], Israeli government and Settlers attack innocent Palestinians for no reason, except for simply being Palestinian.”

She continued: “I am not here to make this up. Believe me, I do not want to have to post this kind of terror. These are not actors. These are real IDF soldiers (who are supposed to protect) and real Palestinian people, with lives, families, jobs, history and souls. If you want me to stop talking, they should stop killing.

“The excuse I hear most is ‘the Palestinians. they were asking for it’ I hear, ‘they had a knife. That was the reason the soldiers started to attack.’

“Absolutely not. As you can see here, these are peaceful people, most of the time with their children, praying, or just…living. Sure, there can be extremists on both sides. (As anywhere in the world) But I will not continue to sit here and have my [people’s] name be slandered as if they are constantly doing something wrong to deserve this kind of abuse. Absolutely UNPROVOKED abuse. In their home, and on their land, that they have lived in for hundreds of years. Especially now, during the holy month of Ramadan.”

Not one to back down, the model posted a second set of videos, similar to the first, that included footage of IDF soldiers arresting and detaining Palestinians. She wrote in the caption that she will not “allow us all to be named terrorists.”

“This occupation is not only killing…many women, children and men on a regular basis, but it is tainting the name of other people in the process. It is saddening and sickening,” she wrote.

Hadid has always been vocal about her viewpoints on Arabs and Muslims and often shows her solidarity with Palestinians.

Last year, she joined demonstrations in New York City to protest the Israeli airstrike attacks on Palestinians living in Gaza.",Q2

Wade ruling was overturned on Friday.

The Dancing With The Stars professional, 38, told how she 'wouldn't be sitting here' without the procedure as she shared the emotional Tik Tok post.

Following the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade on Friday, the landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed abortion rights throughout the country, she urged 'we need to continue to fight'.

Opening up: Cheryl Burke has spoken for the first time about an abortion she had at 18 years old after the Roe V. Wade ruling was overturned on Friday

Opening up about her own story in the three minute video, the dancer solemnly explained: 'I am saddened by the news this morning and it weighs heavy in my heart because I had an abortion when I was 18.

'If it wasn't for places like planned parenthood, I would be a mother. And I wouldn't have been a great mother and I definitely wouldn't be sitting here with you today.'

Cheryl explained that she fell pregnant as a teenager despite using birth control, and opted to have an abortion when she was two weeks pregnant.

Saddened: Opening up about her own story in the three minute video, the dancer solemnly explained: 'I am saddened by the news this morning and it weighs heavy in my heart because I had an abortion when I was 18'

Noting the 'traumatic' experience, she explained that when going for the abortion, she was met with protesters outside the venue.

The dancer described the Supreme Court's decision as 'taking away women's rights', continuing: 'Our bodies, our freedom, our bodies have nothing to do with anybody else, right? This is a decision that we have to make'.

'The fact that you're making it illegal for us women to make a decision about our own bodies, is absolutely insanity. What world do we live in today? It is nobody's business.'

Emotional: In the caption, she referenced the Roe v. Wade decision - admitting she was saddened

Shocked: 'The fact that you're making it illegal for us women to make a decision about our own bodies, is absolutely insanity. What world do we live in today? It is nobody's business'

Continuing that she was happy with her decision, Cheryl said she had 'no regrets' and 'no shame behind it'.

'What if you get raped? What if you get molested? What if it's unwanted in general? Now that women has to live with all that trauma? This is ridiculous. I'm so upset, i'm so saddened and I feel like this is a personal attack because of my experience,' she explained.

Reaching out to 'all the women out there', she said: 'We need to continue to fight, we shouldn't stop fighting for our rights as women'.

Shift in law: The power to set abortion laws has now reverted to the states, 13 of which already had 'trigger' abortion bans on the books ready to take effect when Roe was gone

Fighting back: And protests across the country have taken place, with protesters gathering at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles to show their thoughts

The power to set abortion laws has now reverted to the states, 13 of which already had 'trigger' abortion bans on the books ready to take effect when Roe was gone.

According to the BBC, an abortion clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas shut it's doors as soon as the court's decision was announced - as Arkansas is a state with a trigger law allowing an instant ban.

'No matter how hard we prepare for bad news, when it finally hits, it hits hard. Having to call these patients and tell them Roe v Wade was overturned is heartbreaking,' nurse Ashli Hunt told the outlet.

https://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/klamath-trinity-rivers-2022-salmon-season-set/Content?oid=23832415,Klamath/Trinity Rivers 2022 Salmon Season Set,"With the number of ocean kings destined for the Klamath River trending upwards, Klamath/Trinity river anglers will have a few more fall Chinook salmon to harvest this fall. During last month's meeting, the California Fish and Game Commission adopted bag and possession limits for the Klamath Basin based on a quota of 2,119 fall-run adults. On the Klamath, the fall season begins Aug. 15 and closes Dec. 31. The fall season on the Trinity begins Sept. 1 and closes Dec. 31.

On the Lower Klamath, from the State Route 96 bridge at Weitchpec to the mouth, 1,060 adults will be allowed for sport harvest. The section above the State Route 96 bridge at Weitchpec to 3,500 feet downstream of the Iron Gate Dam will get 360 adults.

The Spit Area (within 100 yards of the channel through the sand spit formed at the Klamath River mouth) will close when 15 percent of the total Klamath River Basin quota is taken downstream of the U.S. Highway 101 bridge. In 2022, 318 adults can be harvested below the bridge before the closure at the mouth is implemented. The rest of the area below U.S. Highway 101 (estuary) will remain open to recreational fishing.

On the Trinity side, the quota is set at 699 adults. The quota will be split almost evenly; 350 adults for the main stem Trinity downstream of the Old Lewiston Bridge to the State Route 299 West bridge at Cedar Flat and 349 adults for the main stem Trinity downstream of the Denny Road bridge at Hawkins Bar to the confluence with the Klamath.

The daily bag limit will be two Chinook salmon, no more than one of which may be greater than 23 inches, and a possession limit of six, of which only three may be greater than 23 inches. Once these quotas have been met, no Chinook salmon greater than 23 inches in length may be retained (anglers may still retain a limit of Chinook salmon less than or equal to 23 inches in length).

Klamath/Trinity spring salmon fishery

The spring Chinook salmon fishery on the lower Klamath River (downstream of the State Route 96 bridge at Weitchpec) and Trinity River (upstream of the confluence of the South Fork Trinity River) will open July 1 and will run through Aug. 14 on the Klamath River and through Aug. 31 on the Trinity River. The daily bag limit has been set to one Chinook salmon (no size restrictions), and the possession limit is set at two Chinook salmon.

Additional season information can be found on CDFW's ocean salmon webpage or by calling CDFW's ocean salmon hotline at (707) 576-3429 or the Klamath-Trinity River hotline at (800) 564-6479. All anglers on the Trinity and Klamath rivers must have Salmon Harvest cards in their possession when fishing for salmon.

Minus tides this week

Minus tides that began last Sunday will continue through Monday. These are some of the lowest tides of the year and could create a dangerous Humboldt Bay bar crossing. Local boat ramps will also be affected. Thursday June 16: Low: 8:09 a.m. (-2.3 feet); Friday June 17: Low: 9 a.m. (-2.0 feet); Saturday June 18: Low: 9:50 a.m. (-1.5 feet); Sunday June 19: Low: 10:41 a.m. (-.9 feet).

The Oceans:

Eureka

Boats have been off the water since Saturday due rough water. According to Tim Klassen of Reel Steel Sport Fishing, the Pacific halibut fishing was good prior to the latest blow. ""Boats were still working in the same 9- or 10-mile area, from the 42 to 51-line,"" said Klassen. ""The biggest issue remains the number of black cod that you have to deal with. There doesn't seem to be any shortage of halibut.""

Trinidad

According to Curt Wilson of Wind Rose Charters, the halibut bite is still good out of Trinidad. ""We had one tough day last week when we didn't get limits, but it's been good since,"" said Wilson. ""The best bite is still straight out of the harbor in 250 to 300 feet. The rockfish bite is red-hot, we're catching lots of black and blue rockfish. The ling bite has tapered off a little. The crabbing is really good and the crabs are an excellent quality right now.""

Shelter Cove

""Rock fishing has been really good this week, but the salmon are nowhere to be found,"" said Jake Mitchell, of Sea Hawk Sport Fishing. ""Some silvers showed up, so hopefully the kings are behind them. The Hat and Ranch House are two of the better spots for rockfish. When we can get north to Rogers Break, there's plenty of halibut to be had. We were able to put in limits on Saturday. Salmon fishing out of Fort Bragg has been wide-open since late last week.""

Crescent City

It's been quiet the last few days due to rough ocean conditions, reports Britt Carson of Crescent City's Englund Marine. He said, ""It looks like we'll see some calmer water the next few days. When the boats can get out, the rockfish bite continues to produce some good numbers. Either one of the reefs and the Sisters have been good. The big news of the week is a couple California halibut were caught off the rocks at South Beach. Hopefully we'll start to see them show up in better numbers.""

Brookings

Ocean salmon season opens June 18 out of Brookings for hatchery coho. Anglers can begin keeping wild or hatchery kings, along with the hatchery silvers, June 25. According to Andy Martin of Brookings Fishing Charters, there's lots of bait near the harbor and anglers are anticipating good fishing. ""Limits of rockfish and a few lingcod are being caught, but Pacific halibut action is still slow,"" said Martin. ""Sport crabbing has improved.""

Lower Rogue

According to Martin, the first few salmon of the season are being caught by trollers in the Rogue Bay. ""Warmer weather this week in the Rogue Valley could make fishing even better, as late spring kings are quickly moving through the estuary and blasting upriver. Typically, an early start to the bay fishery indicates an above-average run.""

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WLNE) — As Roe v. Wade was struck down by the Supreme Court Friday, thousands came out to the Rhode Island State House to rally for Americans’ rights for reproductive health.

Abortion rights are now to be determined by individual states, unless Congress acts.

Former Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders told ABC 6 News, he expects legal ramifications when it comes to people now being forced to travel out of state for an abortion.

“There’s really nothing specific in the Federal Constitution that guarantees women a right to an abortion,” said Flanders.

“It will depend on where people live and it may have some influence on where people live and where people move to,” he explained. “But there are other jurisdictions in the country, other states, that have gone the other way and basically enacted trigger laws saying if Roe v. Wade is ever abolished by the Supreme Court, then in our jurisdiction, we’re not going to allow it to happen.”

Back in 2019, former Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a legislation to ensure abortion protections in the state if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned.

According to the Department of Health, there were 2,611 abortion procedures done in the state in 2020 alone.

“It’s now back to the states one way or another to make a decisions politically, do they want to do this or not?” said Flanders.

But with states banning or restricting abortions, those looking for the procedure may have to travel out of state for it.

Dr. Ben Brown, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Brown University, said now more than ever, he feels it’s important to back abortion funds and support organizations that work to get patients the support they need when it comes to finding places to stay when they travel to seek care.

“Today’s decision really stands in the way of people being able to access the care that they need,” Brown said. “It makes it so geography is part of determining whether someone can access the support they need.”",Q2

They said Babis Anagnostopoulos, who suffocated Caroline Crouch in front of their baby daughter and then faked a burglary, would never see Lydia again.

Miss Crouch's father David predicted the 34-year-old Greek pilot would become a 'broken man' in a notoriously tough jail.

'No amount of prison time can ever bring back my beautiful daughter but I am just gratified that the court didn't believe the scurrilous nonsense that he produced during his testimony,' said Mr Crouch, 79.

'I am further gratified to know that he will serve his time in Korydallos Prison, the toughest prison in Greece which has one of the worst prison systems in Europe.

Anagnostopoulos will serve his time in Korydallos Prison, the toughest prison in Greece which has one of the worst prison systems in Europe

Conditions in Korydallos Prison A recent Council of Europe visit to the infamous Greek prison revealed the shocking conditions to which Anagnostopoulos will be subjected. Korydallos is operating at roughly 140 per cent capacity, meaning prisoners are crammed into tiny spaces creating 'volatile and alarming' conditions. The CoE delegation found one 9.5m2 cell was home to seven prisoners, who were forced to sleep on filthy mattresses and blankets infested with bed bugs, while mould was caked on the walls and ceiling. Such close-quarters living with awful hygiene standards is an ideal breeding ground for communicable diseases. Many prisoners suffer from myriad illnesses such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, scabies and even HIV, with heavily restricted access to healthcare. The delegation also said buildings at Korydallos holding between 230 to 430 people each were often overseen by just one prison officer 'who clearly was not in a position to exert any authority or control'. This means the prison is essentially controlled by violent gangs who physically and psychologically degrade inmates into doing their bidding. They are also able to obtain drugs and mobile phones to maintain contact with the outside world and threaten prison staff. The horrendous conditions have resulted in a number of protests and riots in recent years. Advertisement

'When he eventually completes his sentence, which many people think he might not survive, he will be a changed man, a broken man, far older than his true age.

'Now that his fate is settled, Susan and I can move on. I intend to change Lydia's name to that of her mother so that she will never be associated with this odious creature.

'I will ensure that he never gets to see his daughter or to have any contact with her whatsoever.'

Miss Crouch, 19, was murdered last May in the villa she shared with Anagnostopoulos.

Afterwards he tied himself up and told police it was the fault of Albanian criminals.

He wept crocodile tears in a service at a hilltop cemetery on his wife's home island of Alonissos, hugging her distraught mother Susan.

Anagnostopoulos was given 16 years for killing his wife, and 11-and-a-half years for killing their dog and perverting the course of justice.

He will serve his time in maximum security Korydallos, which is known for overcrowding, gang violence and housing anarchist terrorists. He will spend around 18 years behind bars.

Athanasios Harmanis, the Crouch family's lawyer, said after the sentencing: 'Caroline is now a symbol in the struggle against violence against women.

'I believe we had a fair trial at the highest level and we did not fall for the charade the defendant played for the 37 days after she was killed and during the court sessions.

'It was a heinous crime – he held down the woman he said was the love of his life for five minutes while she struggled in his hands but he did not stop until she was dead.'

Anagnostopoulos had begged for a reduced sentence, arguing that the murder was a 'crime of passion' committed after Miss Crouch had refused to apologise for pushing their then 11-month-old daughter off her bed.

He had told the Athens court: 'I pressed her against her pillow. She was screaming. I thought she had fainted [but] then I could tell she was dead because her eyes were open.

'I started crying, pulling at my hair and pacing across the room trying to work out what to do.'

The helicopter pilot said he decided that killing the dog, Roxy, would make his story about armed home invaders more plausible.

Officers who entered the home found Lydia lying next to her mother's body on the bed, Roxy hanging in the stairwell and Anagnostopoulos tied up.

A jury of three judges and four laypeople took an hour yesterday to find him unanimously guilty of pre-meditated murder, of killing Roxy and of two counts of perverting the course of justice.

Sources said Anagnostopoulos is sharing a cell with two other VIP prisoners, former Greek National Theatre chief Dimitris Lignadis, who is accused of raping three young boys and a man, and actor Petros Filipiddis, accused of rape.

Anagnostopoulos hid his wife's wedding rings and jewellery in the fuel tank of his motorcycle, claiming they had been stolen by the 'Albanian burglars' along with £10,000 in cash from the family home in the affluent Athens suburb of Glyka Nera.

He played the grieving husband for 37 days after the killing. So convincing was his story that the Greek government offered a £250,000 reward.

Expert witnesses, including the couple's therapist, Eleni Mylonopoulou, referred to the killer in court as a 'narcissistic psychopath'.

Greek police eventually swooped after realising that data from the couple's smartwatches did not tally with his story.

The fitness tracker on Miss Crouch's wrist showed her heart had stopped beating hours before the break-in was said by her husband to have taken place.

Anagnostopoulos swept her off her feet when she was just 15, flying by helicopter to Alonissos where she lived with mother and her father, a former business executive from Liverpool.

The pair became lovers when she was 16, and married without telling her family in 2018. Mr and Mrs Crouch won custody of their granddaughter in October.

Three top detectives were DEMOTED following the botched investigation into Caroline Crouch's murder over the 'torture' of an innocent man

By George Odling for the Daily Mail

Three senior Greek detectives were demoted following the botched investigation into Caroline Crouch's murder amid claims that an innocent man was tortured for a confession.

Giorgi Khardzeishvili, 36, from Georgia, says he was tied to a chair for four days and beaten as officers interrogated him about the killing which he knew nothing about.

Homicide chief Konstantinos Hasiotis, his deputy Theodoros Theodorou and extortion department chief Nikos Davarinos were all moved from their posts following the investigation.

It took Greek police 37 days to arrest Babis Anagnostopoulos over his wife's murder.

He had told police she was murdered by a gang of Georgian or Albanian robbers who had broken into their home and the Greek government even offered a £250,000 reward for anyone who helped track the killers.

When Mr Khardzeishvili was arrested on the Greek border with Bulgaria on May 14 last year, he was presented as the prime suspect in the murder and paraded outside an Athens courthouse for press photographers.

It took Greek police 37 days to arrest Babis Anagnostopoulos (pictured on Monday) over his wife's murder

Speaking from Korydallos Prison, Greece's largest jail, Mr Khardzeishvili told Georgian media: 'I was tied up for four days and beaten while they told me to confess to this girl's murder.

'I did not know what was happening, I had never even heard of this girl. They would take turns beating me very hard, my head was spinning and I had a concussion.

'When one got tired, the other would then start to beat me. All they would say was 'Tell us how did you kill her, how did you get in the house, how did you get out of there?'

George Kalliakmanis, president of the Union of Police Officers of East Attica, said: 'Caroline's murder was a case that shook Greek society because of its brutality. But for quite a while, Babis made a fool of us all; even the government, which put up a reward to catch the burglars.

'The investigation was not handled properly and there were a number of crucial mistakes.

'Evidence was not evaluated properly which could have led police to arrest Babis far sooner.'

It took Greek police 37 days to arrest Babis Anagnostopoulos (pictured left) over his wife's murder

Among the mistakes he highlighted were the fact that officers did not realise memory cards had been removed from CCTV cameras and windows had been tampered with from the inside.

They also failed to take the Anagnostopoulos's mobile phone from him until a week after the murder.

Mr Kalliakmanis added that no fingerprints from third parties were found in the family's home and Anagnostopoulos was completely uninjured.

Athens police said Mr Khardzeishvili was later charged with robbery. A spokesman added: 'The foreigner was found attempting to leave the country.

'It was found that evidence had emerged against him for his involvement in a robbery case against an elderly couple, at their home in Pikermi.

'For this reason he was transferred to the property crimes department of the Attica security directorate, where he was arrested under an arrest warrant.

'The arrested person was also examined by police officers of the life crimes department for the Glyka Nera case.

Sara disliked being called exotic; except that she was. Hugely so. Dazzling, elegant, glamorous, charmingly imperious, impossibly intelligent. And most of all, fabulously, hilariously, screamingly funny.

As an author, Sara was adored, respected, admired and even worshipped. In 1989, Meatless Days burst on the scene with the same explosive energy that Quratulain Hyder had sparked with her magnum opus, Aag Ka Darya [River of Fire]. Both women were uncannily similar, inspiring a parody that began thus:

Qurratulain hain adab mein dakheel

Jaisay mulk-i-Arab mein Israel

[Qurratulain has occupied literature

The way Israel has Arab land]

My friend Professor Tahira Naqvi wrote in her condolence note: “I don’t think there is a book cover that has ever made a place in popular consciousness as that of Meatless Days. I can’t remember a book from my early days here that had as much of an impact as that brilliantly written memoir.”

As recently as this January, Sharon Cameron — a beloved friend and an exacting professor of English — read Meatless Days and had this to say: “I so admire the complex way SS weaves together family and Pakistani history and the nuanced way in which the narrative moves in and out, and then back around and at an angle through subjects newly given contour and life. SS is a very gifted writer.”

Sara Suleri Goodyear (1953-2022) was perhaps best known for her memoir Meatless Days, but a close friend and collaborator remembers her as so much more than a professor and writer

I read this to Sara over the telephone. Pleased, she remarked that the only other person who understood her “narrative weaving” was her friend and author David Lelyveld who, upon reading Meatless Days, exclaimed: “It moves like a ghazal!”

To this, Sharon responded: “The ghazal is an apt image… she has a rare capacity — as much philosophical as historical, as much intuitive as conceptual — to see the coils, repetitions and undoings of sequence such that any event, person or phenomenon can’t be located in a single or unified time and place, but recurs and recurs.”

The book didn’t just impress readers, it often had a strange effect on them. Some identified with her experiences at a deeply personal level, almost claiming ownership of them. In 2004, the great Indian filmmaker Shyam Benegal and his wife Nira arrived in town and my friend Anita Patil (actor Smita Patil’s sister) took us out to dinner.

We were barely seated when the incredibly sophisticated Nira turned to me: “I was anxious to meet you, Azra. I’ve heard that you personally know the author I admire most, Sara Suleri. I’m dying to know everything you can tell me about her.”

Talking about a writer we mutually admired bonded Nira and me. When we compared notes on our favorite Suleri passage, we discovered one about Lahore that we both loved: “How many times have we driven down from Rawalpindi, fatigue in the marrow of our bones, to cross the full Ravi and then the empty Ravi riverbed, finally to see the great luminous minarets of the mosque rising in our vision like a gasp or a plea?

“Of course, nothing in the city quite lives up to the promise of such a welcome, so that somehow one is always expecting to find Lahore without quite locating it. I used to find it perverse myself, that aura of anticipation, until it occurred to me that the town has built itself upon the structural disappointment at the heart of pomp and circumstances, and since then I have loved to be disappointed by its streets. They wind absentmindedly between centuries, slapping an edifice of crude modernity against a mediaeval gate, forgetting and remembering beauty, in pockets of merciful respite.”

For a 2006 interview for Islamabad-based magazine Blue Chip, the questions were emailed to me — Sara was a total Luddite — and I transcribed her responses. “What do I miss about Pakistan? Well, the sound of Urdu spoken around me, the monsoons, the extended community that is signally absent from daily life in the United States. And even jokes about load shedding.”

She came to the US “in 1976, to do a PhD in English literature. At that time, my first love was the theatre. Had there been any viable, serious theatre for women in Lahore, I would never have left. But there wasn’t, so I came away, and chose to do the next best thing. The joke is that I had done my Masters at Punjab University [PU] before I arrived for a doctorate at Indiana University, and I was infinitely better prepared than my American peers. I whizzed through that degree with honours in three years! There’s something to be said for PU as it was in the old days.”

“First, I taught at William College … where I was barely older than my own students. Then I moved to Yale University in 1983 and have taught here ever since … my husband, Austin Goodyear … died of cancer on Aug 14 last year ... While one of his ancestors invented galvanised rubber, Austin had nothing to do with the tire company — he ran his own business, sailed a yacht he loved, and was perhaps the most energetic and engaged human being I have known. I miss him.”

She was a legend as a teacher. When my brother Abbas went for a job, the interviewer said she’d graduated from Yale and was fortunate to have had great professors who changed the way she thought about the world, and about her own life. “Most of all, a young professor named Sara Suleri.”

Once, I asked Sara why someone whose mind was as curious as hers did not gravitate towards the sciences. She said it was because she did not have good teachers. I asked if she’d had a good English teacher. She said yes; her mother. But she obsessed over my question. She felt that there are people with aptitudes in different fields than science who are nonetheless fascinated by it. When I explained any part of my own experimental work in oncology, she listened raptly.

After Meatless Days, Sara wrote Rhetoric of English India and Boys Will Be Boys to superlative acclaim. She and I co-authored Ghalib: Epistemologies of Elegance. One summer, after a full day of labour on the book, we relaxed on my porch. Sara felt particularly satisfied with our output that day.

The fading sun lit up her face, but I sensed an inner light emanating from her entire being. I grabbed my camera and took a hundred pictures, yet failed to portray even a fraction of her beauty. The picture here is from that series.

There was something ethereal about her that evening. We’d worked on the magnificent ghazal, ‘Woh firaaq aur woh visaal kahaan’ since early morning. I felt her face reflected the ‘Ranaaie-i-khayaal’ Ghalib imagined in this sher:

Thi woh ek shakhs ke tassavvur se

Ab woh ranaaie-i-khayaal kahan

[It was in imagining that one person

Now where is the grace of those lost thoughts]

Among her contemporaries, Sara greatly admired Harold Bloom. We asked him for a blurb. After reading the Ghalib book, he called me: “Azra, you say there are two authors, but there is only one voice.” He was absolutely correct. Sara and I had a great partnership. My job was to explain the sher in Urdu to her. We then consulted the 11 interpretations we had around us, debated the meaning, eventually settling upon the version we liked best.

Then Sara would say: “Now let me put this into difficult English.” I typed as perfectly formed sentences streamed out of her mouth effortlessly. I was astounded that Sara never edited her prose. She did the editing in her mind.

After four decades on the East Coast, Sara moved to Washington state to be close to her beloved sister Tillat across the border in Vancouver. I hadn’t seen her since the start of the pandemic, but we had regular phone conversations.

Covid isolation had done a number on her. In the last few months, she was in constant physical pain and could only speak for a few minutes at a time. She asked what if she stopped eating. I said she would not live beyond 10 days. She said she’d speak to Tillat about it. When she asked me to visit, I wasted no time.

Sara was excited to see me and my sister Sughra, her neighbour and friend in Boston. She was energised and talkative, feasting on crispy pakoras that she had Tillat fry. The afternoon we were to return, I was almost catatonic with grief; I knew I’d never see that cherished face again. Noticing my heartbreak, she mischievously sang, “Chup chup baithey ho zuroor koi baat hai” [You’re so silent, something must be the matter].

I could only respond with tears in my eyes. She rallied her secret resources to sit up, stared deep into my eyes and imperiously commanded: “Acha Az, now, no long faces around me please.”

That is the quintessential Sara we know and love. I returned home and read our Ghalib book as a way to feel close to her. This sher and Sara’s poignant words haunt me now as I write her obituary:

Kahoon kis se main ke kya hai shab-i-gham buri bala hai

Mujhe kya bura tha marna agar aik baar hota

[To whom can I even explain, the dark night of separation

What had I against a singular death if it did not recur plural times]

My friend is done with her anguish and rests in peace. She had the acutest powers of observation and could hear wordless voices. How I adored her, how I miss her. Long live Sara. Sara Zindabad.

Tread lightly, she is near

Under the snow,

Speak gently, she can hear

The daisies grow

— ‘Requiescat’, Oscar Wilde

The money dwarfs any income Hunter Biden is known to have earned while on a Ukrainian energy company’s board while his father was Barack Obama’s vice president. And Hunter Biden couldn’t curry favor with any foreign entities with a powerful White House position like the one Kushner held, when Donald Trump’s son-in-law was supposed to be representing the American public and not his own interests.

“It’s just a complete free-for-all,” Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in the Obama and Trump administrations, told Bloomberg. “The real concern here is that the public has no way of knowing exactly what favors someone like Kushner may have done for the Saudis.”

Kushner, a neophyte investment fund manager who was a real estate developer in his family’s business before Trump elevated him and wife Ivanka Trump to senior White House roles, reaped the massive reward even though a supervisory panel of the Saudi Arabian sovereign fund had serious reservations about Kushner’s new private equity firm, The New York Times reported.

The panel was concerned about “inexperienced management” of the brand new fund and found several aspects of the business “unsatisfactory,” according to documents obtained by the Times.

But the panel’s reservations were overruled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a friend of Kushner’s and the recipient of significant Trump administration benefits.

This was the same man whom Trump — reportedly at Kushner’s prompting — staunchly defended after American intelligence said he was responsible for the horrific 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump also approved a highly controversial multibillion-dollar arms deal to the country while the Saudis were dropping bombs on Yemeni civilians.

Attorney Daniel Goldman tweeted Monday: “I don’t want to hear another word about Hunter Biden. But I would like to hear about congressional investigations related to this investment” by the Saudis, he added.

Goldman was the lead counsel in the House impeachment inquiry against Trump after the then-president held up military aid to Ukraine while pressing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to “do us a favor” and investigate Hunter Biden’s work in his country.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1687152/uzair-baloch-acquitted-in-another-case-for-want-of-evidence,Uzair Baloch acquitted in another case for want of evidence,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court has acquitted the chief of the outlawed Peoples Amn Committee Uzair Baloch in a decade-old case pertaining to the attack on a police station.

Uzair along with Taj Muhammad alias Taju, Sheeraz Comrade and Sultan alias Johny was charged with attacking the Napier police station with intention to kill policemen during an operation against criminals in Lyari.

The ATC-VII judge, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex inside central prison, pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.

The judge noted that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Uzair. He acquitted him due to lack of evidence.

So far, he has been acquitted in around 18 cases.

However, the alleged Lyari gangster could not be set free since he is facing trial in around 40 cases pertaining to kidnapping for ransom, murder, armed assault on law enforcers and running extortion rackets under the alleged patronage of the Pakistan Peoples Party and police high-ups.

Earlier, state prosecutors Neel Parkash and Ali Raza Abbasi submitted that accused Uzair Baloch, Taj Muhammad, Sheeraz Comrade, Sultan, Zafar Baloch and Noor Muhammad alias Baba Ladla along with their unknown accomplices with common intention and object threw grenades at the main gate of the Napier police station on April 2, 2012.

Defence counsel Abid Zaman contended that his client was framed in the present case with mala fide intentions for ulterior motives by the prosecution, which lacked evidence to prove his involvement in the offences levelled against him.

The counsel pleaded the judge to acquit him of the false charges.

Not just from the man behind the lectern bearing the seal of the president of the United States, nor from the Senate majority leader, nor the governor of New York.

For sure, President Biden, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul all called for tighter controls on military-style weapons and hate on the internet as they consoled a city still grieving over the Saturday massacre of 10 people in the Tops Market on Jefferson Avenue.

But the families of those gunned down in a racist rampage by an 18-year-old Broome County resident, affected by Saturday's events more than any living persons, echoed the idea, too. After meeting with the president and first lady Jill Biden, and expressing their appreciation for their empathy, the Buffalonians called for an end to racism, curbing guns and ending hate speech.

""He showed empathy about our situation, and assured us there will be change after this,"" said Ebony Thomas, whose uncle – Deacon Heyward Patterson – was gunned down Saturday. ""I think there should be stricter gun control laws and making sure that people with mental health issues should not have access to guns.""

Indeed, Biden delivered the same message in the strongest terms, at one point his voice breaking.

""What happened here is simple and straightforward: terrorism,"" he said. ""Violence inflicted in the service of hate and a vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group.""

Hate stemming from the media, politicians and the internet have combined to radicalize those like Saturday's shooter, the president said. He especially noted those targeting minorities in the false belief that they aim to replace whites as voters.

""I call on all Americans to reject this lie,"" he said. ""I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and for profit.""

Biden seemed intent on delivering a definitive speech about opposing the notion that one race is better than another. He recognized that hate at Charlottesville in 2015, he said, and resolved then to run for president in 2020. He pleaded for its end, offering that America is better than those chanting at Charlottesville or the shootings in the Tops on Jefferson Avenue.

""White supremacy is a poison,"" he said. ""We need to say as clearly and forcefully as we can that the ideology of white supremacy has no place in America.

""This venom, this violence, cannot be the story of our time,"" he added.

The president said Americans can keep off the streets weapons like the one that killed 10 Buffalonians Saturday.

""We've done it before,"" he said, referring to the 1994 assault weapons ban that slowed their spread until the law expired in 2004.

But the president and Schumer, who authored the House version of the 1994 law, offered no real optimism on such legislation gaining approval from Republicans in Congress. Biden told national reporters before departure from Buffalo Niagara International Airport he would have ""to convince Congress to go back to what I passed years ago.""

""It’s going to be very difficult. But I’m not going to give up trying,"" he added.

Schumer, meanwhile, acknowledged to The Buffalo News on Tuesday that ""we keep fighting,"" but also offered no predictions of success.

""We need 60 votes. We need some Republicans to come over,"" he said. ""They've been intransigent, but maybe this will change their minds.""

Schumer also referred to his Monday speech on the Senate floor, in which he said, ""I called out Murdoch, Fox News and what's his name, Tucker Carlson."" The senator said on Tuesday he wrote to Fox News about Carlson and his espousal of the idea that immigrants and minorities are attempting to ""replace"" white voters.

""I said speaking out is not enough, you've got to stop this guy,"" Schumer said, ""because of this vicious, bigoted conspiratorial replacement theory.""

Dee Davis, sister-in-law of victim Celestine Chaney, expressed the same thoughts from a different perspective. She received Facebook messages of the shooter standing over her sister-in-law, then video of the shooting.

Facebook allowed it to be up for hours.

""That should have been shut down,"" she added. “The video I didn't want to watch – I wake up seeing the shooting, of him shooting her in the head and finishing her off.”

Hochul, meanwhile, reiterated the strong language she has employed since Saturday calling for a curb on ""military-style weapons"" and hate speech permeating the internet.

""You could have that hate in your heart and you can sit in your house and ferment these evil thoughts, but you can't act on it unless you have a weapon,"" she said. ""And that's the intersection of these two crises in our nation right now; the mainstreaming of the hate speech and the racism and everything else that brought that person to this point, but also the access to military-style weapons and magazines. It is that lethal combination that resulted in the loss of 10 decent, good people.""

Jill Biden, Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Rep. Brian Higgins and Mayor Byron W. Brown also delivered remarks before a room full of about 100 people – mostly families of victims. They, too, called for change, echoing the final words of Hochul's speech.

""God give us the strength to forge ahead with the strength and conviction that justice must be done, but also changes must be made,"" she said. ""We'll all remember that it started here in Buffalo, New York.""

Ohio currently bans abortions after six-weeks of pregnancy. It's a recent change made Friday after Attorney General Dave Yost filed a motion to dissolve the injunction on Senate Bill 23, otherwise known as the state's ""Heartbeat Bill"" on the same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood.

Prior to SB 23 going into effect, the state banned abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy under Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The exception to SB 23 is if the mother's life is in danger, and there are no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. It also bans the procedure for genetic anomalies.

Dayton commissioners stated in the resolution that they believe ""the state of Ohio instead needs to take a fundamentally different approach, one that protects women and families, and specifically grants women the voice, dignity and respect they deserve.""

The commission called the informal resolution a good ""first step,"" saying it will continue working with the prosecutor's office and other city entities to figure out the next steps.

The city attorney's offices for both Columbus and Cleveland have already voiced that they will not prosecute under the state's current abortion ban.

On Wednesday, Ohio abortion clinics filed a lawsuit against the six-week abortion ban in the Ohio Supreme Court, calling it ""unconstitutional."" The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Preterm-Cleveland, Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, Planned Parenthood Greater Ohio, Women’s Med Group Professional Corporation, Northeast Ohio Women’s Center, Toledo Women’s Center, and Dr. Sharon Liner, an individual abortion provider.

“This sweeping measure, which prevents nearly every pregnant person from accessing essential care, is blatantly unconstitutional under Ohio’s state constitution which has broad protections for individual liberties,"" said attorney Freda Levenson, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio.

However, Yost responded to the lawsuit and said, ""Aside from filing the wrong action in the wrong court, they are wrong as well on Ohio law. Abortion is not in the Ohio Constitution.""

Four Republicans and three Democrats make up the Ohio Supreme Court. The next steps will be for the court to hear arguments from both sides of the issue, and determine whether the six-week ban in unconstitutional.",Q2

Wade, as evidenced by a draft opinion leaked earlier this month. With the mainstream media being so fond of the movement and sympathetic to the pro-abortion side, the protests received glowing coverage as well as trended on social media.

The following morning, the Sunday shows provided coverage as well. ABC's ""This Week"" not only referenced the protests, but had on pro-abortion and ""devout Catholic"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to discuss. Pelosi also mentioned the protests while on CNN's ""State of the Union."" And NBC's ""Meet the Press"" discussed the protests as well.

Coinciding with the ""#BansOffOurBodies,"" trend, Twitter users were invited to check out ""With fear and fury, thousands across U.S. rally for abortion rights,"" by The Washington Post. The outlet published many more pieces about the protests as well.

There was certainly ""fury"" all right, as there has been ""rage,"" and other similar ""call to arms,"" including from public figures and elected officials no less. That ""call to arms"" line came from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot over Twitter last week, as Spencer highlighted. Mayor Lightfoot also referred to how Chicago will become a ""safe haven"" and an ""oasis"" for abortion in the Midwest.

Pro-abortion protesters have been harassing in nature when it comes to protesting at the homes of justices, and interrupting church services. They've even become violent, as they've firebombed and threatened pro-life organizations.

Democratic leaders and the White House have laughed it off or even said they ""encourage."" While the Biden administration did ensure further protection for Supreme Court justices on Thursday, it came after much pressure from Republicans.

A simple search of the ""#BansOffOurBodies"" trend on Twitter for Sunday morning brings up vulgar and even inciting signs and tweets.

A particularly crude and popular sign making the rounds on social media, referring to ""blowjobs"" as ""cannibalism,"" also reflected a basic denial of biology by mocking those who call out abortion as murder. A human life is not involved until the sperm fertilizes the egg at the moment of conception. The sign was even shared by a state representative.

Many of these protesters claim they can't believe they have to march for this, well, we can't believe we have to explain this.

As Alex Christy highlighted for NewsBusters on the Saturday morning of the protests, the major media outlets were much more likely to hype and promote the pro-abortion protests, while pro-lifers were more of an afterthought.

NewsBusters has also year after year highlighted how the annual March for Life that has occurred every year to commemorate the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, is always dealt the short end of the stick when it comes to fair and equal coverage, or really any coverage at all. This was even the case in 2020, when then President Donald Trump became the first sitting president to make an appearance at the event.

Snakes always look for a nice warm place to hang out, and for one slithering serpent in Georgia, that place just happened to be behind the deep fryer inside a Sonic restaurant.

Sonic employees were cooking up burgers and chili cheese tots when all of a sudden they noticed a snake rear its head out from behind the deep fryer. The workers understandably freaked out and sprinted out of the kitchen. They called police and officers arrived to find workers gathered together in the parking lot. They described the snake as brown with diamonds on its back, and when the officer checked it out, he knew right away it was a non-venomous ball python and not a rattlesnake. He carefully removed it and gave it to a friend who has pet snaked. It's believed the snake crawled in through an open door looking for a warm place. (The Brunswick News)

Leo Fotu, 22, was killed after leaving a club near S Washington and 2nd Ave South. The shooting happening just days before he was scheduled to start his service with the Marine Corps.

His mom, Denise Frost, said Leo Fotu was from San Francisco and was visiting relatives in Seattle when the shooting happened.

""He didn’t deserve to be shot,"" said Frost. ""It just feels like a dream. Every day that I wake up, I think I’m going to see my son, and it just hits me that he’s gone.""

After she got the tragic news, she traveled to Seattle from San Francisco to try to figure out what happened, taking a picture of the spot where she said he had fallen after being gunned down.

""He was murdered, you know, and it’s just so hard to not know what is going on,"" she said.

Denise said Leo went to Seattle to visit his cousins for one last weekend before he set out for Marine Corps training on April 14.

""He was going to go to boot camp. So, that’s the reason why he went to Seattle, because he wanted to see his cousins,"" she said.

Denise said Leo had gone to the club with her niece. She said when the group went outside, a man reportedly confronted Leo and at some point, pulled a gun.

""I just want people who were there to come forward and tell their story about what happened,"" said Frost. ""If they have seen who shot my son, that information could help a lot. I just want justice for Leo.""

Denise said Leo has a sister and three brothers. He'd recently taken a road trip to Los Angeles with some of his siblings.

""They really treasure those last moments,"" said Denise. ""He was just a good vibe to be around, and a lot of people loved that about him. He had a big, beautiful smile.""

Denise said Leo had hoped to serve in the military alongside his younger brother, Fasi, who was also trying to enlist.

Leo is just the latest victim gun violence that includes more than 173 reported shootings and shots fired so far in Seattle in 2022, according to the city's online dashboard on crime. That is nearly a 90% jump over the same time last year.

As for the Pioneer Square neighborhood, online city crime mapping data shows there have been several reports of theft and larceny and around five reports of assaults in the Pioneer Square area over the past week alone.

Denise is worried about his case getting lost in an ongoing stack of cases, and is making a plea to the public and detectives to catch his killer.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/05/03/brief-lesson-roe-v-wade/,A brief lesson on Roe v. Wade,"(This is an updated version of a piece published earlier this year before the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade on June 24.) Roe v. Wade, the historic 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the first trimester of a woman’s pregnancy, was struck down by the conservative majority on Friday, taking away for the first time a constitutional right that had been extended to Americans for half a century. States can now decide to ban abortion; 13 states have “trigger bans,” designed to take effect the moment Roe was overturned, and a number of other Republican-led states are expected to move to ban abortion as well.

The following background on the case comes from the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia with a congressional charter to disseminate information about the U.S. Constitution on a nonpartisan basis:

Advertisement

On Jan. 22, 1973, the Supreme Court handed down a decision that continues to divide the nation. In Roe v. Wade, the court ruled that a state law that banned abortions except to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. The decision has proved to be one of the most controversial cases in the court’s history.

Norma L. McCorvey discovered that she was pregnant in June 1969. It was to be her third child, but McCorvey wished to have an abortion. At the time, Texas law allowed for abortion only in cases of rape and incest or to save the life of the mother. McCorvey was advised by her friends to falsely assert that she had been raped, but there was no police report to back up this claim. Instead, McCorvey attempted to have an illegal abortion, but she soon discovered that the authorities had shut down the facility.

McCorvey visited a local attorney seeking advice on what to do next. The attorney assisted McCorvey with beginning the process of putting her child up for adoption and referred her to Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, two recent graduates of the University of Texas Law School.

Coffee and Weddington brought a lawsuit on the behalf of McCorvey (who went by “Jane Roe” throughout the case to protect her identity), claiming that the state’s law violated Roe’s constitutional rights. The suit claimed that, while her life was not in danger, Roe had a right to obtain an abortion in a safe, medical environment within her home state. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas agreed and ruled that the law violated Roe’s right to privacy found in the Ninth Amendment, making it unconstitutional.

Texas appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and the case reached the court in 1970. However, the court decided to wait to hear Roe until it had decided Younger v. Harris and United States v. Vuitch. After the court announced the decision in Vuitch, which upheld the constitutionality of a Washington, D.C., statute that similarly outlawed abortion, the justices voted to hear Roe and the closely related case of Doe v. Bolton.

Arguments in the case began on Dec. 13, 1971. Shortly before that date, Justices Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II retired from the bench. Chief Justice Warren Burger decided that Roe and Doe, as well as the other cases that were scheduled on the docket, should go on as planned.

Jay Floyd, who was representing Texas in the case, opened his argument with what commentators have described as the “worst joke in legal history.” In reference to Coffee and Weddington, the female attorneys representing McCorvey, Floyd began by saying, “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. It’s an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, they are going to have the last word.”

The rest of the case was argued that day. However, as Justice Harry Blackmun was attempting to draft a preliminary opinion based upon the law’s vagueness in May 1971, he proposed to his colleagues that the case be reargued. After some debate on the issue, the case was reargued on Oct. 11, 1972. Texas Assistant Attorney General Robert C. Flowers replaced Floyd.

Blackmun remained as the justice selected to the court’s opinion following the second argument, and on Jan. 22, 1973, the court issued its 7-to-2 decision. In it, the court determined that Texas had violated Roe’s constitutional right to privacy.

Drawing on the First, Fourth, Ninth, and 14th amendments, the court said the Constitution protects an individual’s “zones of privacy.” Citing cases in which it was ruled that contraception, marriage and child rearing were activities included in these zones, the court found that the zone was “broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.”

Because the court determined that abortions were within a woman’s zone of privacy, it was ruling that a woman had a fundamental right to the procedure and that any limitations on abortion must meet the standards of strict scrutiny. This meant that there must have been “compelling state interest” in regulating abortions, and the legislation must have been narrowly tailored to meet this “compelling” state interest.

The court then assessed the state’s interests. Justice Blackmun found two legitimate government interests: protecting the mother’s health and “protecting the potentiality of human life.” To balance the fundamental privacy right to abortion with these two state interests, the court created the trimester framework. This solution determined when the right to abortion would be without limitations and when the state’s interests would be compelling enough to outweigh the woman’s right to choose.

The court said that during the first trimester, the abortion decision was left to the woman and her doctor. Following the first trimester, until fetal viability, the state’s interest in the mother’s health reaches the compelling level, and the state can regulate the procedure, only if it “reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.” When the point of fetal viability is reached, then the state could protect its interest in “potential life” and regulate abortion to that end. This includes banning the practice of abortion at that stage in the pregnancy.

In 1992, the court adjusted the trimester framework in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. In that case, the plurality asserted, under the 14th Amendment, that the mother had a constitutional right to abortion and that this right could not be unduly interfered with by the state prior to viability — what’s known now as the “undue burden” test.

Ever since the Roe v. Wade decision was issued in 1973, the case has remained one of the most contentious in the public sphere. It has inspired political campaigns and movements and sparked debates throughout the nation over ethics, religion, biology and constitutional law.

Michael T. Lloyd, 20, of Canandaigua, who was arrested as a fugitive from justice, has an active warrant out of the state of South Carolina for first-degree murder following the drive-by shooting death of Winston Hunter on May 13 in Orangeburg County, police said.

Lloyd was taken into custody without incident, according to Chief Mathew Nielsen. He was subsequently transported to the Ontario County Jail and is awaiting extradition to South Carolina.

Last Friday, a vehicle the Ontario County Sheriff’s Office said was involved in the shooting in South Carolina was located in the town of Palmyra.

A detective and sheriff's investigator followed intelligence on where they could locate the vehicle, which was backing out of a driveway at the time, Nielsen said.

Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenall did not immediately return a call for comment, but he announced on Sunday that Ethan Thorne Anderson, 19, of West Columbia, South Carolina had been taken into custody on Friday to face a charge of murder, three counts of attempted murder and four counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.

A 17-year-old whose name was not released has also been charged in the shooting, Ravenall’s post indicated.

“We had law enforcement across the country looking for these suspects, I said we would not stop until we found them,” Ravenall said in the Facebook post on Monday. “A child was retiring for the night after an evening with family and friends. And now he’s gone because of these cowards.”

Ravenall said in the post that some individuals got together and decided to ride to make a buy or robbery of marijuana.

“Now, 6-year-old Winston and his family’s house was shot up accidentally,” Ravenall said.

Ravenell said the investigation is ongoing.

Nielsen said Lloyd’s last address was Canandaigua, but that was not where he was located.

Nielsen praised the work of the sheriff’s investigator and Canandaigua detective, who were given limited information to start with other than a description of a vehicle, Nielsen said.

If one thinks about the number of vehicles being operated around in this area and the difficulty of being able to track one particular vehicle back to an address, Nielsen said that says a lot about the type of police here, their tenacity and their attention to detail to put together good cases.

""They really did do a very good job,"" Nielsen said. ""I couldn’t be prouder that they could help this community in South Carolina.""

Ravenall credited their work as well as the New York State Police and the United States Marshals Service for their ""tireless efforts"" on the investigation here.",Q2
https://303magazine.com/2022/06/william-review/,Rosen Captures the Essence of Blues/Folk Rock on 'William',"Will Rosenthal and his guitar frequently speak to each other. They hang out at music clubs in Barcelona, in corners of bars around 16th Street and on stage at the Fox Theatre in Boulder. They’re best friends — one in the same — a kinship that has developed through years of familiarity. On Rosenthal’s (known by his solo stage name Rosen) debut solo release, William, the guitarist/vocalist for Mr. Mota harnesses that energy into seven tracks that display a level of comfortability rarely found on introductory projects.

Rosen’s six-string chops are made immediately clear on the album’s opener, “Joey Song (Ride This Wave).” He reflects on “a world that’s fading,” but looks to the future with a relaxed flow, not unlike the waves he sings about. The tide he rides so effortlessly on this polished first record is a number of chords, split up by the glossy pockets of guitar fills — each one soothing and distinct. The following track, “Crappy Love Song,” is anthemic in nature — especially on the chorus — when Rosen delivers a humorous yet heartfelt message to his significant other. Above all else, his songwriting is rough in the good, pleasant type of way. It’s a true testament to honesty and compassion with the pen that displays itself throughout all of William.

The two records “The Wook (Under the Bridge)” and “Merritt Country Store” have shades of influence from American Beauty and Workingman’s Dead — a pair of early works by Jerry Garcia and company — all over them. Rosen lets his fingers fly on both, showing true respect and learnedness of blues rock that’d go over just as well on a front porch or a beach with no name. “So It Goes” is as easygoing as it gets on William. The chorus, a true highlight, puts the mind at ease with its drawn-out cadence and soft, beating instrumentation.

There’s an overwhelming sense of warmth in William that isn’t lost on the audience. While winding through the album, the smile on the listener’s face is most certainly shared on the other end of the headphones — Rosen was surely ear-to-ear during the recording process. His progression and talent are best seen live alongside his fellow bandmates in Mr. Mota, who frequently play in venues between Denver and Boulder, as well as a playing a few stops on a planned trip through mountain towns this summer. But first, give William a listen for a true taste of raw, organic love for a genre so firmly cemented in the lifeblood of Colorado.",Q2

Tammy Daybell’s death was caused by a pulmonary edema, or a buildup of fluid in the lungs which makes it hard to breathe, Fremont County Coroner Brenda Dye ruled in October 2019, Fox 10 reported Monday.

Daybell, 49, died at home in Idaho on Oct. 19, 2019, and her death was ruled natural. But now, investigators are taking a second look as the bodies around her husband, Chad, and Vallow stack up.

Tammy Daybell died in 2019.

Her body was exhumed last year and the Utah medical examiner announced in February that her autopsy had been completed, but the results have not been made public.

Chad Daybell has been charged with Tammy’s murder, while he and Vallow and Chad Daybell have both been charged with conspiracy to kill her, among a lengthy list of charges including the murder of Vallow’s children, 7-year-old JJ and 16-year-old Tylee.

JJ and Tylee’s bodies were found on Daybell’s property, which he was likely still sharing with Tammy when the children died, near Rexburg, Idaho, in June 2020, nine months after they were reported missing. At the time, Vallow was already imprisoned for obstruction of justice and desertion of her children after being arrested in Hawaii.

Vallow has also been indicted in conspiracy to commit murder in Arizona in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, who was fatally shot by her brother, Alex Cox, in July 2019. Cox died in December 2019 from what was ruled a blood clot.

Her jury trial is scheduled to begin in Boise on Oct. 11, with a scheduled completion date of Dec. 16, according to paperwork filed last week. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges.",Q2
https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/05/24/maryland-protest-law-berrigan-brothers-rumsfeld/,"An ex-priest, a flier and the arrest that legalized protests at Md. homes","Four decades ago, Phillip Schuller stumbled into history, joining a demonstration that involved an ex-priest, 10 pints of blood and Donald H. Rumsfeld’s front lawn. Schuller’s 1976 arrest ultimately upended Maryland’s law banning protests outside private residences. And it’s a key reason why, today, abortion rights activists can picket in front of the suburban Maryland homes of conservative Supreme Court justices.

“It’s correct to say that thanks to him, they’re not getting arrested,” said David Rocah, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland.

“I was young and crazy then,” Schuller, now 68, reflected last week from his Pittsburgh home.

In the spring of 1976, Schuller was an impetuous sociology major at Slippery Rock State College in western Pennsylvania. He saw a bulletin-board flier about a nuclear proliferation protest near D.C., he recalled, “and I said that I’m going to that.”

Advertisement

He stayed up until 2 a.m. baking bread, boarded a bus to Maryland the next day with no expectations, and found himself at a Catholic Worker House with some of the Vietnam War era’s most iconic peace activists, including the former priest Philip Berrigan, fresh out of jail for digging a grave in the Pentagon lawn.

Schuller knew of Berrigan and his brother Daniel J. Berrigan, still in the priesthood, who together had shaped the era’s antiwar movement through colorful, high-profile activism. Schuller saw older boys get drafted, watched antiwar protests on TV and narrowly avoided the war himself: It ended after he went for his draft physical but before his number was called.

“I was a little young to do much protesting against Vietnam, and I didn’t,” Schuller said. “But I was oriented and came of age during Vietnam.”

The looming threat and his Christian upbringing shaped a lifelong feeling that he should look for “the clear moral high ground,” he said. The flier on campus felt like an invitation.

Advertisement

But he had no idea the group would be so intense: The activists, he learned, planned to light a bonfire of tax forms and spray 10 pints of their own blood on the Pentagon.

“They were heavy,” Schuller said. “They were very heavy.”

Already, the Berrigans each had served years-long prison sentences for stealing hundreds of draft cards and destroying them with homemade napalm. After the war ended, they had turned their focus to pacifism and civil disobedience in protest of militarization.

A key part of the strategy, according to planning documents, was to rally college students against nuclear weapons. The April 1976 protest Schuller had happened upon was a precursor to what would become the pacifist Plowshares movement.

“Our country and the U.S.S.R. have enough nuclear weapons right now to destroy everyone on earth several times over. This possession in itself is immoral,” the organizers wrote in letters to Rumsfeld, who was then the secretary of defense. “The options for the American people are clear. To fight for disarmament or to dig graves.”

Advertisement

Ahead of the event at the Pentagon, the organizers held a four-day vigil outside Rumsfeld’s home, in the Maryland suburb of Bethesda. In a bulletin to supporters afterward, preserved today in the Berrigan Library Collection at DePaul University, organizers wrote that 40 people came, from Massachusetts, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oklahoma.

“As a paragon of power, Mr. Rumsfeld had to consider that his high position … does not exempt him from responsibility to our home family,” the bulletin said.

Schuller arrived midway through the last day of protests, he said, and wasn’t there long before the police showed up and said the activists had to leave. Most in the core group complied. Schuller did not.

“I just felt it was a public street,” he said. “It was just a spur-of-the-moment decision. I didn’t really think it through.” Arrested and charged with illegally picketing a protest, he went to jail with a few others for the afternoon. The man who would change Maryland law was absent for the main protest.

Advertisement

The next day, Philip Berrigan got arrested in front of the Pentagon, having helped dump blood on nine of the 16 columns at the building’s river entrance, and spattering a number of security guards, too. The group also burned tax forms, in protest of tax dollars funding nuclear weapons. “A symbol of death purchased by war taxes,” the bulletin explained, adding that activists had mixed ashes with blood and smeared that on the columns, too. This time, all 17 protesters were arrested.

Four months after that, Philip Berrigan was arrested outside Rumsfeld’s house with two other people. This time, they dug graves in the front lawn.

By then, Schuller had long since gone back to Pennsylvania and his life at Slippery Rock. He took over his dad’s construction business in Pittsburgh after graduation. He fell into a series of odd jobs, following the same urge to find something new. Eventually, he got into computer programming, and he largely left activism behind, spending his free time playing jazz gigs with his guitar and harmonica.

He would have simply left his picketing arrest behind, too, but the ACLU asked whether it could defend him instead.

Schuller was in Pennsylvania when he was convicted that June. At trial — in a question that foreshadowed objections to abortion rights protests today — the judge asked Schuller’s lawyer, “When is Mr. Rumsfeld supposed to get his rest?”

Schuller got a light sentence: five days in jail, suspended until he completed 10 days of unsupervised probation. But he and another college-age man, Sean Ozzie Simpkins, agreed to let the ACLU appeal their convictions.

In May 1977, deciding the appeal known as State v. Schuller, Maryland’s highest court declared state law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments in barring picketing in front of residences. Judges unanimously agreed the law was “unconstitutional on its face because it unreasonably and improperly impinges upon the defendants’ rights of Freedom of Speech and Assembly.”

Rocah, the Maryland ACLU attorney, said State v. Schuller blocked Maryland authorities from arresting people simply for picketing outside a home. Subsequent federal court rulings, he said, have reinforced and strengthened protesters’ right to be in a public arena, so long as they don’t stay still targeting a single home.

In justices’ neighborhoods, abortion rights demonstrators are marching.

“There seems to be a narrative out there that what people are doing is clearly illegal, and they’re just getting away with it,” Rocah said. “What they’re doing is not actually illegal.”

Some calling for an end to the protests, including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), have cited a federal law that prohibits demonstrations intended to sway a judge’s opinion. So far, federal authorities have not intervened.

Virginia, though, has an anti-picketing law that local authorities could try to enforce. Schuller’s legacy means Maryland does not.

“If I played a part in keeping an avenue of expression open, I feel good about that,” he said last week. But, for years, he thought he had been in the right place at the right time in 1976 for a different reason.

The night before his arrest, as he told it, the activists had held a Mass at their house. It was the week of Easter, and Philip Berrigan — that rabble-rousing ex-priest, that antiwar icon — needed bread for Communion.

Schuller was not Catholic, but he still had his 2 a.m. loaf. He offered it up.",Q2

(Will Katcher, masslive.com/TNS)

(Tribune News Service) — John Paradis trusted that the recommendation to close the Veterans Affairs hospital in Northampton, Mass., was faulty, and could be successfully contested. But he did not think discussions to shutter the facility would unravel so quickly.

A retired Air Force lieutenant colonel living in Northampton, Paradis was a leading local voice against the potential closure of the medical center, recommended in a March report by the Department of Veterans Affairs as part of a nationwide restructuring of VA facilities.

For three months, the possibility that the hospital’s services could be relocated as far as an hour away hung over the heads of the 21,000 central and western Massachusetts veterans who rely on the medical center. They worried that drive times for currently local health care would grow, that transportation barriers would prevent disabled service members from easily accessing treatment, and that civilian doctors were unprepared to absorb a massive influx of veteran patients.

By Tuesday morning, those fears had begun to dissipate. A bipartisan team of senators successfully blocked the appointment of commissioners who would review the VA’s recommendations on whether to shutter or relocate some of its facilities. The Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission — whose members required Senate confirmation — was effectively dead in the water.

“It was very welcome to hear,” Paradis said. “The facts and recommendation were deeply flawed, and if the recommendation had come to fruition it would have resulted in a reduction in services, which was not the intent, and that was unacceptable. It was so astoundingly rejected by so many people that I didn’t think it could make it through a laborious process.”

As mandated by the 2018 VA MISSION Act, federal officials reviewed the use of VA facilities nationwide and made an initial recommendation to close or move some of them in March.

Northampton’s Edward P. Boland VA Medical Center was one of the veterans’ hospitals initially slotted for closure, while other clinics across the country were recommended for relocation or rebuilding. Legislators intended for the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission to examine the recommendations and make a final proposal to President Joe Biden on how to handle each individual facility.

But on Monday, a dozen Democrats and Republicans led by Sen. Jon Tester of Montana agreed to block appointments to the panel. With the AIR Commission left empty, senators had effectively killed a years-long VA reorganization effort that began under former President Donald Trump.

“There’s a very positive message in this,” Paradis said. “Veterans and citizens, when you see something wrong, you need to speak up and make your voice heard. The veteran community said loud and clear that this would have such a negative impact on our quality of life that it couldn’t happen. That’s how government works, our elected representatives listened to us and acted on our behalf. To see this level of bipartisan support is really positive and good to see.”

The recommendation to close the hospital may have been fatally flawed from the beginning. The preliminary report on VA facilities relied on data that was incomplete and out of date, congressional watchdogs found.

VA Secretary Denis McDonough acknowledged the data issues during a conversation with Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern in May, the congressman’s office said. But federal officials had also overlooked considerable facilities upgrades at the Northampton hospital, McGovern told the VA secretary.

(Will Katcher, masslive.com/TNS)

On Tuesday morning, veterans and those who advocated on their behalf celebrated the news that the hospital would remain open.

“I was very happy, needless to say,” said Steven Connor, director of Central Hampshire Veterans’ Services. “I didn’t think that this particular thing, not selecting any commissioners, would be the way out. … If you asked me a week ago I’d say we had a really good argument, because the recommendations were built on faulty data.”

“It’s great news and I think a testament to public reaction and information and pushback against a large and bureaucratic and somewhat broken system,” said Bruce Buckley, chief executive of Soldier On, a nonprofit providing housing to formerly homeless veterans. “Sometimes the bureaucracy overwhelms logic, and in this case, it didn’t. … I’m glad that logic and process won out.”

Monday’s actions in the Senate were the culmination of a months-long effort to keep the Northampton VA running.

It began in March, when the initial recommendation to close the hospital was met with swift, vocal opposition from veterans and lawmakers alike.

“That’s a whole bunch of crap,” said Gumersindo Gomez, a Vietnam veteran and executive director of the Bilingual Veterans Outreach Centers in Springfield. “I don’t like any of it.”

McGovern and fellow Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal quickly pledged to keep the hospital open, committing to raising the issue with Biden if necessary. Soon, nearly the entire state congressional delegation was allied against the potential closure.

At a March 28 rally just outside the VA complex, veterans, nurses, lawmakers and supporters braved biting cold and flurrying snow to protest the hospital’s potential departure.

“This is fundamentally unfair,” said state Sen. John Velis, a Westfield Democrat and chair of the Joint Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs. “So many veterans use this place as a home. So many veterans get treatment at this facility. This is absolutely wrong, and we can’t stand for it.”

Some speakers described the struggles of commuting to VA facilities an hour away for treatment. Velis said his constituents would simply stop going to appointments if a hospital near Hartford was their only option.

David Felty, the president of Homeward Vets and commander of VFW Post 8006 in Florence, said “the mere thought” of closing the hospital has increased the anxiety of veterans who wonder what the future of their health care may look like at “private, for-profit” facilities.

“This facility is and always has been a vital part in providing care to the veterans in need here in western Massachusetts,” Felty said.

Throughout the last three months, veterans have shared gripping, heartfelt stories of their care at the VA.

Vietnam veteran David Keller struggled with PTSD and anxiety after returning home, but the medication he was prescribed wasn’t helping, he told McGovern at an April 20 town hall dedicated to addressing the VA’s recommendations. He said he felt lost and hopeless.

“Instead of committing suicide I went to Leeds,” Keller said, referring to the Northampton village where the VA hospital is located. “Without the Leeds hospital, I probably wouldn’t be here.”

“I handled Agent Orange when I was over in Southeast Asia,” Verne Sund, 73, of Greenfield, said in May. “I had cancer in my esophagus. And it just ate my … I couldn’t eat anything. If it wasn’t for that VA hospital, I would be dead today. They recommended a doctor and everything. They operated on it. And the doctors down there in Leeds were excellent. You couldn’t ask for better physical therapy and everything else.”

On Tuesday, advocates repeatedly praised McGovern’s efforts to keep the hospital running.

“This is exactly what you expect from government,” Paradis said. “He championed our interest, he held listening sessions with us. It was incredible to see the outpouring of support from the community at large.”

The congressman’s office said he planned to continue working to make sure other proposals to close VA facilities through this process would not move forward.

Both Paradis and Connor said that despite their happiness over Monday night’s news, the job was not done.

“We need to stay ever vigilant for the forces out there — and they are out there — who want to dismantle [the VA system],” Paradis said.

“Alright, well that takes care of that,” Connor said after hearing that the Northampton VA would remain open. “But it’s an ongoing battle and veterans get caught in the middle of it. I see it all time.”

https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/974203,"Biotin: Good for Hair and Nails, Bad for Thyroid Lab Tests","A sizeable proportion of people use cosmetic products containing enough biotin to interfere with several laboratory measurements, including those of thyroid function, new research finds.

The clinical takeaway, two endocrinologists told Medscape Medical News during the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Annual Meeting 2022, is that if an asymptomatic patient's thyroid test comes back suggesting hyperthyroidism, ask if they've been using hair, skin, or nail products containing biotin.

If they have, advise them to stop taking the supplement for a week and then re-measure their thyroid hormone levels. Chances are, they'll normalize.

The new study conducted in a rural Michigan family medicine clinic is only the second to examine the prevalence of use of products containing high-dose biotin (vitamin B 7 ), which interferes with a variety of biotin-based laboratory immunoassays.

In 2017, and again in 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about biotin interference causing falsely low troponin readings leading to missed diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

Biotin interference can also result in falsely elevated triiodothyronine and thyroxine, and falsely low thyroid stimulating hormone, mimicking results seen in hyperthyroidism (Graves disease). This can lead to unnecessary workup and treatment, with associated costs and side effects.

About 7% of Patients Found to Be Taking High-Dose Biotin

Jenna Bernson, MD, of Michigan State University, presented a poster at the AACE meeting detailing the new findings from a survey of 249 people seen at the rural Michigan clinic.

In all, 7.2% reported taking more than 5 mg daily of biotin. That proportion is similar to the 7.7% previously reported in an outpatient setting and 7.4% as indicated by serum levels of patients who presented to an emergency department, both reported in 2018 in a single paper from the Mayo Clinic.

Study coauthor Saleh Aldasouqi, MD, also of Michigan State University, told Medscape Medical News: ""We know people take biotin as a hair product, a skin product, and as an energy supplement...Our hypothesis was that maybe biotin use might be less in rural women, but it's about the same.""

The biotin dose found in vitamin supplements, about 50 µg, is roughly the daily requirement for the human body and doesn't typically interfere with lab results.

The problem comes with the far higher doses used in cosmetic products, Aldasouqi said. ""The typical beauty tablet has 5 to 10 mg, so taken twice a day, that's 10,000 µg. That is what would interfere with the labs.""

Advise Patients to Stop Taking Biotin a Week Before Lab Work

""It's very important that we ask our patients about biotin,"" added Cheryl Rosenfeld, DO, an endocrinologist in private practice in Parsippany, New Jersey.

""I tell my patients, if it's helping you and it's growing your hair and nails and you look great, by all means, you can take it. You just have to stop it a week before you get your labs done, just to be safe,"" she told Medscape Medical News.

Indeed, Aldasouqi said that although some guidelines — including guidance from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry — suggest stopping biotin 3 days in advance of lab work, ""that's not enough. It's easier for patients to remember a week.""

Rosenfeld also pointed out that women aren't the only ones taking biotin for beauty. ""Biotin products are marketed to men for beard thickening...There are preparations for hair, skin, and [for] nails for men and women.""

Interference Varies by Laboratory

The survey was distributed in a family medicine rural health clinic in Alma, Michigan, with a population of about 9000. Of a total of 264 patients who filled out surveys between March 2021 and January 2022, 66.3% were women. Among 249 with complete survey data, 20.4% reported taking biotin-containing products, and of these, 87% were women.

Of the 54 patients who reported taking biotin, 17 (31.5%) patients — 6.8% of the total 249 patients — reported taking daily doses of more than 5 mg.

In addition to asking patients about their biotin use, ""it is prudent to be familiar with the local laboratory and what tests are susceptible to biotin interference at each facility,"" the researchers note in their poster.

Indeed, Rosenfeld said, ""Some labs are better than others. The assays differ. Some may work better, but in others, the interference is so bad.""

Aldasouqi noted that Abbott Laboratories' tests are not affected by biotin. The company did not fund this study, although he now consults for them.

Rosenfeld, who practices in suburban New Jersey, said: ""You can't go a mile without tripping over a nail salon where I live. So basically, I see [biotin use] a lot. If I were to repeat [the Michigan] study, I'm sure it would be higher.""

Aldasouqi consults for Abbott Laboratories. Bernson and Rosenfeld have reported no relevant financial relationships.

A Texas Army National Guard soldier who went missing Friday during a rescue mission along the border with Mexico has not yet been found, according to a release from the Texas Military Department (TMD).

Local law enforcement on Friday said the guard member tried to rescue a woman who was crossing the Rio Grande River near Eagle Pass, Texas, and “never came up,” according to CNN’s reporting.

In an updated release on Saturday, the TMD said the soldier “selflessly attempted” to help two migrants who appeared to be drowning as they illegally crossed the river from Mexico to the United States.

“Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and Border Patrol continue to support TMD with the Texas Rangers as the lead for the investigation that began yesterday when the service member went missing,” the release said.

According to initial reports from the Texas Rangers, the two migrants are suspected of being “involved in illicit transnational narcotics trafficking” and are currently in the custody of US Customs and Border Patrol.

The missing soldier’s family was notified about the disappearance on Friday night, according to the release.

The guard member’s identity will be released “at a later date,” the department said. The search will continue until the department “exhausts” all available resources, the agency said.

CNN reported Friday the soldier was assigned to Operation Lone Star, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s effort to combat what he has called a crisis at the US-Mexico border.

The governor said his office is working “with the Texas National Guard and other law enforcement agencies as they search for the missing soldier in Eagle Pass.”

Florida prisoner Terry Mack has been charged with second-degree murder in the 1990 killing of Essie Camps.

Mack, 57, is already serving a life sentence after confessing and being convicted of the murder of Jeffrey Jones in 1991.

On Feb. 28, 1990, Essie Camps, 84, was found dead inside his Gainesville home by a relative. He had been stabbed multiple times.

Camps' murder was classified as a cold case homicide until 2019 when an inmate at the Liberty Correctional Institution in Bristol, Connecticut — where Mack previously served time — told the assistant warden that he had information regarding the incident.

Prisoner said he knew victim, his family well, visited him often

In an interview with Gainesville police and state attorney investigators, Mack confessed that he fatally stabbed Camps while he was seated in his reclining chair, according to a sworn complaint.

Mack knew Camps and his family well and visited the victim in his home often, according to the affidavit.

On the day of the murder, Mack told police that he went to Camps’ house twice that day. The first time was to borrow money for drugs, which Mack says Camps willingly gave.

Mack initially fled the scene on a bicycle but later returned and mingled with family members who found Camps on the floor.

Thinking Camps had suffered a heart attack, family members rushed to the home, according to a WUFT report, and soon discovered stab wounds.

Mack told investigators that he was high on crack and alcohol and eventually stabbed Camps to death upon returning to the home. He said he didn’t intend to kill or rob Camps when he returned to the house.

The Sun previously reported a similar manner of death — multiple stabs to the chest — in each of the Jones and Camps cases, which led police to suspect Mack in Camps' murder initially.",Q2

But today’s news sources – the mainstream ones at least, like what you would expect to be bombarded by at airports in addition to radiation – are all universally hogwash. The flow of propaganda and misinformation is nearly ceaseless. (We say “nearly” because MSM outlets occasionally have to take pause while they replace the latest producers to get arrested for sex crimes.)

As is so often the case in current year, up is down and right is left. A “blacklisted” news source is therefore one which doesn’t abstain from telling the truth, regardless of which political party or corporate overlord would rather it not come to light. It is a perilous role, to throw mud at the world’s most influential crooks, but someone has got to do it.

How fitting then that Blacklisted News does exactly that. This fearless cadre of journalists is absolutely vicious. It doesn’t matter how much clout some bigwig wields. If they lie, renege on their promises, or otherwise launch some assault against civilization and decency, Blacklisted News will point the finger.

Naturally, Blacklisted News’s quest for truth doesn’t get them much love from the corporate world. Bounty and Carl's Jr. and Toilet Duck are all eager to throw endless piles of cash at the MSM, which is thoroughly owned and controlled, but the journalists without masters have to go it alone.

In a new podcast series launched at the weekend, Irish Times journalists Harry McGee and Enda O’Down track down many of the players, witnesses and observers of those defining events of the 'GUBU' period of 40 years ago.

On a sweltering day in June 1982, a man got off a bus on Dublin’s City Quays near the Phoenix Park. The man was bearded and was dressed in heavy tweeds with a fisherman’s hat, making him stand out.

What happened next would give eventually lead to a political crisis so extraordinary, that it still resonates today 40 years later.

That man, Malcolm Macarthur, would carry out two brutal murders and trigger one of the biggest manhunts in the history of the State. He came from way outside the sphere of a usual suspect. He was the son of land-owning Trim couple, who cultivated a man-about-town image and dressed dandily in bow ties and cravats.

Macarthur had frittered away a large inheritance and - desperate for money - had hatched a plan to carry out armed robberies. Instead, he would carry out two senseless savage murders to get his hands on a car and a gun. The victims were nurse Bridie Gargan of Curraha, and Edenderry man, Donal Dunne.

The story took on a truly sensational turn when Macarthur was finally tracked down in the penthouse flat owned by the Attorney General, Patrick Connolly, the Government’s legal officer who sat at Cabinet.

Despite the shock of discovering his house guest was a double murderer, Connolly insisted on going on holiday the next day. It was an ill advised move. With rumours flying of cover-ups and conspiracies, he was hounded by a posse of reporters all the way to New York.

Charles Haughey, who had cut his own holidays short, ordered him back from New York and demanded his resignation, even though Connolly had no inkling of Macarthur’s crimes.

The subsequent fall-out led to a huge political crisis for a floundering government and made international headlines, and contributed to the collapse of Haughey’s government.

In attempting to describe the huge coincidences that marked the case, Haughey used four adjectives: Grotesque; Unbelievable, Bizarre and Unprecedented.

They were shortened to GUBU by one of Haughey’s arch enemies, Conor Cruise O'Brien, and quickly became the acronym that negatively described Haughey’s style of politics.",Q2

The deceased are:

Cpl. Nathan E. Carlson, 21, of Winnebago, Illinois, a Tiltrotor Crew Chief;

Capt. Nicholas P. Losapio, 31, of Rockingham, New Hampshire, an MV-22B

Pilot;

Pilot; Cpl. Seth D. Rasmuson, 21, of Johnson, Wyoming, a Tiltrotor Crew Chief;

Capt. John J. Sax, 33, of Placer, California, an MV-22B Pilot;

and Lance Cpl. Evan A. Strickland, 19, of Valencia, New Mexico, a Tiltrotor Crew

Chief.

They were all assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor (VMM) Squadron 364, Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) 39, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), and they were based at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton near San Diego, California.

“It is with heavy hearts that we mourn the loss of five Marines from the Purple Fox family,” said Lt. Col. John C. Miller, commanding officer of VMM-364, said in a statement. He added:

This is an extremely difficult time for VMM-364 and it is hard to express the impact that this loss has had on our squadron and its families. Our primary mission now is taking care of the family members of our fallen Marines and we respectfully request privacy for their families as they navigate this difficult time. We appreciate all the prayers and support from the strong extended Purple Fox family and want them to know that more information will be forthcoming on how to help.

The Marine Corps said that at the time of the “mishap,” the MV-22B Osprey and crew were conducting routine flight training. The accident is currently under investigation.

The training mission took place near Glamis in southern California on the afternoon of June 8, 2022.

Commanding General of 3rd MAW Maj. Gen. Bradford J. Gering said in a statement, “We mourn the loss of our Marines in this tragic mishap. Our hearts go out to their families and friends as they cope with this tragedy.”

In a separate recent accident that also occurred near San Diego, a U.S. Navy helicopter crashed, injuring one of the sailors on board.

An MH-60S Seahawk crashed near El Centro, California, on Friday. It was also conducting a routine training flight from Naval Air Facility El Centro.

All four aboard the aircraft survived, with one suffering non-life-threatening injuries and transported to a local hospital. The helicopter was assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 3 based at Naval Air Station North Island, California.

Yet another military aircraft accident occurred last week in California, in which the pilot of an F/A-18E Super Hornet was killed.

The Super Hornet crashed near Trona, California, at approximately 2:30 p.m. on June 3, killing U.S. Navy pilot Lt. Richard Bullock.

Bullock was assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 113 based at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, and was also flying a routine training mission before his aircraft went down in a “remote, unpopulated area,” according to the Navy.

The incident is currently under investigation.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/us/houston-tiger-victor-cuevas-sentence-murder-case/,Victor Cuevas: Former caretaker of a tiger that went missing in Houston last year is sentenced in an unrelated murder case,"CNN —

The caretaker of a tiger that temporarily went missing in Houston last year was sentenced to 18 years in prison in Fort Bend County on Tuesday in an unrelated murder case.

Victor Hugo Cuevas will receive 504 days credit for time served. His defense attorney, Michael W. Elliott, did not immediately return a message from CNN seeking comment Wednesday.

In May 2021, Cuevas was free on bond in the murder case when a 9-month-old Bengal tiger was seen wandering a west Houston residential neighborhood. As neighbors fled indoors and police responded, Cuevas came out of his house and pleaded with one deputy to not shoot and kill the tiger, known by the name India.

Cuevas said, “That is my tiger,” approached the tiger, grabbed it by the collar, kissed it on the forehead, and took it into the house, according to Wes Manion, an off-duty deputy from Waller County who lives in the west Houston neighborhood where the incident happened.

Manion said he watched Cuevas get in a white SUV with the tiger on board. He gave Cuevas numerous commands to stop, but Cuevas drove off.

Cuevas was arrested the next day and posted bond, yet was arrested again later that week for violating bond conditions. A judge revoked Cuevas’ original bond, increasing it to $300,000. Cuevas never raised the money for the higher amount and remained behind bars throughout the murder trial.

Cuevas’ wife, Gia, turned the tiger over to authorities after almost a week later, according to Houston Police.

The Cuevases were the owners of the tiger, Houston Police Cmdr. Ron Borza said. Victor Cuevas’ attorney had denied that, saying his client was taking care of the tiger for someone else, whom he declined to identify.

It is illegal to house a tiger in Houston, Borza said.",Q2
https://www.breitbart.com:443/politics/2022/05/06/vernon-jones-blasts-bidens-maga-remarks-calls-democratic-party-most-extreme-organization-world/,"Vernon Jones Blasts Biden’s MAGA Remarks, Calls Democratic Party ‘Most Extreme Organization in the World’","Former state Rep. Vernon Jones, a conservative Democrat-turned-Republican running for Congress in Georgia, labeled the Democratic Party “the most extreme organization in the world” as he recalled the party’s support for slavery and the Ku Klux Klan, as well as its current attacks on law enforcement and “independent think[ing].”

In a video posted Thursday, Jones blasted the Democratic Party after President Joe Biden attacked MAGA — the acronym for former President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

Biden made the divisive remarks Wednesday, as he addressed the impending Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade 1973 abortion case.

“What are the next things that are going to be attacked?” Biden asked. “Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history, in recent American history.”

While campaigning in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, Jones said, “We’re taking it to them.”

“They’re feeling the burn but I have to pause for the cause because when I heard that Joe Biden said that we MAGA folks — that we’re the most extreme organization in the world, I almost fell off the campaign trail,” he said.

Jones, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump in his run for Congress, expressed his surprise over the remarks “because Joe Biden belongs to the Democratic Party,” which he accused of racism.

“That’s the most extreme organization in the world, if there is one,” he said in the nearly 2-minute clip.

“[T]he Democrats were the ones who opposed freeing the slaves; the Democrats were the ones who started the KKK,” he added.

He also called out the president for showing honor to Robert Byrd, the former majority leader of the Democratic Party and an avowed Klansman who was once an “exalted cyclops” in the Ku Klux Klan.

“It was Joe Biden’s best friend, Senator… Robert Byrd from Virginia, who was the chapter president of the Ku Klux Klan,” Jones said. “And Joe Biden eulogized him and called him his mentor.”

Claiming “this is [the] Democratic Party now,” Jones noted it was “a Democratic Party who attacked law enforcement officers [and] who want to defund the police departments.”

“This same group do not want babies to be born,” he said. “This is extreme.”

The 61-year-old congressional candidate warned that Democrats “will attack you for being an independent thinker,” as he pointed to COVID vaccination policies to highlight what he viewed as hypocrisy.

“This is the same group that said, ‘My body, my choice’ when it comes to abortions but not when it comes to the vaccine mandate,” he said. “But what happened to, ‘My body, my choice’ then?”

Referring to “Mr. extreme” Biden’s comments against MAGA, Jones replied that it was the president and his party that were, in fact, the extremists.

“So when Joe Biden says that, Joe Biden is the extreme [one] and so is the Democratic Party,” he said. “And that’s why we’re going to take our country back; we’re going to take our state back.”

Jones, who switched parties in 2020 and endorsed then-President Trump’s re-election campaign, is narrowly leading his closest competitor, trucking company owner Mike Collins, in the Republican primary race for U.S. Congress in Georgia’s Tenth District, according to an internal poll obtained by Breitbart News.

In 2020, he explained why “a lifelong Democrat [was] speaking at the Republican National Convention (RNC).”

“[Because] the Democratic Party does not want black people to leave their mental plantation; we’ve been forced to be there for decades and generations,” he said.

“But I have news for Joe Biden: We are free people with free minds,” Jones added. “I am part of a large and growing segment of the black community who are independent thinkers, and we believe that Donald Trump is the President that America needs to lead us forward.”

https://www.ocalagazette.com/ocala-speaks-out-on-gun-violence-and-schools/,Ocala weighs in on combating gun violence and schools,"The following comments are in response to a social media post seeking comments to the question: How can we make our communities safer from gun violence?

Bethany Vetter: We could place metal fencing around schools with locks. As well as keep all doors locked at all times when children are in class. We could buzz people in that need to go to the office. Metal detectors at all entrances, coming in and out. Cameras. Guards on campus all day.

Joel Raney: What frustrates me most is the lack of action of our government in ANY way at all, because most of the people in power let their self-interest run their schedule instead of what is best for the greater good. Both political parties set terrible examples of how deals should get done and how progress should be made. All of the name calling and finger pointing, it is counterproductive. That doesn’t work in business, and it certainly doesn’t work in politics. We are talking about protecting children in our country, which should be of the highest priority, and yet we still see no results time and time again. That tells me something is very wrong with our system and it needs to change. Hopefully, we as a country can get past our differences and do what is right and what is necessary to protect our youth going forward.

Pursell Brent: I think we should offer tax breaks for retired military and veterans, who could then donate their time as armed guards. Money problem is solved. No taxes raised.

Ariel Burns: Gun control. Perhaps take a look at other countries who have taken action with reform like Australia. Prioritize/fund mental health programs as well.

Kristi Leigh Lemons: Improve the system for mental health. Personally, I believe that alone would solve many issues. But I’ll be honest, I don’t really have a clue on how to…it’s broken. Mental health individuals end up in the vicious cycle of county jail, over and over, until they commit a crime for prison time.

Jamie Colon: Automatic-locking doors. Armed teachers or staff.

Lindsay Gunter: My daughter attends MSA in Palmetto, FL. A man stands at our one entry to the school all day, armed with a gun. He is a retired combat veteran, trained to head straight towards gunfire. He also has survived being shot at in intense situations. You may not like it, but I promise TODAY when I drop my daughter off I have a tad bit more reassurance knowing her completely gated, guarded school has him. We don’t need to debate.

Beth Seavey: Security cameras and monitors where the person buzzing someone in can see their ID and have double front-locking doors where they have to wait and cannot come all the way into the school unless they are there for a meeting.

Rebecca Lambert: Mental health needs a massive change. It shouldn’t be so complicated to get someone help when you’re literally petitioning the courts for it. Yet they basically tell you, “Sorry, they’re not crazy enough.” And nothing gets done until something worse happens. Why wait until the worst happens? So many unnecessary deaths and violence at the hands of mentally unstable individuals who refuse their own medical care and aren’t “crazy enough” for the courts to step in.

Frank Peters: We need more officers at our schools. One person doesn’t do anything when you’re covering an entire campus that spans several acres. Need at least 2-3 officers. Their duty is constantly roving around the campus, not teaching classes, not BSing with faculty. Nothing but roving and looking for threats! We have a “safe school” officer, but our ignorant sheriff doesn’t want to give up any power and let the safe school become an armed officer. Maybe we should start asking questions there? There was a huge debate about this in Marion County a few years ago, and your sheriff was against it! Sure, it’s going to come down to money, but I bet you a shiny nickel you’ll have combat military veterans that’ll do the job cheaper than what the local agencies are milking the school board for.

Shari Beville Sexton: Every school must have one entry point where people are screened to get inside. I don’t think the school in Texas had this. Sad times bring desperate measures.

Meghan King: A gate guard and better fencing, just like a private community has. More school psychologists. A TRUE zero tolerance policy…

Lorie Marcillo: As a community, we need to educate ourselves about mental health and how to openly discuss concerns. The schools need to be funded with better security and better-trained officers. To have a retired veteran being a security guard that walks the hallways alongside other officers walking around the outside of campus. As a nation, you should be 21 years or older to be able to purchase a gun and ammo. I know people may think teachers should openly carry but I don’t think in that moment all would be able to take action. Anyone can have a gun, but can anyone be able to use it when it comes to the moment? How many more tragedies does it take for the school systems to do what NEEDS to be done before they actually do it? That’s my question.

Ricky Earl Jr.: More parent involvement. I researched an article…I read about a group of parents in Louisiana that took matters into their own hands and started a group called “Dads on Duty” to help maintain order in the school. This makes a lot more sense than having just one or two resource officers on campus.

Denise Higgins: People need to not be scared to speak up if someone they know or used to be close with starts exhibiting strange behaviors. Mental health is a serious thing. I’ve seen time and time again people that just don’t like to get involved in someone else’s life. You always hear after the fact that the kid that went crazy was bullied or had a very troubled house life. We need discipline for the bullies, not for the victims. It’s time we start watching over each other again. We should have laws and guidelines that help someone get noticed, and help. Though I know those things are far off, in the meantime, we can start by paying attention again. Pay attention to the kids around you, to the kids in your neighborhood. Don’t be scared to say something to anyone until you get noticed and get them help. We can’t keep turning a blind eye because it’s not our kid, not our problem, because one day it WILL be our problem. Sure, the gun laws need work as well; I can agree with that. But I am tired of seeing people pass the buck when it comes to noticing erratic behavior. We have to come together as a country, as a community and start helping each other.

Erica Lédée: Bank-like securities, such as a remote handheld, you push it, and all the doors lock, and an alarm goes off to warn everyone and the lights blink red.

Cheryl Reith: First of all, EVERY GUN/ASSAULT WEAPON in the hands of anyone except law enforcement and active military needs to be confiscated, and all gun shops should be shut down. People are willing to risk their children’s lives for the Second Amendment. It’s unreal. What IS real is mental illness, and there is NO way to filter out responsible gun owners from those who want to watch people die. Anyone can get hold of a gun as long as they are not out there in the [brandishing them in] public, and they do. Since this common-sense idea won’t happen in this falling-to-shreds country, at least schools can do more to protect their students and faculty. They don’t do enough. My son’s school has monthly active shooter drills. Not sure why though, because if I decided to sign my son out early, say last Wednesday at 10:30 a.m., I can walk in through the front door to the main desk in the rotunda and talk to them. This is NOT okay. Not one of these doors leading into the school/portables should be unlocked at any time. With all of our technology, we have plenty of ways to screen before allowing entrance. Police presence at the main entrance, Ring cameras at all school entrances and portables, metal detectors, staff-monitored access inside, high privacy fencing…the government needs to start investing in our schools…not worry about accommodating people moving into the state by the hundreds of thousands. But I have no voice except here in social media comments. The world we are raising our children in is just devastating.

Sanaz Sonya Nasser: Background checks and a waiting period for getting a gun (that would be a good cooling off period for the impulse shooter). Also, our school resource officers do not walk around with these types of weapons. Why should any person be able to purchase one? What is the use of one unless you are in the military or the police force for the everyday person to purchase a big magazine gun like the ones used in school shootings? If someone feels they absolutely must have one maybe have a better system of tracking and mental health background assessment and above all everyone including the salesperson should see red flags and report them right away to law enforcement. Locally we need to have a school task force that assesses the gaps in the potential vulnerability and rather than react during a national shooting work with OPD on a regular basis on an ongoing plan of action. We must help our police force.

Loretta Lucas: Background checks for all gun sales. Red flag laws. “See something/say something”. Support the idea that “turning someone in” is the right thing to do/it’s not being a “snitch”. Limit magazine size.",Q2
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/lake-mead-human-remains-found-las-vegas,Second set of human remains found in receding Lake Mead waters,"Authorities in Nevada have recovered another set of human remains from Lake Mead as a devastating drought has depleted the massive reservoir outside Las Vegas.

Two sisters paddle boarding in the lake on Saturday spotted the bones, which they initially thought were the remains of a bighorn sheep.

“For the longest time I was in disbelief, like I did not think that we actually found human remains,” Lynette Melvin told KLAS-TV.

After spotting a jaw bone, they realized the remains were human and contacted park officials. National Park Service rangers collected them from Callville Bay, part of an area that is popular for boating and other water recreation.

Las Vegas police said they are not investigating the case as a homicide. The Clark county coroner’s office is examining the remains as officials try to determine the identity.

The discovery came a week after dwindling lake levels unearthed a barrel containing the body of a man who authorities said had been shot decades ago. Police estimate the man was probably killed between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s because he was wearing shoes made in that period.

The Clark county coroner’s office is also trying to determine that person’s identity. Police said they planned to enlist experts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to determine when the barrel started eroding.

The grueling drought that has battered the American west has depleted the lake, one of the largest reservoirs in the US, so much that a water intake became visible two weeks ago. Las Vegas is now pumping water from deeper within the reservoir, which is part of a system that provides water to more than 40 million people and agriculture across the region. Officials have warned that the drought would probably bring more human remains to the lake’s surface.

“I would say there is a very good chance as the water level drops that we are going to find additional human remains,” Ray Spencer, a lieutenant with the Las Vegas police, said after the discovery of the first set of remains.

https://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2022/06/21/pelham-double-murderer-paul-leon-resentenced-eligible-parole/7684693001/,1980s Pelham double murderer eligible for parole after resentencing,"A 52-year-old convicted murderer from Pelham who bludgeoned and stabbed to death an 83-year-old neighbor and her daughter nearly four decades ago is eligible for parole this summer after a judge resentenced him because his youth was not adequately considered at the time.

Paul Leon, a model inmate at Green Haven Correctional Facility, was spared waiting another 14 years for a parole bid when Westchester County Judge George Fufidio on Friday sentenced him to consecutive terms of 18 years to life for the July 27, 1986, murders of Lois Feraca and Theresa Carbone.

Leon was just 16 at the time and would frequently make some money by running errands for Feraca, who lived in his apartment building on Fifth Avenue.

At the time of the murders, Feraca was recuperating from cataract surgery and her 49-year-old daughter was visiting from Ossining so she could take care of her. Leon beat them with a mop and stabbed them with three steak knives before slitting their throats.

He dumped his bloody clothing blocks away in Mount Vernon and later returned to the apartment to “discover” the bodies with his stepfather. Pelham detectives arrested him two weeks later.

A jury convicted Leon of two counts of second-degree murder the following year. Westchester County Judge Nicholas Colabella sentenced Leon to 25 years to life for each killing after lamenting that New York did not have the death penalty. He ordered the sentences to run consecutively, meaning Leon would not be eligible for parole until 2036.

After an application for resentencing last fall by John Lewis, Leon’s lawyer, Fufidio found that Colabella’s sentence was legal at the time but had subsequently turned unconstitutional because it amounted to a de facto life sentence.

The basis for that was a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Miller v. Alabama that judges had to consider five key factors related to adolescent behavior when sentencing teenagers. A subsequent Supreme Court ruling in Montgomery v. Louisiana made the so-called ""Miller factors"" retroactive.

The Westchester District Attorney’s Office conceded that the 50-year prison term was no longer justifiable and that it was unlikely Leon would lose an appeal if Fufidio had denied him a new sentence.

Relatives of the victims could not immediately be reached.

A transcript of the original sentencing shows Colabella was far more focused on the danger Leon might pose to society once released than on any possibility that he could turn his life around.

Fufidio found that Colabella may have considered some factors of Leon’s adolescence but not sufficiently.

“(He) did so without the benefit of more than 25 years worth of study into the elasticity of the adolescent brain,” Fufidio wrote in an April decision agreeing to resentence Leon.

“Meaning the sentencing court was bereft of information that could have helped it, if indeed he even wanted to, determine whether this Defendant’s actions, as terrible as they were, were the product of a transient immaturity that would not follow him into adulthood or whether he was irreparably corrupt and would remain a danger to society even after he matured which is the statistically less likely scenario by a significantly large margin.”

Lewis called Leon the “poster child for rehabilitation” and said he had the benefit of hindsight because he had proven in prison that he could turn his life around through education, a strong work record and beneficial programming. He commended Fufidio for “not being afraid of a defendant who committed a bad crime.”

The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision on Monday updated Leon's page on its inmate-lookup portal. He is eligible for a parole hearing next month and could be released then if approved.

Leon applied for clemency more than two years ago but neither governor since then, Andrew Cuomo or Kathy Hochul, has granted it.

In a video submitted with his application, Leon detailed the progress he has made in prison from the angry teenager to a well-respected, productive inmate.

He said he was conceived as a result of his mother being raped on a date when she was 17. He believed his troubled upbringing – including his mother’s frequent anger toward him – stemmed from that rape.

According to court records, although his mother also lived at 17 Fifth Ave., across from Pelham police headquarters, Leon stayed in a separate apartment with his stepfather. Both adults were heroin addicts.

He said he does not know the specific conversation with Carbone that triggered his rage but he responded to something she said by killing her. Feraca then came in the room and saw what had happened.

“I knew I messed up. I knew I did something so horrible that I didn’t want nobody to know, and I stabbed Mrs. Feraca,” he said in the video. “I am so sorry. I just reacted; me being scared. But I allowed my anger to control me and I killed both of them.”

That was a far cry from his insistence at sentencing that he had not killed the women and that the trial had been unfair. Colabella told Leon he was a ""smooth-talking, fast-talking streetwise kid who points in the direction of what is best for you."" The judge called him a ""brutal, vicious murderer"" and that his role was to protect society ""from the Paul Leons of this world.""

Steve Zeidman, a CUNY law professor who helped put together Leon's clemency application, suggested in an email Monday that time had proven Colabella wrong.

He applauded Fufidio and the prosecution ""for recognizing and valuing Paul's transformation and redemption.""

""He has done all a person could do within the confines of state prison to atone and repair, all the while staying fully aware that the harm he caused is irreparable,"" Zeidman said.

https://www.wral.com/durham-s-alley-twenty-six-first-of-its-kind-to-be-nominated-for-james-beard-award-category/20311816/,Durham's Alley Twenty Six first of its kind to be nominated for James Beard Award category,"DURHAM, N.C. — In recent years, Alley Twenty Six has carved out its own niche in Durham's blossoming bar and restaurant scene, a challenging enough endeavor for many places in a cutthroat industry.

This month, however, the craft cocktail bar will enjoy a national spotlight of sorts, one that no other entity in North Carolina has drawn.

Alley is a finalist for a James Beard Restaurant and Chef Award for Outstanding Bar Program, a first for any bar or restaurant in North Carolina to be nominated in the category. The awards recognize excellence in the culinary arts and hospitality.

Alley is known for its drinks and crafting their own soda, ginger syrup and fresh-made juices . Owner Shannon Healy says what sets Alley apart is the service that's worthy of a toast.

""We're just incredibly proud to get to carry the flag for North Carolina,"" Healy said. ""Being the first in this category for North Carolina, we get to represent other outstanding bar programs in the state.

""We're proud that we get to represent a cocktail culture in North Carolina that we believe in.""

NO TITLE PROVIDED

Healy came to the Triangle in 1995 with a different career path in mind, as he was then part of a band that wanted to be at the midway point between Florida and New York. He came to love the area and working in restaurants eventually struck a chord.

""Like many people in the restaurant industry, I got into this until my real job started and then you realize, 'wait a minute, this is my real job,'"" he said.

Healy was previously bar manager at Crook's Corner in Chapel Hill, another James Beard winner in the America's Classic category, for 12 years. In 2019, Crook's Corner was bought by a new ownership group, which Healy was part of.

Healy said Alley's opening in 2012 on Chapel Hill Street was a bet on the downtown area that paid off. The market wasn't as familiar with the style of bar that Alley filled and opening a nice bar downtown wasn't as commercially viable at that point. Since then, Alley has been joined by nearby acclimated spots such as The Durham Hotel across the street.

""When we opened here, it was still pretty early for Durham,"" Healy said. ""One of the most common questions I got was 'why are you here?' This was an upscale bar in an [then] empty part of the city. Well, hopefully it's not going to be empty for long.""

It wasn't. Healy said the growth of Alley was concurrent with the resurgence of the downtown area and the general population influx and demographic shifts the Triangle has seen in recent decades.

Healy's approach to bartending is a nod back at its roots of being a service-based job, with making the guest's preferences a priority and using them to craft something they'll enjoy. Being knowledgeable about what you're serving is important, but the core elements of the role can be accomplished by just asking what they like.

""I like to make drinks that you want to drink,"" Healy said. ""If you have questions, the whole idea of knowledgeable service is asking the right questions.

""We're not reinventing the wheel, but we do have to be good listeners.""

The COVID-19 pandemic brought many challenges to their line of work, prompting many hospitality professionals to leave the industry. Because part of the seating area is literally in an alley, the bar expanded their seating area outside and was in a unique position.

""A lot of times we're starting with people who certainly have never worked in a craft cocktail bar, but some of them have never worked in a nicer restaurant or even a restaurant. It's an interesting time to do this.""

PHILADELPHIA, May 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Breakthrough Properties, a leading global developer of life sciences real estate backed by a joint venture of Tishman Speyer and Bellco Capital, today announced the acquisition and development of the 2300 Market Street block in Philadelphia’s Center City district. Breakthrough plans to redevelop the site to support over 200,000 square feet of best-in-class life science space.

Greater Philadelphia ranks first in the nation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant Funding for cell and gene therapy and has attracted over $3.8 billion in venture capital and NIH funding in 2021. The city is home to more than 730,000 professionals who hold degrees in engineering and science fields.

The Center City submarket, and 2300 Market in particular, are well positioned to capture the intense and growing demand for modern lab space throughout Philadelphia that cannot currently be met by the existing supply-constrained life science market.

https://www.pressherald.com/2022/05/02/report-draft-opinion-suggests-high-court-will-overturn-roe-v-wade/,Draft opinion suggests U.S. Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade,"WASHINGTON — A draft opinion suggests the U.S. Supreme Court could be poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a Politico report released Monday.

A decision to overrule Roe would lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states and could have huge ramifications for this year’s elections. But it’s unclear if the draft represents the court’s final word on the matter — opinions often change in ways big and small in the drafting process.

Whatever the outcome, the Politico report represents an extremely rare breach of the court’s secretive deliberation process, and on a case of surpassing importance.

“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” the draft opinion states. It was signed by Justice Samuel Alito, a member of the court’s 6-3 conservative majority who was appointed by former President George W. Bush.

The document was labeled a “1st Draft” of the “Opinion of the Court” in a case challenging Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks, a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

The court is expected to rule on the case before its term ends in late June or early July.

The draft opinion in effect states there is no constitutional right to abortion services and would allow individual states to more heavily regulate or outright ban the procedure.

“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” it states, referencing the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey that affirmed Roe’s finding of a constitutional right to abortion services but allowed states to place some constraints on the practice. “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”

A Supreme Court spokeswoman said the court had no comment and The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft Politico posted, which dates from February.

Politico said only that it received “a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court’s proceedings in the Mississippi case along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document.”

The draft opinion strongly suggests that when the justices met in private shortly after arguments in the case on Dec. 1, at least five voted to overrule Roe and Casey, and Alito was assigned the task of writing the court’s majority opinion.

Votes and opinions in a case aren’t final until a decision is announced or, in a change wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, posted on the court’s website.

The report comes amid a legislative push to restrict abortion in several Republican-led states — Oklahoma being the most recent — even before the court issues its decision. Critics of those measures have said low-income women will disproportionately bear the burden of the new restrictions.

The leak jumpstarted the intense political reverberations that the high court’s ultimate decision was expected to have in the midterm election year. Already, politicians on both sides of the aisle were seizing on the report to fundraise and energize their supporters on either side of the hot-button issue.

An AP-NORC poll in December found that Democrats increasingly see protecting abortion rights as a high priority for the government.

Other polling shows relatively few Americans want to see Roe overturned. In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 69% of voters in the presidential election said the Supreme Court should leave the Roe v. Wade decision as is; just 29% said the court should overturn the decision. In general, AP-NORC polling finds a majority of the public favors abortion being legal in most or all cases.

Still, when asked about abortion policy generally, Americans have nuanced attitudes on the issue, and many don’t think that abortion should be possible after the first trimester or that women should be able to obtain a legal abortion for any reason.

Alito, in the draft, said the court can’t predict how the public might react and shouldn’t try. “We cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public’s reaction to our work,” Alito wrote in the draft opinion, according to Politico.

People on both sides of the issue quickly gathered outside the Supreme Court waving signs and chanting on a balmy spring night, following the release of the Politico report.

Reaction was swift from elected officials in Congress and across the country.

In a joint statement from Congress’ top two Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “If the report is accurate, the Supreme Court is poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years — not just on women but on all Americans.”

Maine Governor Janet Mills stated, “as long as I am Governor, I will fight with everything I have to protect reproductive rights and to preserve access to reproductive health care in the face of every and any threat to it – whether from politicians in Augusta or Supreme Court Justices in Washington.”

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, also a Democrat, said people seeking abortions could head to New York. “For anyone who needs access to care, our state will welcome you with open arms. Abortion will always be safe & accessible in New York,” Hochul said in a tweet.

Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch said in a statement, “We will let the Supreme Court speak for itself and wait for the Court’s official opinion.” But local officials were praising the draft.

“This puts the decision making back into the hands of the states, which is where it should have always been,” said Mississippi state Rep. Becky Currie.

Congress could act, too, though a bill that would write Roe’s protections into federal law stalled in the Senate after passing the House last year with only Democratic votes.

At Supreme Court arguments in December, all six conservative justices signaled that they would uphold the Mississippi law, and five asked questions that suggested that overruling Roe and Casey was a possibility.

Only Chief Justice John Roberts seemed prepared to take the smaller step of upholding the 15-week ban, though that too would be a significant weakening of abortion rights.

Until now, the court has allowed states to regulate but not ban abortion before the point of viability, around 24 weeks.

The court’s three liberal justices seemed likely to be in dissent.

It’s impossible to know what efforts are taking place behind the scenes to influence any justice’s vote. If Roberts is inclined to allow Roe to survive, he need only pick off one other conservative vote to deprive the court of a majority to overrule the abortion landmark.

Twenty-six states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to the pro-abortion rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Of those, 22 states already have total or near-total bans on the books that are currently blocked by Roe, aside from Texas. The state’s law banning it after six weeks has already been allowed to go into effect by the Supreme Court due to its unusual civil enforcement structure. Four more states are considered likely to quickly pass bans if Roe is overturned.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, have protected access to abortion in state law.

This year, anticipating a decision overturning or gutting Roe, eight conservative states have already moved to restrict abortion rights. Oklahoma, for example, passed several bills in recent weeks, including one that goes into effect this summer making it a felony to perform an abortion. Like many anti-abortion bills passed in GOP-led states this year, it does not have exceptions for rape or incest, only to save the life of the mother.

Eight Democratic-leaning states protected or expanded access to the procedure, including California, which has passed legislation making the procedure less expensive and is considering other bills to make itself an “abortion sanctuary” if Roe is overturned.

The draft looked legitimate to some followers of the court. Veteran Supreme Court lawyer Neal Katyal, who worked as a clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer and therefore has been in a position to see drafts, wrote on Twitter: “There are lots of signals the opinion is legit. The length and depth of analysis, would be very hard to fake. It says it is written by Alito and definitely sounds like him.”

A new law in Alabama bans gender-affirming medical treatments for anyone under 19. It's set to take effect on Sunday. Today, a federal judge is considering whether it can move forward. Families of transgender youth argue that allowing enforcement would cause irreparable harm. Attorneys for Alabama say the law will protect children from risky interventions that they may later regret.

NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering a two-day hearing in Montgomery. Hi, Debbie.

DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: You told us yesterday about the arguments that lawyers made on behalf of the parents of trans young people. Today, lawyers for the state of Alabama presented their witnesses. How are they defending this transgender medical treatment ban?

ELLIOTT: You know, the general theme has been to portray these gender-affirming medicines - we're talking about puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone therapy, for instance - as risky, as unproven, and as experimental interventions. A 23-year-old woman testified that she regretted trying to transition from female to male using testosterone therapy when she was 19 and in the state of Georgia. She said she was under a mental delusion at the time.

Then, there was testimony from Toronto clinical psychologist James Cantor, who said that a majority of youth who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria later desist, meaning that they change their minds and identify with the sex that they were assigned at birth. He testified that there's no medical consensus in the U.S. Now, he says this despite the fact that most major medical associations consider gender-affirming treatments an accepted standard of care for transgender adolescents.

Under cross-examination, he did acknowledge that he treats adults and has no knowledge of how transgender youth are diagnosed and treated in Alabama. He was also forced to agree that some studies have shown that gender-affirming medical care improves mental health outcomes for some transgender youth.

SHAPIRO: So if this law is allowed to take effect on Sunday, what would it do?

ELLIOTT: Well, it would become a felony, punishable by 10 years in prison, for parents and youth to seek or for doctors to provide gender-affirming medical treatments or surgeries for anyone under 19 years old. The families who have sued say this is an unconstitutional infringement on parental autonomy and discriminates against these youth. The U.S. Justice Department agrees and has intervened in this case.

Plaintiffs presented testimony Thursday from medical professionals who say banning the treatments would have a devastating impact and could raise the risk of suicide and other emotional problems for these teenagers. Doctors also testified that the law puts them in this position where they're forced to choose between obeying the law or abandoning their oath to do no harm and face conviction.

SHAPIRO: There's a tight timeline here. So how does the case resolve?

ELLIOTT: Well, now it's up to U.S. District Judge Liles Burke to decide whether or not to block enforcement of the law while the plaintiffs pursue these constitutional questions. We should note that a federal judge in Arkansas blocked a similar law in that state, and based on questions in the Alabama courtroom, Judge Burke is very aware of that ruling.

During closing arguments this evening, plaintiffs' attorney Jeffrey Doss told the judge that Alabama's law criminalizes parents' concern and love for a child and violates fundamental parental freedom. Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour, on the other side, argued that the state has a wide discretion to regulate areas of medical uncertainty. So we're just waiting on Judge Burke to decide, and Sunday is that deadline.

SHAPIRO: NPR's Debbie Elliott. Thank you.

ELLIOTT: You're welcome, Ari. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",Q2
https://chapelboro.com/news/state-government/nc-attorney-general-josh-stein-recovering-from-stroke,NC Attorney General Josh Stein Recovering from Stroke,"Written by THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said Tuesday he is recovering from a “minor stroke” that prompted doctors to remove a small blood clot.

Stein, a Democrat currently in his second four-year term as the state’s top law enforcement official, said in a tweet that he had stroke-like symptoms Monday night after he and his wife, Anna, walked the family dog.

Stein, 55, said he was taken to a hospital, where the clot-removal procedure was successful. Stein’s office also confirmed his medical emergency and his stay in a Raleigh hospital.

“I’m feeling back to normal now and am beyond blessed to have no lingering effects,” Stein wrote, adding that his physician wants him to stay in the hospital another day or two, then get some rest before returning to work.

“Anna is my hero for recognizing that something was wrong and insisting that I go to the hospital,” Stein said, while also praising the emergency medical technicians who took him for medical help. The couple has three children.

“I have a tremendous amount to be thankful for this morning, especially my loving family,” he added. Politicians from both sides of the aisle offered Stein their best wishes on social media.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper tweeted that he spoke to Stein on Tuesday morning and “he’s doing well. Already back at it on the phone and corresponding. Can’t keep a good man down.”

Stein, a former state senator, has been considered a potential 2024 gubernatorial candidate to succeed Cooper, who is barred by term limits from running again. By narrow margins, Stein was elected attorney general in 2016 and reelected in 2020.

Stein led the consumer protection division in the Department of Justice when Cooper was attorney general before Stein went into private practice.

Stein announced May 17 that he had tested positive for COVID-19 the day before but said he had no symptoms.

While attorney general, Stein has been known for his involvement in a national opioid settlement and for a landmark legal settlement that forced electronic cigarette giant Juul Labs Inc. to pay $40 million to North Carolina and take more action to prevent underage use and sales.

Stein, the son of civil rights attorney Adam Stein, grew up in Chapel Hill. He went to Dartmouth College and later Harvard University, where he received a law degree. He was campaign manager for John Edwards in his successful U.S. Senate bid in 1998.

What will change and what's next,"Gov. John Carney signed eight criminal and racial justice-related bills into law on Monday, ending a more than a year of wrangling over how to enact reforms.

Officials who are responsible for the law changes, including Carney and members of the Legislative Black Caucus, hailed them as meaningful changes to the state's criminal justice system to protect people of color from unfair treatment by authorities.

Some of the law changes were part of an eight-item agenda that Democrats unveiled in June 2020 after a wave of peaceful protests in Wilmington and Dover turned violent in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.

""This has been an incredibly productive session for the General Assembly on making meaningful change to criminal justice reforms,"" Carney said in a statement.

But Democrats have yet to fulfill what is likely their constituents' most desired criminal justice-related wish to change the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights so that police are more susceptible to public scrutiny.

The Officers' Bill of Rights is a section of state law that lets police decide how to discipline bad-acting officers and limits how much the public can know about any punishment.

Progressive Democrats pushed a bill over the summer to allow more public access to the disciplinary process, but it didn't go far due to pushback from police.

That bill is doubly controversial because it would also let state and local governments create civilian review boards, made up of non-officers, to hear and have a say in police discipline.

Supporters of the bill plan to push it again next year when lawmakers are back in session.

POLICE BILL OF RIGHTS STILL UNTOUCHED:Democrats won't reform Delaware police Bill of Rights this year. What will change instead.

Here are the bills Carney signed on Monday

House Bill 115 by Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha, a Democrat from Wilmington, prohibits prosecution of children under 12, except for the most serious charges. It also prohibits transferring juveniles under 16 to Superior Court.

House Bill 215 by Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, a Democrat from New Castle, requires police to record interrogations of suspects in custody. The recordings would not be accessible to the public.

House Bill 162 by Minor-Brown creates a competitive grant fund to help reduce juvenile recidivism, which includes $500,000 off the bat for cognitive behavioral therapy and vocational training.

House Bill 243 by Rep. Franklin Cooke, a Democrat from New Castle, bars police from releasing juvenile mug shots for minor crimes. It would apply to mug shots of children 17 years old or younger, and mug shots could still be published if the juvenile is charged with a violent felony and the mug shot is necessary to protect the public’s safety.

Senate Bill 148 by Sen. Marie Pinkney, a Democrat from New Castle, lets the state-run Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust review police use-of-force cases that result in serious physical injury. Before, the division could only review deadly force cases. The division can also now report the race of people involved in use-of-force cases and whether it played a role.

Senate Bill 111 by Sen. Darius Brown, a Democrat from Wilmington, automates Delaware's expungement process so that people don't have to file a petition with the state. More than 290,000 adults are expected to benefit immediately from the automation, according to a press release about the bill.

Senate Bill 112 by Brown expands eligibility for mandatory expungement to include possession of marijuana or drug paraphernalia, underage possession, consumption of alcohol, and cases involving multiple violation convictions regardless of a person’s prior or subsequent criminal record.

Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 38 by Brown makes technical revisions to the 2019 Adult Expungement Reform Act.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10837515/CDC-calls-older-adults-second-booster-dose-despite-push-experts.html,CDC calls for older adults to get second booster dose despite push-back from many experts,"Advertisement

Health chiefs are urging all Americans over 50 years old to come forward for their fourth Covid vaccine amid rising cases and hospitalizations, despite some experts warning the shots are not yet needed for the group.

Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC,) called on older Americans to 'stay up to date' with their jabs, saying many were last vaccinated 'months ago' on Thursday.

Second boosters were approved for older adults at the end of March but, to date, only a quarter have received the additional shot. The CDC is now doubling down on efforts to get more people jabbed for a fourth time.

They are concerned about waning levels of immunity in the population, with tests showing Covid-fighting antibody levels decline after vaccination. However, they have not concerned other facets of immunity — including B and T-cells — which normally last for much longer.

When the jabs were first approved Dr Mark Marty, a medical expert at John Hopkins University, warned agencies had 'simply ignored' its own experts that disagreed with the decision.

Dr Anna Durbin, a public health expert at the university in Baltimore, Maryland, also weighed in previously saying there are 'very few, if any' people who would benefit from a fourth dose.

It comes as America's Covid deaths fell week-on-week for the ninth day in a row, down 13 percent to 336 fatalities a day on average. This is on a par with last summer.

Infections across the country are still surging with about 102,000 recorded every day on average — up 45 percent on the same time last week.

Dr Rochelle Walensky, who heads up the CDC, told Americans over 50 years old to get their second booster vaccines. But many experts including Dr Marty Makary, from John Hopkins University, have raised concerns over the extra jabs

Covid deaths in the U.S. are down for the ninth day in a row, falling 13 percent to 336 a day on average

But Covid cases continue to rise with about 102,000 now being recorded every day. Infections are doubling every two weeks in 10 states at present

'With cases increasing, it is important that all people have the protection they need, which is why, today, CDC has also strengthened another booster recommendation,' Walensky said.

'Those 50 and older and those who are 12 and older and immunocompromised should get a second booster dose.'

A CDC spokesman added: 'Over the past month we have seen steady increases in cases, with a steep and substantial increase in hospitalizations for older Americans.

CDC says children aged 5 to 11 SHOULD get Pfizer's Covid booster vaccine The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that children ages five to 11 get a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, despite a top expert having warned there is 'no evidence' that they need one. 'Today, I endorsed ACIP's vote to expand eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine booster doses,' CDC Director Rochelle Walensky announced Thursday. 'Children ages 5-11 should receive a booster dose at least 5 months after their primary series.' The booster shot endorsement comes as Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, told DailyMail.com there were no studies showing the extra jab lowered children's risk of symptomatic infection. Youngster's are already at very low risk of severe disease and death, multiple data sources and studies find. She added that it was 'not clear' whether any benefit from the jab outweighed the risks for the age group, given the rare side-effect myocarditis — or heart inflammation — which is more likely among young boys.

'While older Americans have the highest coverage of any age group of first booster doses, most older Americans received their last dose (either their primary series or their first booster dose) many months ago, leaving many who are vulnerable without the protection they may need to prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.'

The statement was made after a panel of experts at the agency agreed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that booster doses should be made available to five to 11-year-olds.

They warned that children in the age group who had not received their first two doses were 'vulnerable' to the virus. They added there were no safety concerns over the vaccine.

Several experts have raised concerns over vaccinating children pointing out they are at very low risk of serious illness and death if they catch the disease. A total of 1,045 youngsters have died from Covid over the last two-and-a-half years, or 0.1 percent of America's more than a million deaths. Three quarters are also estimated to have already been infected with the virus, per a CDC study.

Railing against the decision to approve Covid booster jabs last month, Makary wrote in the Wall Street Journal: 'Some of the FDA's own experts disagree with the decision, but the agency simply ignored them.'

Durbin also voiced concern over the top-up shots, telling ABC in March: 'There are very few, if any, people who, in my opinion require a fourth dose.'

Controversy over whether to recommend the top-up shots for older adults stems from a lack of evidence that immunity from B and T-cells — long overlooked by scientists — has waned.

There are also concerns over vaccine fatigue, with it being likely that getting people to top up immunity again now will leave them less likely to also get the booster shots in the autumn period.

Among younger adults issues have been raised over the very rare side-effect of myocarditis — or inflammation of the heart — which some experts say outweighs any benefit from the vaccine.

Member's of the FDA's own vaccination committee also voiced concern over second boosters, with Eric Rubin the editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine saying at the time that he was yet to see evidence that healthy older adults needed a fourth dose.

Dr Paul Offit, and FDA advisor who is also at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said he was advising his 20-something son to forgo a third shot — despite it being recommended for everyone over 12 years old.

It comes as the U.S. Covid wave continues to grow nationally with infections doubling every two weeks across 10 states. These are: Mississippi, Connecticut, Louisiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, West Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Maryland.

Only one state — Maine — is currently seeing its Covid cases ticking down.

In response to the wave the Federal Government has allowed all adults to order another eight Covid swabs to help keep track of the virus.

New York City health chiefs have also recommended people start wearing face masks indoors, although Mayor Eric Adams has refused to mandate the face coverings, pointing out that hospitals are not under severe pressure.

America registered another 336 Covid fatalities yesterday, which is similar to late last summer when just under 300 were being registered every day on average.

Covid hospitalizations are rising with about 3,200 now being recorded every day, up a quarter on the same time last week.

But many of these patients are likely people admitted for a separate condition — such as a fall — who then test positive. New York City data shows more than half of their 'Covid' patients were not primarily admitted with the disease.",Q2

A Pride Media editor and his husband were called “pedophiles” by a man who saw them on an Amtrak train with their children.

Neal Broverman, editorial director for print media at Pride, The Advocate’s parent company, and his husband, Robbie Pierce, were traveling from Los Angeles to Oakland, Calif., Tuesday on Amtrak’s Coast Starlight. They were accompanied by their 6-year-old son and 5-year-old foster child. They were enjoying the ride and looking out the windows, and then a fellow passenger approached them while the train was stopped at San Jose.

“All of a sudden, there was a man standing there next to me,” Pierce says. The man said to their son, “Remember what I told you earlier. They stole you and they’re pedophiles,” Pierce recounts. The man was very aggressive and said gay people were an abomination.

“I stood up and just was saying, ‘Get away,’” Pierce says. But the man kept yelling at them, saying they weren’t a family, that gays steal Black and Asian children and rape them. Broverman is white and Pierce Latinx, while their son is Black and foster child is Latinx. It turned out the man had been sitting a few rows behind them and had confronted their son previously when the boy had gone to the restroom on his own.

An Amtrak employee eventually ordered the harasser to leave the train, but he refused. Amtrak workers then called local police, who arrived after about 45 minutes and escorted the man off. The conductor asked Broverman and Pierce to fill out a police report, which they did, and they are waiting to hear what action will be taken.

Amtrak was not immediately available for comment for this story.

Pierce says that a few times before, passersby have questioned why they have their children, but this was the first time he and Broverman were called pedophiles. “It’s a new level of homophobia out there,” he says.

“We’ve seen the white Karen who’s like, ‘Why did you kidnap this child?’” Pierce says. Then they’ve been confronted by some Black people who are upset that non-Black parents have been able to adopt a Black child. The man on the train was Black. Pierce says he knows the child placement system is racist, but “we can’t fix that,” he says.

Pierce says LGBTQ+ parents need to be aware that things like this are going to happen and prepare their children for them. And everyone, targets of this rhetoric and allies alike, need to denounce it and make clear it has to stop.

Earlier this month, Philadelphia suffered yet another horrific mass shooting. Rather than the uniquely American ritual of a single madman slaughtering people in a nightclub, school, or music festival, this was instead an ordinary fistfight that got out of control, sparking a disorganized melee. Three people died and 11 others were wounded, the worst mass shooting in the city in seven years.

Subsequent revelations have shed new light on the situation that is highly relevant to the broader debate about gun control and police reform. It turns out that not only have Pennsylvania police departments (in Philadelphia and at the state level) made it much easier to obtain a concealed-carry license in the city, but their own incompetence allowed the man who shot first to get one when he should have been rejected. Both American problems of too many guns and the wretched incompetence of our police departments contributed to the tragedy.

First, what happened? As The Philadelphia Inquirer reports, it all started on South Street, one of the most popular nightlife hubs in the city, at about 11:30 p.m. on June 4. Three men—Gregory Jackson (34), Rashawn Vareen (34), and Micah Towns (23)—apparently got into a verbal altercation, which turned into a fight when Vareen attacked Towns. According to security camera footage, Jackson shot first, hitting Towns, who pulled out a gun of his own and returned fire multiple times, hitting Jackson and killing him.

A short time later, another man named Quran Garner (who was 18, and apparently a friend of Towns) allegedly pulled out his gun and fired down South Street into a crowd. Police coming on the scene then shot Garner in the hand, who dropped the weapon.

All this gunfire—which took maybe a minute—sparked mass panic among hundreds of bystanders, and apparently more wild shooting from two more young men who were uninvolved with the original dispute. Qaadir Dukes-Hill and Nahjee Whittington (both 18), standing apart from one another a block away, allegedly took out their guns and started shooting toward the scene of the first fight, wounding several bystanders in the process, two fatally. Dukes-Hill allegedly shot and killed Alexis Quinn, a home health aide, while Whittington allegedly shot and killed Kristopher Minners, a Girard College student.

It was yet another senseless gun violence tragedy on American streets.

But here’s where the policy comes in. As Victor Fiorillo writes at Philadelphia magazine, in 2021 the Philadelphia Police Department made it dramatically easier to get a concealed-carry permit. Previously, one had to go to a particular city building and get fingerprinted, but now the process is entirely online. As a result, the rate of permit denials declined from 17.5 percent to less than 10 percent, while the number of granted permits exploded from 7,444 in 2020 to 52,230 in 2021. That’s over 3 percent of the entire city population in just one year. Fear of crime accounts for some of the increase, but probably not much—in the Philly suburbs, where the concealed-carry application has always been online, the increase from 2020 to 2021 was just 45 percent.

In Philadelphia today, most people can get a legal handgun and a legal permit to carry it concealed everywhere they go in a matter of minutes.

Handgun sales and transfers in Philly have also increased, from an average of about 11,100 before the pandemic to about 24,000 in both 2020 and 2021. One result of these two trends is a large increase in gun thefts, particularly from cars, which were up 37 percent in 2021. The city is simply awash in guns, both legal and illegal. Garner, one of the shooters, had a “ghost gun” made with a 3D printer, but he did not kill anyone.

Sure enough, both Jackson and Towns had concealed-carry permits. However, as NBC10 recently reported, Jackson should not have been eligible for one, thanks to an arrest for illegal handgun possession in the Philly suburbs in December 2020. Inexplicably, the state police trooper did not file the arrest record until April 28 this year, and Jackson did not receive a court summons until June 1.

Once again, the behavior of the police directly undermined the safety of the people they are supposed to protect. Philadelphia cops senselessly chose to streamline the process to get a concealed-carry permit, flooding city streets with literally tens of thousands of legal handguns. Then, on an occasion when enforcing the scant rules for who is allowed to have a permit might have made a difference, state police sat on the relevant paperwork for 18 months.

More broadly, we see the abject falsehood of the conservative slogan that an “armed society is a polite society.” Many Philadelphians report carrying a concealed weapon for self-defense because of the substantial increase in the homicide rate in recent years, and on an individual level, that might even make sense. But in terms of the city as a whole, the causality plainly runs in the opposite direction: Philadelphia is a (relatively) dangerous place because so many people are armed.

For all of human history, there have been hotheaded people, typically though not always younger men, who get into fights. This disastrous episode illustrates how a nation swimming up to its armpits in guns exponentially worsens the side effects of that universal tendency, both for the men who fight one another and for anyone around them.

If there had been no guns involved, a fight like this almost certainly would have been just a minor assault, with a few scrapes, bruises, and maybe some stitches or a broken bone, something barely worth even filing a police report over. Instead, it escalated in seconds to lethal consequences for one of the fighters, a life-threatening wound for another, plus death for two more totally innocent people, serious injuries for numerous others, and no doubt many years in prison for three teenagers, who seem to be more panicked and dumb than cold-blooded killers.

Even setting a zero-gun counterfactual aside, just one less gun could easily have forestalled the entire incident. If Jackson had been properly denied his conceal-carry permit, there’s a good chance he wouldn’t have been carrying that night and wouldn’t have fired the first shot, and possibly not touched off the entire bloody catastrophe.

In Philadelphia today, most people can get a legal handgun and a legal permit to carry it concealed everywhere they go in a matter of minutes. The few who are legally ineligible can buy a gun illegally, or steal one, mainly thanks to diversions from the gigantic legal supply. As a result, thousands and thousands of people out on the streets every night are packing heat, and as we see, some of them are either spoiling for a fight, or jumpy teenagers with poor impulse control.

Any pleasant night out on the town—Minners, for instance, was a popular mentor out celebrating his birthday, where he hoped to meet some women—can end with you being shot to death by accident. Even Towns, who by all accounts genuinely did only use his weapon in self-defense, helped touch off the rest of the pointless slaughter with the fear spread by his shots.

In other words, Philadelphia has become something like a conservative gun utopia, where the problem of a “bad guy with a gun” has prompted a large fraction of the whole population to arm themselves. This is no way for human beings to live.",Q2
https://www.kcur.org/news/2022-06-09/kansas-city-council-designates-june-7-to-honor-wrongfully-incarcerated-kevin-strickland,Kansas City Council designates June 7 to honor wrongfully incarcerated Kevin Strickland,"Kevin Strickland spent most of his birthdays in prison for murders he did not commit. On Thursday, Mayor Quinton Lucas proclaimed his birthday, June 7, as Kevin Strickland Day in Kansas City.

Lucas presented the resolution to the City Council, saying how touched they all were by Strickland’s story.

“I am not somebody who runs the state of Missouri, none of us in here do, but I want to make sure that you know, from our heartfelt appreciations, we say thank you for your fight. We apologize for everything that you went through in the name of our city, our county, and our state,"" Lucas said.

“We hope just a few acknowledgements, like this one and so many others, let you know how much we care about you, how much forgiveness we have in our hearts, and more than anything, how much we thank you for the impact you're having on so many more now.”

Strickland was charged with capital murder in 1978 for the killing of Sherrie Black, John Walker and Larry Ingram in Kansas City. He was 18 when he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 50 years by an all-white jury. Strickland’s incarceration was the longest wrongful imprisonment in Missouri history and one of the longest in the country .

The 1978 conviction rested on the testimony of Cynthia Douglas, who was shot in the leg. Douglas identified two of the suspects, Vincent Bell and Kilm Adkins, who later pleaded guilty. She later testified against Strickland.

Carlos Moreno / KCUR 89.3 Kevin Strickland talks Thursday afternoon outside Kansas City city council chambers following Mayor Quinton Lucas proclaiming June 7, Strickland's birthday, as Kevin Strickland Day in Kansas City.

Douglas recanted her testimony against Strickland in 2009 and maintained she was pressured into naming Strickland, whom she knew, as one of the assailants. Adkins and Bell also asserted his innocence, naming someone else as their accomplice.

Using a state public safety bill signed into law in 2021 that allows prosecuting attorneys to file innocence motions, Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney Jean Peters Baker moved for Strickland’s release. Gov. Mike Parson and Attorney General Eric Schmitt opposed the move and fought it strenuously in court.

After a three-day hearing, Strickland was exonerated and released from prison on Nov. 23, 2021.

Strickland said he was honored by the city's proclamation but wished it was for something other than his wrongful conviction. He urged people to focus on holding the state accountable for his wrongful incarceration and for those of so many others.

“I'd just rather that if we could consider naming it something like Conscious Awareness Day of All Wrongful Convictions, because before me there were many others,” Strickland said. “Let's do something moving forward to make the state pay and accept the responsibility other than the mayor extending his condolences the way he's doing.”

Strickland was not compensated by Missouri, which only compensates prisoners exonerated through DNA evidence. But he said he was hopeful that days like this were proof things were changing.

“It means that people are now paying attention, that we do have a problem. I mean, 43 [years] is far too long,"" Strickland said. ""It means a lot that they want to honor me and extend their condolences like that, but, you know, nothing can ever settle me.”",Q2
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghislaine-maxwell-30-years-in-prison-federal-prosecutors-argue/,"Ghislaine Maxwell should spend 30 to 55 years in prison, federal prosecutors argue","Ghislaine Maxwell found guilty on five out of six counts, including sex trafficking of a minor

Federal prosecutors have recommended that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell spend at least 30 years in prison for her role in the sexual abuse of teenage girls over a 10-year period by her onetime boyfriend, financier Jeffrey Epstein.

In written arguments on Wednesday, prosecutors said Maxwell should serve between 30 years and 55 years in prison, reflecting federal sentencing guidelines. They made their recommendations to the judge who will preside over a sentencing hearing on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court.

The 60-year-old Maxwell was convicted in December of sex trafficking and other crimes after a monthlong trial that included testimony from four women who said they were abused as teenagers.

Defense lawyers said in a sentencing submission last week that she should spend no more than five years in prison and shouldn't pay for Epstein's crimes, since he was the mastermind and principal abuser and ""orchestrated the crimes for his personal gratification."" Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan federal jail cell in 2019, after having been arrested and charged with sex trafficking in a widely-publicized indictment. His death was ruled a suicide.

Prosecutors said Maxwell played an ""instrumental role in the horrific sexual abuse of multiple young teenage girls"" between 1994 and 2004 at some of Epstein's palatial residences. They called her crimes ""monstrous.""

""As part of a disturbing agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell identified, groomed, and abused multiple victims, while she enjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury and privilege. In her wake, Maxwell left her victims permanently scarred with emotional and psychological injuries,"" prosecutors wrote.

""That damage can never be undone, but it can be accounted for in crafting a just sentence for Maxwell's crimes,"" they said.

Prosecutors also urged the judge to reject Maxwell's pleas for leniency on the grounds that she has suffered in extraordinary ways in jail while awaiting trial and afterward. Defense lawyers said she has faced death threats and harsh conditions that have caused her to lose hair and weight. In April, a judge rejected Maxwell's request for a new trial after her conviction in December of 2021.

Ghislaine Maxwell appears during closing arguments in this courtroom sketch drawn amid her trial. Jane Rosenberg

Maxwell's appearance at trial proved those claims were wrong, prosecutors said, adding: ""The defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair.""

They said Maxwell ""has enjoyed remarkable privileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate. It is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her life as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less the extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.""

Prosecutors also attacked claims by Maxwell's lawyers that she suffered ""a credible death threat"" in jail, saying that an internal probe of the purported threat revealed that an inmate remarked to someone in passing something to the effect of: ""I'd kill her if someone paid me a million dollars."" As a result, they said, someone who overheard the remark reported it and the inmate was moved from the housing unit.

They also cited what they described as Maxwell's ""complete failure to address her offense conduct and her utter lack of remorse. Instead of showing even a hint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate attempt to cast blame wherever else she can.""

Maxwell's efforts to cast aspersions on the motives of the government for prosecuting her and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein's crimes are ""absurd and offensive,"" prosecutors said.

""Maxwell was an adult who made her own choices. She made the choice to sexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years, working as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims,"" they said.

Prosecutors said nearly all of the $22.5 million in assets that Maxwell claimed in a bail proposal that was never granted was given to her by Epstein.

""The defendant's access to wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed shoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from struggling families who became the defendant and Epstein's victims,"" prosecutors said.

The sentencing submission also included quotes from letters written to the judge by women who testified during the trial, including Kate, an ex-model from Great Britain who said ""the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far-reaching for me.""

""I have struggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic attacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered low self esteem, loss of career opportunities. I have battled greatly with feeling unable to trust my own instincts, in choosing romantic relationships,"" she wrote.",Q2

Police arrested Marquis Simon Colvin, 25, and Sydnei Moran Dunn, 24, who are accused of killing their four-week-old infant with alcohol poisoning in Paulding County in the US state of Georgia.

The four-week old infant was brought to the hospital by its parents and was unresponsive.

The youngster's mum Sydnei Moran Dunn stated that she had consumed a large quantity of alcohol the day before and that the child must have gotten alcohol poisoning from her while she was breast-feeding.

However, Dunn then indicated that the child's father put alcohol in the baby's bottle, with doctors saying the child had a quantity of alcohol in its system that was well over four times the legal limit for an adult.

In a statement obtained by Newsflash, the Paulding County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said on 19th April: ""Detectives with the Juvenile Division of the Paulding County Sheriff's Office arrested a Paulding County mother and father on April 14, 2022, for the murder of their four-week old infant.

""Deputies were contacted by authorities at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) on April 13, 2022, at approximately 3:30 PM reference a four-week old infant who was brought to the hospital by its parents and was unresponsive.

""CHOA officials stated that the circumstances surrounding the child's condition did not make sense and sounded as if they needed to be looked into by law enforcement.

""When Detectives arrived at CHOA, they met with medical professionals about the condition of the child.""

The police stated: ""Detectives then began speaking with Sydnei Dunn and Marquis Colvin, who are the parents of the child, about the incident.

""Initially, Dunn stated that she had consumed a large quantity of alcohol the day before and that the child must have gotten alcohol poisoning from her while she was breast-feeding.

""She then indicated that the child's father put alcohol in the baby's bottle. Once the child was unresponsive, she explained that is when they took the baby to the hospital.

""On April 14, 2022, hospital officials indicated that the child had passed away as a result of its condition.""

The police added: ""Doctors further advised that the child had a quantity of alcohol in its system that was well over four times the legal limit for an adult.""

PCSO continued: ""As a result of the search warrant, combined with the interviews of Dunn and Colvin, both individuals were placed under arrest without incident and charged with the below listed offences.

Pleasant Valley graduate Bryan Kohberger was arrested late last year and charged with burglary and four counts of first-degree murder in connection with the Nov. 13, 2022, killings of Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near the University of Idaho campus.

At the time, Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at nearby Washington State University, and the killings left the close-knit communities of Moscow, Idaho, and Pullman, Washington, reeling.

A preliminary hearing - where prosecutors must show a judge that there is enough evidence to justify moving forward with felony charges - had been scheduled to begin June 26.

But on Tuesday, a grand jury indicted Kohberger on the same criminal charges, effectively rerouting the case directly to the state’s felony court level and allowing prosecutors to skip the preliminary hearing process.

Court documents have already detailed much of the investigation that prosecutors say ties Kohberger to the slayings. A white sedan allegedly matching one owned by Kohberger was caught on surveillance footage repeatedly cruising past the rental home on a dead-end street around the time of the killings.

Police say traces of DNA found on a knife sheath inside the home where the students were killed matches that of the 28-year-old Kohberger. Investigators also contend that a cellphone belonging to Kohberger was near the victims’ home on a dozen occasions before the killings, though it was apparently turned off around the time of the early-morning attack.

Kohberger was arrested Dec. 30, 2022, at his parents’ home in eastern Pennsylvania, and law enforcement officials seized dark clothing, medical gloves, a flashlight and other items from the home, according to court documents. In Pullman, investigators seized stained bedding, strands of what appeared to be hair, and a single glove from his WSU campus apartment, according to another search warrant.

Still, the unsealed court documents do not appear to suggest a motive, nor whether the killer had specifically targeted any of the victims. It’s also not clear if prosecutors believe Kohberger had met any of the victims before the night they died.

Kernodle, Chapin, Mogen and Goncalves were friends and members of the university’s Greek system, and the three women lived together in the rental home just across the street from campus. Chapin - Kernodle’s boyfriend - was there visiting on the night of the attack. The killings left many of their classmates and residents of Moscow reeling with grief and fear.

The New York State Legislature approved an additional $22 million investment for sewer hook-ups in neighborhoods off of New York Avenue in Huntington.

The money is in addition to $44 million that Suffolk County and the town of Huntington agreed to spend for the sewer expansion in December. Construction is expected to begin in early 2024.

State Senator Jim Gaughran helped to secure the funds in the next state budget. He said this will help expand housing and protect the environment.

“This is an opportunity for this to not only improve the situation for the homeowners but to protect the environment for everyone, by making sure nitrates will no longer potentially get in our drinking water in the area,” Gaughran said.

Upgraded sewer systems help replace old septic tanks and cesspools that contribute to nitrogen pollution in nearby waterways.

“This will be something that will be a major change for the residents of the district and also will be people who will be able to say that they can get rid of their cesspools and as a result be cleaning up the environment,” Gaughran said.

UVALDE, Texas—The gunman behind the mass shooting at an elementary school here lingered outside the building for 12 minutes firing shots before walking into the school and barricading in a classroom where he killed 19 children and two teachers, authorities said in a news conference Thursday laying out a new timeline of events. Victor Escalon, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said he couldn't say why no one stopped the deceased gunman, 18 year-old [], from entering the school during that time Tuesday. Most of the shots [he] fired came during the first several minutes when he entered the school, Mr. Escalon said. DPS officials previously said an armed school officer confronted [the shooter] as he arrived at the school. Mr. Escalon said Thursday that information was incorrect and no one encountered [him] as he arrived at the school. ""There was not an officer readily available and armed,"" Mr. Escalon said.

JUST WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?

Why does all the information keep changing? Especially this long after the fact?

Why was everyone told that the shooter was pursued by police before crashing his car and barricading himself in the classroom?

Why did the Texas Department of Public Safety say that the shooter was engaged by an armed school safety officer before he went into the classroom?

Said school safety officer never even existed, and that's just now coming out?

This guy let off shots outside an elementary school in Texas for 12 minutes and nobody did anything?

This is just not sitting well with me.

Here is the new timeline of events, from the WSJ:

[He] shot his grandmother Tuesday morning and then used her truck to drive to Robb Elementary School, crashing the truck into a nearby ditch at 11:28 a.m., according to the timeline laid out by Mr. Escalon. The gunman then began shooting at people at a funeral home across the street, prompting a 911 call reporting a gunman at the school at 11:30. [He] then climbed a fence onto school grounds and began firing before walking inside, unimpeded, at 11:40. The first police arrived on the scene at 11:44 and exchanged gunfire with Ramos, who barricaded himself in a fourth-grade classroom. There, he killed the students and teachers. A Border Patrol tactical team went into the school an hour later, around 12:40, was able to get into the classroom and kill [him], Mr. Escalon said.

Meanwhile, did you know responding officers were unable to get into the classroom door and had to go find a staff member with a key to open it? From AP:

Meanwhile, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said the Border Patrol agents had trouble breaching the classroom door and had to get a staff member to open the room with a key. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation.

Does that make any sense to you?

And don't miss this part from the WSJ article:

Thursday's updates came as Uvalde residents were asking questions and expressing anger over the time it took for law enforcement to end the school shooting. Videos circulated on social media showing parents confronting police outside the building while [the shooter] was barricaded in the classroom. ""The police were doing nothing,"" said Angeli Rose Gomez, who after learning about the shooting drove 40 miles to Robb Elementary School, where her children are in second and third grade. ""They were just standing outside the fence. They weren't going in there or running anywhere.""

I'm not trying to be weird or suggest anything crazy. I am not trying to be an agitator or score points.

I am just saying that none of this makes any sense, and given the circumstances that is unacceptable.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1688048/old-guards-return,Old guard’s return,"IN a rebuke to Pindi politics, the old guard regained power, three and a half years after it was banished. But so bad had the imposed challenger been that their return is a relief, both to Pindi and Pakistan. It’s a special triumph for the Sharifs or at least Sharif-lite, as father and son conquer Islamabad and Lahore. The establishment will now hope that the ‘good’ PML-N keeps the ‘bad’ PML-N out of its hair.

The PTI let the country regress, not just economically — where even the PPP and PML-N did only a bit better — but more so in the political, social, external and security realms. In the economy, there is some excuse due to Covid-19; in other realms, not even that.

But can both deliver? I use the analytical lens I used for the PTI during its tenure: good national outcomes come from good regime policies which come from a strong team. Given the poor quality of PTI’s cabinet, I had predicted in 2018, even with the tabdeeli craze at its peak, that it would give poor outcomes. So it did.

In comparing the two cabinets on 16 key posts, I rate Shehbaz Sharif’s more competent on nine (prime minister, finance, foreign, planning, energy, water, information, climate and law), similar on industries, interior, education and human rights and worse on health, commerce and BISP. So we have a more capable leader, but one who has delivered more on provincial projects rather than federal policies. This is still better than one who delivered on neither, and instead, delivered moral sermons.

Yet there are crucial gaps in the economic and social sectors. Economy is our big worry. The team has strengths in finance, planning and energy but not in investment, industries and commerce which play critical roles in increasing jobs and exports. The (dis)appointments here, being political appointees, lack technical expertise and vitality. On the social side, climate change and BISP are strong but health, education and human rights aren’t.

The current set-up may do better than the PTI.

Governance encompasses legislation, policy, institutional reform, projects and service delivery. The PPP is good at legislation, PML-N at projects and PTI perhaps at service delivery (health cards, Covid-19 etc). None does well on policy and institutional reform which in some ways are the most crucial.

The new regime must develop a meaningful policy and reform agenda that integrates economic and social concerns to put us on a sustainable and equitable progress path. The full spectrum of skills needed to do so are not available with the PML-N and PPP and they must look beyond their ranks to infuse new blood. The PTI did well in bringing in a few competent persons but did not retain them. Sharif must do better.

But given the current team, my prediction is that it may do much better than PTI in the external, social, security and political realms. Some early signs back this claim. Externally, ties are being repaired with key capitals. Socially, there is an end to retrogressive sermons from the prime minister and there are plans to revisit the Single National Curriculum.

Where security is concerned, major actions against the TTP were taken under the PPP and PML-N earlier, which gives hope now as TTP regroups.

Politically, the set-up has a genuine mandate and won’t need Pindi crutches, unlike the PTI. Both the PPP and PML-N oversaw major consensus legislation on key national issues (18th Amendment and Fata merger) unlike PTI’s partisan-driven unilateral record (EVMs and overseas voting). Some steps to end the crackdown on the media and civil society have emerged.

There are also signs they may pursue sleaze cases against the PTI. But the tarni­shed PML-N and PPP lack the moral weight to do so. Our system can’t deliver fair acco­u­ntability yet. It wou­ld be best to first deve­lop it. They may also pursue Article 6 char­ges for viola­ting the Consti­tu­tion, but that is an overkill. A case under Article 5(2) for disobeying the Constitution may be more apt. A big political challenge is Balo­ch­is­tan though I see few signs of the government pursuing peace against Pindi’s wishes.

The PML-N and PPP did better fiscally than PTI; the PML-N was worst on current account and all did badly on genuine growth. While things may be a bit better overall, my prediction is that we won’t break our vicious cycle of IMF loans or achieve genuine progress. Mortifyingly, since our vicious circle is the circumference of a deep abyss, the continued dance of death may lead us to fall in.

This return of political legitimacy is our last hope to avoid the abyss. The PPP and PML-N are corrupt and inept. Yet so bad is our state of affairs that even they are better than other immediate options: the PTI, technocracy or martial law. If they fail again, which is quite likely, so may Pakistan.

Exactly one year ago, on June 1, 2021, Santa Clarita emergency responders united closer than they ever had to in the face of tragedy that occurred in their own station– a meeting place where they come together to bond between combatting tragedies, not to experience it firsthand.

“Another tear-filled tribute,” said Brent Carlon, the brother of the fallen firefighter, in response to the Los Angeles County Fire Department’s 2022 Firefighters Memorial Service.

In a ceremony that normally pays tribute to the firefighters who gave it their all while serving with bravery and distinction, Carlon’s brother’s story looks a little different.

Firefighter Specialist Tory Carlon — a 20-year veteran of the Department and admired by many through the dedication of his job — passed away during his morning shift exactly one year ago today, by the hands of a disgruntled coworker.

“As a fire chief, I’ve dealt with a lot of deaths and a lot of fallen members of my department,” said Fire Chief Daryl L. Osby of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. “And I’ve always prayed that we would never have a line-of-duty death— and never thought that if it occurred that it would occur in this fashion.”

How It All Unfolded

Firefighter Tory Carlon, 44, was inside the Agua Dulce firehouse with Fire Captain Arnie Sandoval, 55, on June 1, 2021 when a disgruntled off-duty firefighter returned to the station and opened fire.

Only two other employees were on-shift during the attack, and the two quickly came together, providing medical aid to the two firefighters who were shot.

Around 10:55 a.m. on June 1, neighboring stations received reports of the shooting on the 8700 block of Sierra Highway in Agua Dulce, just north of Santa Clarita, according to Osby.

While their quick response resulted in saving the life of Sandoval, Carlon – who was shot several times in the upper torso – succumbed to his injuries and passed away within minutes.

A manhunt for the shooter quickly ensued, leading emergency responders to the suspect’s home in Acton which had reportedly caught fire during the investigation.

“Following the shooting we learned that the firefighter returned to his house,” Osby said. “He barricaded himself. The home was set on fire. And he was also found deceased.”

In the hours following the shooting at Station 81, aerial footage showed the home burning to the ground with only a few walls still standing, and possibly a body floating in the backyard pool.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Special Enforcement Bureau, known as the SWAT for other law enforcement, were deployed to drop from helicopters and surround the property – which at the time was believed to be rigged with explosives, before discovering the suspect had turned the gun on himself, dying by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

The gunman was identified as 45-year-old fire specialist Jonathan Tatone who had been working as a county firefighter since at least 2012, according to public payroll and pension records kept by Transparent California.

While little information has been released regarding a particular reason for the shooting, preliminary interviews with other firefighters suggested that the shooter and 20-year veteran firefighter who was shot had “some workplace beef,” according to Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Dean in 2021, who is overseeing the homicide investigation.

“It sounds like they didn’t like each other,” Dean told Fox News, without disclosing further details.

Remembering The Fallen

Survived by his wife and three daughters, Carlon and his family were well-known throughout the Santa Clarita Valley, and most notably loved for his dedication to family and community.

“This loss is extremely heartbreaking and tough,” Osby said. “But also, what remains in the hearts of many of us is Tory… He was a loving husband, father, son, brother, uncle… coworker and friend. Tory loved his job; but when I met his family, I knew that that was his second love. His first love was his family… Tory will always be with us. He will greatly be missed, but he will never be forgotten.”

Long-time friend and fire captain Chris Lujano commented on the type of man Carlon was during a memorial service in June of 2021, noting their experiences going through firemen training together to being each other’s best man at each other’s weddings.

“He was a man of principle,” Lujano said. “He wanted to do things the right way.”

Carlon’s oldest daughter Joslyn also delivered a speech, supported by her mother and two sisters.

“My daddy raised his girls well,” she said. “He taught us right from wrong and was such an amazing role model to have as a child. I hope I can carry that on to my younger sister, Brie, and share stories to her about him, because unfortunately, she only got six years with my daddy. And I also hope to carry it on to my own kids one day as well.”

In the days following the initial Station 81 shooting, Joslyn graduated from Saugus High School, and felt the love from first responders around the state.

When her name was called, she had her Father’s firefighting jacket draped over her shoulders and support from hundreds of firefighters from throughout Los Angeles County and the state filling the College of the Canyons stadium, with dozens of fire engines in the parking lot.

Memorialized by his brothers in arms and his family of girls, his older brother also remembers how Carlon ultimately shaped the man he had become, and misses him dearly.

“Little brother, I looked up to you, the career you had,” Brent said. “In closing… something good will come out of this.”

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10928309/Trump-slams-Mike-Pence-human-conveyor-belt-delivering-fraudulent-votes-January-6.html,Trump slams Mike Pence as a 'human conveyor belt' for delivering 'fraudulent' votes on January 6,"Former President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on his former vice president on Friday, dismissing Mike Pence as a 'human conveyor belt' for failing to reject what he said were fraudulent votes in the 2020 election.

It came at the end of a week that revealed more evidence of the way he and his allies tried and failed to persuade Pence to overturn the result.

The House January 6 committee released testimony of a White House official saying that Trump called Pence a 'wimp.'

Trump tore into the hearings as a 'show trial' in his most sustained attack on the committee since it began its investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

'I don't even know who these people are. But I never called Mike Pence a wimp,' he told a gathering of religious conservatives in Nashville, Tennessee.

'I never called him a wimp. Mike Pence had a chance to be great.

'He had a chance to be frankly historic.

'But just like Bill Barr and the rest of these weak people, Mike - and I say it sadly because I liked them - but Mike did not have the courage to act.'

He also claimed that Democrats were in favor of killing babies, boasted that the audience for his January 6 speech was bigger than for Martin Luther King's 'I have a dream' speech, and said the education system was so distorted that teachers could not teach the Bible but were allowed to teach Kindergarten children they could pick their gender.

Former President Donald Trump renewed his attack on his Vice President Mike Pence and the January 6 committee in a speech to religious conservatives on Friday at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's 'Road to the Majority' gathering in Nashville, Tennessee

Pence defended his actions in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Friday. 'Ultimately, I believe that most Americans understand that we did our duty that day under the Constitution and the laws of this country,' he said

He reserved most of his fire for the January 6 investigation and for Pence.

The committee's public hearings revealed how key aides and officials told Trump that he had lost the election and his claims of fraud would not be enough to change the result.

Even so, a small circle of advisers developed a plan that centered on pressuring Pence to use his role as president of the Senate to reject electoral college votes from disputed states.

Pence refused, and as Trump supporters overran the Capitol on January 6 some could be heard chanting: 'Hang Mike Pence.'

In his speech to religious conservatives at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's 'Road to the Majority' gathering, Trump berated his vice president, whose own possible path to the presidency in 2024 will run through the Christian right.

And he repeated his false claims that his defeat to Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud.

'Mike was afraid of whatever he was afraid of,' said Trump.

'But as you heard a year and a half ago, Mike Pence had absolutely no choice but to be a human conveyor belt .... even if the votes were fraudulent.

'They said he had to send the votes ... couldn't do anything.'

Trump this week complained that he wanted equal air time as the January 6 committee hearings. So he made the most of a receptive audience

Pence defended his actions in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Friday.

'Ultimately, I believe that most Americans understand that we did our duty that day under the Constitution and the laws of this country,' he said.

'Mike Pence had absolutely no choice but to be a human conveyor belt .... even if the votes were fraudulent,' said Trump in his speech

Sen. Marsha Blackburn also spoke at the Faith and Freedom Coalition event in Nashville

Trump characterized the violence of that day as nothing but a protest, and even bragged about the size of the crowd that watched him deliver a speech in the morning.

'It was a simple protest,' he said.

'It got out of hand and I will say one thing they don't talk about they never show the size of the crowd.

'I believe it was the largest number of people I've ever spoken to.'

Trump also delivered a broadside in the education wars.

'Our children are captives to unhinged Marxist educators who are pushing inappropriate sexual, racial and political material on our children from the youngest possible age,' he said.

'They're not old enough to think

'The current education system is so upside down that school prayer is banned. But drag shows are absolutely allowed.

'You can't teach the Bible, but you can teach children that men get pregnant and that kindergartners are allowed to pick their own gender.'

The line went down went down well with his religious audience.

The biggest applause line came when he teased a possible 2024 run, something he has floated repeatedly without yet announcing.

'Would anybody like for me to run for president?' he asked, bringing the audience to its feet and setting off thunderous clapping.

He also painted a picture of two Americas. In one, leftist mobs are allowed to threaten conservative Supreme Court justices without condemnation from President Joe Biden; in the other conservatives protesting at the U.S. Capitol are being hounded.

'The sick individual showed up at Justice Kavanaugh's home with a knife, a gun, crowbar, zip ties, and yet, Joe Biden has not condemned it,' he said.

He added that he would consider pardons for people arrested in connection with the January 6 attack.

'To be one people in one nation America must have one set of laws and one system of justice. We don't have that we have two systems. the radical left is not above the law and conservatives are not beneath the law,' he said to cheers.

'The targeting and repression now being directed to Republicans and conservatives is totally unprecedented in American history.'

He also ran through his record in power, highlighting work on the border wall, nominating conservative justices to the Supreme Court and his action against ISIS in the Middle East.

'I called in Congress to ban late term abortions unlike Democrats who allow babies to be executed after birth... executed after birth,' he said.

The baby is born. They decide they don't want the baby after birth. Look at the former governor of Virginia right after birth. Remember that one?

'In the Republican Party we believe that every life is a sacred gift from God.'

Conservatives have tried to claim that former Democratic Governor Ralph Northam was in favor of infanticide because of remarks he made about third-trimester abortions in the case of severe developmental abnormalities.

The speech came at the end of a difficult week for Trump world as the House investigation continues its public hearings.

Multiple Trump allies including his daughter Ivanka, former attorney general William Barr and other officials have testified to the committee that they did not believe Trump's false election claims.

Trump used his speech to hit back at the committee's work. And he went on to compare the size of his crowd on January 6 to the crowd that heard Martin Luther King Jr's famous 'I have a dream' speech.

'They said it was a million people, one million people and then I gave my speech and they showed the same thing,' he claimed.

'It's hard to believe many many decades later, but it's identical architecture identical pools ... everything was identical ...

'His they said one million people now my pictures were exactly the same but the people were slightly closer together.'

He complained that he had more people, but the media said the crowd was only 25,000 strong.",Q2
https://kfiam640.iheart.com/content/2022-06-03-judge-faults-spitzer-in-double-murder-case-killer-gets-life-in-prison/,Judge Faults Spitzer in Double-Murder Case; Killer Gets Life in Prison,"NEWPORT BEACH (CNS) - Just before sentencing a double-murderer to two life-without-parole prison terms, an Orange County Superior Court judge ruled Friday that District Attorney Todd Spitzer violated the recently enacted Racial Justice Act in the case by making racially charged comments while discussing the prosecution.

Judge Gregg Prickett agreed with defense attorneys for Jamon Rayon Buggs, 47, that Spitzer violated the Racial Justice Act during discussions with prosecutors about whether to seek the death penalty in the case, in which Buggs was convicted of killing two people in Newport Beach in 2019.

But Prickett said Spitzer arrived at the proper ""remedy"" for the violation by not seeking a death sentence and opting to pursue the minimum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Prickett found that Spitzer's statements suggesting Black men date white women to elevate their status in society were a violation of the newly enacted law.

Defense attorney Denise Gragg argued for a new trial for Buggs, but Prickett denied the request. Gragg characterized as ""nuts"" Spitzer's argument that his comments were addressing cross-racial identification issues in the case. George Turner of the District Attorney's Office, however, noted that the issue of mistaken identity due to racial bias ended up being a part of the defense's case in the trial.

In a statement, Spitzer said, ""The judge ruled that the defendant was treated fairly at every stage of the proceeding, from charging to conviction to the sentence of life without the possibility of parole for executing two innocent people in cold blood.""

Buggs was convicted May 3 of two counts of murder, with a special circumstance allegation of multiple murders, and single felony counts each of attempted burglary and possession of a firearm by a felon. Jurors also found true sentencing enhancements for the discharge of a firearm causing death.

Buggs was convicted of killing 48-year-old Wendi Sue Miller of Costa Mesa and 38-year-old Darren Donald Partch of Newport Beach in 2019. The two were found dead in Partch's residence at Villa Siena, 2101 E. 15th St.

Meanwhile, Buggs himself asked Prickett on Friday to delay his sentencing so he could fire his lawyers and represent himself. Buggs, as he has in the past, espoused debunked ""sovereign citizen"" conspiracy theory arguments that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the court.

Buggs said he wanted to reset the clock legally so he could go back to the arraignment stage of the case, then refuse to enter a plea so he wouldn't ""enter into a contract"" with the state, acknowledging jurisdiction in the criminal case.

Prickett, however, was having none of it.

""You have this misguided belief somehow that we need your permission to be involved in these proceedings,"" Prickett told Buggs. ""We have jurisdiction over you. The offenses were committed in this county. ... This is not a civil situation. This is a criminal situation.""

Buggs responded, ""Then I'm a slave. I don't have a choice. That's what you're telling me. I'm a criminal before I'm a citizen.""

Prickett sentenced Buggs to two life-without-parole prison terms, along with another 54 years to life.

During the sentencing hearing, Buggs said he was sorry for what he did.

""I want to say this was completely my fault,"" Buggs said.

He said he was ""emotional"" at the time as he was going through on- again, off-again relationship with his ex-girlfriend.

""I give my condolences,"" he said of the victims. ""I'm sorry this happened. I apologize. I stand accountable for what I did. ... I ask you for your forgiveness. ... I opened up my heart to my ex-girlfriend and it ended up on bad terms.""

He said he was trying to ""get away from her"" at the time and said the victims were ""in the wrong place at the wrong time. ... I'm human and just like anyone else I make mistakes. We all make mistakes. And this mistake cost me my life.""

Prickett didn't buy Buggs' suggestion that he killed Miller by mistake, confusing her with his ex-girlfriend.

""In all likelihood she was crying out and the defendant was close enough to hear her and see her and know it wasn't his ex-girlfriend,"" Prickett said. ""They were killed for no apparent reason.""

Miller's daughter, Cambria Carpenter, told the judge that 1,000 people attended her mom's funeral. She said her mother was ""determined"" and ""sweet"" and ""truly brought out the best in everyone.""

""Because of (Buggs) my mother didn't get to see me graduate from high school,"" she said, calling the defendant a monster.

In his opening statement at trial, Senior Deputy District Attorney Dave Porter said Buggs went to Partch's residence with a .38-caliber revolver and heard him ""with someone he thought was his ex-girlfriend. He could not be more wrong.""

Buggs went inside the residence and startled the couple, who were naked in bed. Porter said Partch jumped up out of bed and Miller rolled over the other side.

The prosecutor said Buggs shot Partch first. Miller ""had nowhere to run, no place to hide, no way to defend herself"" as Buggs ""placed the gun on the right side of her head and pulled the trigger,"" he said.

The nude victims ""died in a pool of blood,"" he said.

Buggs sought out Partch because he mistakenly thought he was dating the defendant's ex-girlfriend, Samantha Brewers, Porter said. However, Partch only met Brewers once at a 24 Hour Fitness gym in Costa Mesa and the two exchanged some messages on Instagram.

Brewers had moved to California from Minnesota and was living in Murrieta when she met Buggs at a fitness center, hired him as a trainer and the relationship evolved into a romance, Porter said. And when Buggs got a better job in Huntington Beach, the two moved there.

But when he later quit his job, it ""put a strain on the relationship"" and Brewers moved out, but the two stayed in touch, he said. By Thanksgiving 2018, Brewers told him the relationship was over, but he would not accept that, the prosecutor said.

When Buggs saw Brewers and Partch connect on Instagram, ""He wanted to know who Darren Partch was,"" Porter said. Buggs used premium web services to track down addresses and telephone numbers for Partch, and called and ""threatened"" him.

Partch was ""totally shocked,"" Porter said. ""But he said, `No problem, I'll stay away from her.""'

Partch called Brewers and told her he didn't want any part of ""drama.""

""And that was it,"" Porter said. ""But in the defendant's mind, they were still a couple.""

Brewers was dating a chiropractor, Jared Young, so Buggs also confronted him, Porter said. She also called police one night in the weeks leading up to the murder when she saw that Buggs was following her home from a gym.

Investigators found numerous online searches Buggs had done for Brewers, Young and Partch, he said.

Partch first met Miller at the Sandpiper Bar in Laguna Beach April 19, 2019, and left the club about 1 a.m. April 20, to return to Partch's home, Porter said. One of her friends said to text her when she arrived at Partch's residence, which she did. It was the last message she sent anyone.

Later on April 20, after the couple was killed, an Irvine resident reported an attempted burglary at a two-story townhouse at 818 Silk Tree in Irvine about 4:30 p.m. Buggs climbed up the second-story balcony looking for Jared Young, but unbeknownst to him, he was on the property of someone else with the same name, Porter said.

The resident made eye contact with the defendant after she investigated the source of a loud thump on the balcony, Porter said. She dashed over to the screen door, locked it and screamed.

Buggs scrambled down as she called police and fired his gun, Porter said. Buggs later told police it was an accidental firing of the gun.

Police set up surveillance in the neighborhood and later caught sight of him, but when an officer attempted a traffic stop, Buggs took off and led police on a high-speed pursuit that ended in a cul de sac, where he bailed out and was eventually found hiding behind a tree, Porter said.

Police found his bag filled with a gun and a notebook with Partch's phone numbers and address, Porter said. The gun matched ballistics tests for the double-murder weapon.

Sarah Hefling of the Associate Defender's Office asked jurors to focus on Buggs' ""mental state"" on the night of the killings.

""This is something other than first-degree murder,"" she said.

Defense attorneys argued for voluntary manslaughter and acknowledged that second-degree murder would also be more appropriate than first-degree murder. They also argued it was a case of mistaken identity, as Miller was said to resemble Brewers.

""Mental state is an issue in this case,"" she said. ""Jamon Buggs did not act in a premeditated and deliberate manner.""

Buggs met Brewers in March 2017 and the two quickly fell in love, with Brewers becoming close to Buggs' family, Hefling said.

""This was not a casual dating relationship,"" she said. ""They saw themselves as a power couple.""

The two moved to Huntington Beach because Buggs got a much more high- profile fitness job, but ""within a few months, (the relationship) started to fall apart,"" the defense attorney said.

The two had an on-again, off-again dynamic to their relationship, she said. When Buggs wanted to move on, Brewers would ""woo him back,"" she said.

Brewers would send Buggs sexually charged messages on the phone and the two would continue their romantic relationship when they were supposed to have been broken up, Hefling said.

""It's just a continuing roller coaster,"" Hefling said of the relationship. Buggs was seeking to clarify where they stood when he was searching for information on Partch.

""The torture of not knowing ... is pushing him to a place ... to find the closure he thinks he needs,"" she said.",Q2

Following the release of a draft opinion from the Supreme Court that indicates the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade is imminent, right-wing media have remained willfully obtuse about the long history of anti-abortion murders and attacks (that they, in part, contributed to) in order to substitute their own narrative about supposed violence on the left.

Instead, right-wing media have claimed that the real story is that the draft opinion leaked from the Supreme Court -- describing the leak as worse than terrorism or the insurrection on January 6.

https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2022/jun/04/shootings-expose-divisions-on-gun-issue-in-faith-communities/,Shootings expose divisions on gun issue in faith communities,"After a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, several pastors around the country challenged their conservative counterparts with this question: Are you pro-life if you are pro-gun?

One of those faith leaders is the Rev. Steven Marsh, senior pastor of Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods, California. That's where a gunman, who officials say was fueled by hate against Taiwan, opened fire on May 15 at a luncheon organized by members of the Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church, killing one and injuring five others.

""I've heard people tell me I'm not Christian because I'm pro-choice,"" Marsh said. ""I ask those people: How can you be pro-life and not support getting rid of assault rifles? You can't pick and choose where you want to be pro-life.""

Marsh's emotional statement is a vignette in the larger narrative of a nation divided on how – or if – guns should be regulated. The faith community is not monolithic on this issue.

People of faith who are tired of years of failed gun control efforts and grieving the latest mass shooting victims are pointing out what they say is hypocrisy – conservative Christians pushing to abolish abortion and grant unfettered access to guns. Those who disagree contend the real problem is sin and soft targets. It's not guns, but the ""evil"" in people and abortions that kill, they say.

These entrenched, partisan divisions in the U.S. on abortion and gun rights are stark after high-profile massacres in New York, California, Texas and elsewhere as the country awaits a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that could overturn the constitutional right to abortion.

According to 2017 Pew Research Center data analyzed for Christianity Today, 41% of white evangelicals own a gun compared to 30% of Americans overall – the highest share of any religious group. The survey also shows 74% of all gun owners in the U.S. agree that their right to gun ownership is essential to their sense of freedom. Most states also allow firearms in places of worship.

Christian author and activist Shane Claiborne disputes the notion that the U.S. has a sin problem, but not a gun problem; he says it has both. Claiborne recently went to Uvalde to support victims, and to Houston to pray and protest at the National Rifle Association's convention held days after the massacre.

He passed out tracts asserting ""We can't be pro-life and ignore gun violence"" and asking ""Will we choose the gun or the cross?"" Claiborne said he was among those asked to leave the NRA's Sunday prayer breakfast after disrupting the program to call for prayer for the Uvalde victims.

Claiborne wants to see laws change, including policies that would raise the age of gun ownership, limit magazine capacity, ban assault-style weapons and mandate training. He said laws can't make people love each other, but they can make it more difficult to take a life.

""We want to make it harder for folks to kill other people, and we're making it really easy right now,"" Claiborne said.

Conservative pastors have said mass shootings and other social harms are the result of an overall degradation in moral values and disregard for human life.

Pastor Tim Lee, an evangelist and a former U.S. Marine who lost both legs during the Vietnam War, was one of the featured speakers at the NRA prayer breakfast that Claiborne and others were asked to leave.

After the Uvalde shooting, Lee posted on his Facebook page: ""This is so heartbreaking. I have said it so many times – When kids hear adults say that it's OK to kill babies (abortion) then all respect for human lives is gone.""

The gun debate is deeply person for the Rev. Chineta Goodjoin. Her best friend, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, was one of nine people shot and killed by Dylann Roof in June 2015 as they sat in prayer at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.

Goodjoin, who leads New Hope Presbyterian Church in Anaheim, California, said people of faith must rise up in ""righteous anger"" to demand common-sense gun regulation. When massacres occur in community spaces like churches, schools and supermarkets, it tests an entire community's resiliency, she said.

""How can you teach in schools when people are traumatized by gun violence?"" she said. ""When a church is no longer a safe space, do I work to enhance security or enhance people's faith? The impact is like an epidemic that touches every fiber of our being.""

But others, like the Rev. Russ Tenhoff, say it is simply not possible to ""legislate safety.""

""There are plenty of laws, but people who are lawless don't obey them,"" said Tenhoff, lead pastor of Mountainside Community Fellowship in Kingwood, West Virginia. ""Murders are going to happen even without firearms. We're never going to be able to prevent gun violence.""

As a firearms safety officer who trains adults and children, Tenhoff says the solution is to ""harden the schools,"" which have become soft targets.

""We need to put one-way locks on schools, have metal detectors and an armed officer in every school,"" he said.

For a Catholic pastor in Newtown, Connecticut, who a decade ago experienced the grief that now envelops Uvalde, the lack of political will to enact gun legislation is unfathomable.

Monsignor Robert Weiss, who leads the St. Rose of Lima parish, presided over the funeral of eight victims who were murdered in Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012. He held an evening Mass in his church the day after the Texas shooting.

""I guess I was a fool to think Sandy Hook was going to change the world,"" he said in a video recording of the service.

Weiss also questioned the consequences of individualism in America.

""Is that what our forefathers intended for us?"" he asked. ""To live in a country where unborn babies are aborted, where children are murdered in school where they should be safe, where you can't even go to a grocery store or to a church or to a library and feel like you'll be OK?""

Pastor Mike McBride, who leads The Way Christian Center in Berkeley, California, said those on different sides of the gun issue must find common concerns to unite around and work on solutions together.

McBride says many who are pro-gun are also worried about accidental gun deaths, intimate partner violence and suicides.

""Those shared concerns can be addressed with targeted strategies that don't keep us bogged down in the Second Amendment fight,"" he said.

McBride suggests having listening campaigns across church groups and neighborhoods — a ""peace infrastructure"" to combat violence.

Marsh, the Laguna Woods pastor, says the shooting in his church and other recent massacres have inspired him to have ""more serious conversations about this issue"" in his community. He would like to see diverse faith communities organize marches in local seats of government to push legislators to act.

""Enough is enough,"" he said. ""We need to stop using Christianity as a veneer to deny reality.""

The markers, part of a university-wide project initiated by President Lee Bollinger after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, include signs at residence halls John Jay Hall and 50 Haven Avenue, formerly Bard Hall, noting that slave owners John Jay and Samuel Bard had close ties to the university.

A marker at Furnald Hall will tell the story of a morning in 1924 when men in Ku Klux Klan robes and hoods burned a seven-foot-tall wooden cross near the dormitory. Furnald was home at the time to law student Frederick W. Wells, the first Black student to live on-campus at Columbia during the academic year. While the cross burned, students ran outside his door shouting racist insults.

The high percentage of students of color, among them poet Langston Hughes, who lived at Hartley Hall in the early 20th century will be commemorated with a plaque there, according to Columbia Professor Thai Jones, who taught a “Columbia & Slavery” course and has led the effort to erect the markers.

Columbia will join Harvard Law School, Rutgers University, the University of Mississippi and the University of South Carolina in erecting plaques in recent years acknowledging the institutions’ relationship to slavery.

Columbia’s markers will be installed in the fall initially as digital monitors and could become permanent plaques, according to Jones.

Credit: Airman 1st Class Jose Miguel Tam/ US Indo-Pacific Command.

The US Air Force (USAF) 354th Fighter Wing (FW), the host unit at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, has received its final F-35A Lightning II fighter aircraft.

The arrival of the final jet marks the completion of a two-year build-up process.

The Eielson AFB now hosts two additional operational flying squadrons of 54 permanently assigned, combat-coded F-35A aircraft.

354th FW commander Colonel David Berkland said: “Finally receiving our 54th F-35 and completing our combat fleet culminates the end of a two-year beddown process that our team executed without delay, in spite of the global pandemic and our extreme Arctic environment. Today also marks Eielson as a premier, advanced airpower projection location.

“When you station the F-35 at Eielson and you have the F-22 Raptor at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, continuously working together in the JPARC with our 18th Aggressor Squadron and advanced ground training assets, you have the best training field to advance high-end airpower operations.”

The arrival of the final jet at Eielson Air Force Base also strengthens Alaska’s status as one of the most concentrated states for combat-coded, fifth-generation fighter aircraft.

Ma’ariv reported Tuesday morning that the Lapid-Bennett government has decided to sideline Internal Security Minister Barlev (Labor) in the coming Knesset emergency session on Wednesday, following a long string of humiliating faux pas. Channel 12 News reported that the Knesset will hold an emergency session in response to the wave of Arab terrorism, but Barlev will not be on hand to address challenges from the opposition parties, even though his office, which controls all the security forces save for the IDF, is the most directly involved.

According to Ma’ariv, the coalition parties have decided that since Barlev would be an easy target for the opposition speakers, the government would be represented in the debate by Communication Minister Yoaz Hendel.

Barlev has been a source of ceaseless embarrassment practically since he took office last year. This reached a peak of sorts Tuesday morning, when during an interview on Reshet Bet radio, Barlev revealed that Sayeret Matkal special force fighter Barak Sharabi, who died in a secret operation in 1984, was killed in Syrian territory – this despite a military censorship ban on the publication of information about the circumstances of his death.

Speaking on the eve of Israel’s Memorial Day, Barlev said, “Barak Sharabi, who was killed somewhere deep in Syrian territory under my command, while I was the commander of Sayeret Matkal.”

Back in 2014, Makor Rishon cited a Shin Bet agent who took part in the operation in which Sharabi was killed, who said: “The operation was very important and complex, it’s no secret that the unit’s activities are very sensitive, and exposing this incident could have exposed operational methods and directly harmed state security.”

Makor Rishon noted that “the operation that the unit embarked on went horribly wrong, which led to a difficult and prolonged rescue of the force’s soldiers, along with the dead Sharabi and eight wounded fighters. This is all we are allowed to report about the complex operation, but it would not be an exaggeration to say that if the fighters had been exposed to the enemy that night – it could have dragged Israel into war.”

השר עמר בר לב על דברי נחמן שי – “יצאנו בשלום מחודש רמדאן”: “המשטרה פעלה בתבונה ובגמישות רבה בסיטואציה הרגישה הזאת. בחודש האחרון לא היו נרצחים, בחודש שלפניו היו פיגועים קשים והמשטרה מצאה את עצמה חוצצת בגופה בין אותם טרוריסטים לאזרחי המדינה”#קלמןליברמן @KalmanLiebskind @asaf_lib pic.twitter.com/yx60JxhwEY — כאן | רשת ב (@ReshetBet) May 3, 2022

But wait, there was so much more. In the same Tuesday morning interview, Public Security Minister Barlev declared: “We came out unharmed from the month of Ramadan.” Then, to the astonishment of his interviewers, Barlev added the following:

“The police acted wisely and with great flexibility in this sensitive situation. In the last month, there have been no murders. In the month before, there were serious terrorist attacks and the police found themselves separating with its body between those terrorists and the country’s citizens.”

All heroics aside (Israeli Police and Border Guard officers did throw themselves into the fray time and again, facing up to the murderers and eliminating many of them at great cost to themselves, and several officers have been killed – DI), Barlev’s assertion that there were no terrorist murders in the month of April is even more insane than his previous declaration that violence in Judea and Samaria is perpetrated equally by settlers and PA Arab terrorists, or his sympathy tweet to the families of the fallen policemen in an operation that had no police casualties. Barlev misunderstanding of the situation on the ground during Ramadan is on a par only with his December 14, 2021 tweet: “Today I met with the Under Secretary of State of the United States, Ms. Victoria Nuland. The Under Secretary of State was interested, among other things, in settler violence and how to reduce tensions in the region and strengthen the Palestinian Authority (Terrifying: Internal Security Minister Barlev Discussed ‘Settler Violence’ with Top US Official).”

The shooting attack in a pub on Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv took place on April 7. Three Israeli men were murdered and another 14 civilians were injured. The terrorist, an Arab resident of Jenin, was killed early the next day by fighters from the Shin Bet operational unit in Jaffa, near the mosque from which he had set out the day before to carry out his murder spree.

And the shooting attack in Ariel took place on April 29. It was carried out by two PA Arab terrorists at the entrance to the city of Ariel, killing an Israeli security guard. The terrorists were caught the next day in their homes in the village of Kravat Bnei Hassan.

But there was so much more violence during the month of Ramadan (which many Israelis have taken to calling Ramadam, “dam” meaning blood). Ramadan began on April 1, and on April 2 and 3, Arabs from eastern Jerusalem (carrying an Israeli blue ID card and benefiting from the state’s plethora of social services) threw bottles and stones at Police in Damascus Gate who were securing the entrance of Muslim worshipers to the Old City and the Temple Mount.

On April 10, a terrorist was caught with a knife near the Barkan industrial zone after pulling it out on a civilian in a nearby open area. A terrorist also tried to stab several soldiers near the village of Husan, was shot in the leg, and died as a result of blood loss. A few hours later, a terrorist was shot after stabbing a soldier and lightly wounding him at the entrance to the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron.

On April 11, two Jews were shot and moderately injured, after trying to reach Joseph’s tomb outside Shechem, to clean up the place after it had been vandalized by a mob of PA Arabs.

On April 12, around 5:00 AM, an Arab infiltrator from Hebron carried out a stabbing attack at a construction site in the city of Ashkelon. A policeman was slightly injured and the terrorist was shot and killed.

On April 13, a Jew entering the village of Husan was attacked and injured by Arab rioters.

On April 15, a 15-year-old Israeli Arab stabbed and wounded a 35-year-old Jewish man in Haifa. He was caught. That same day, violent riots broke out on the Temple Mount, egged on by Hamas.

On April 17, the first day of the week of Passover, rioters threw stones at buses carrying passengers to the Kotel, mashing all the windows and injuring seven Jewish passengers. On the same day, young Arabs attacked three Jews who were walking to the Kotel wearing their prayer shawls.

And so, we must ask, is Israel’s Minister of Public Security qualified to carry out his duties? Should he be tested (Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.).

MK Itamar Ben Gvir––whom I personally would like to see take over the office of public security after this embarrassing government is toppled––issued a statement saying, “This is an extreme left-wing minister, who reveals state secrets and is not fit to serve as a minister in the State of Israel, and does not control what comes out of his mouth. Omer Barlev endangers the security of the state, not only because he surrendered to terrorism and raised a white flag in Jerusalem, but also because a person like him must not be exposed to state secrets – because as soon as he is exposed to them, he reveals them.”

MK Ben Gvir added: “In a normal country, the prime minister would have fired him immediately, and every day he remains in office he causes more damage to the security of the state.”

https://wbsm.com/worcester-man-indicted-new-bedford-rape/,Worcester Man Indicted in New Bedford Rape,"An initiative to test previously untested rape kits in Bristol County has resulted in the first indictment for a cold case rape from 2010, the Bristol County District Attorney's Office announced Friday.

A Bristol County Grand Jury has indicted 47-year-old Worcester man Scot Trudeau on aggravated rape and assault and battery charges connected to the 2010 rape of a woman in New Bedford.

In March 2010, a 23-year-old woman walking along Coffin Avenue in the North End was attacked by two men, struck in the head and then dragged to a secluded area.

One of the men held her down while the other one allegedly raped her.

The victim reported the assault to police and was taken to St. Luke's Hospital for treatment, where evidence was collected in a rape kit.

But the kit sat without being fully tested by the state lab for 12 years — one of 1,148 such kits that have yet to be tested in Bristol County, according to the D.A.'s office.

Bristol District Attorney Thomas Quinn obtained a federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative grant to start testing all of the cold case rape kits in 2019.

In February, the woman's kit was tested and the recovered DNA evidence allegedly matched a sample from Trudeau in the CODIS DNA database.

According to the D.A.'s office, if the rape kit had been fully tested in 2010, it would have pointed to Trudeau much sooner; his DNA sample was provided after a 2015 conviction for child sexual exploitation.

When she learned about the indictment, the victim ""expressed shock about the rape kit never being tested,"" the office stated, adding that she also expressed appreciation to the D.A.'s office and relief that the suspect has been identified.

The office noted that the statute of limitations on this case was due to expire in 2025.

""I am extremely pleased that our rape kit testing initiative has already resulted in indictments against this defendant for a cold case violent sexual assault committed more than a decade ago in New Bedford,"" said Quinn.

""This case demonstrates the importance of fully testing all sexual assault kits. If we did not obtain the grant to have all these kits fully tested, this case never would have been solved and the statute of limitations would have expired.""

“Victims who have been sexually assaulted have gone through a very traumatic experience and have a right to have these kits fully tested, especially when an assailant cannot be identified,"" he added.

Trudeau is currently on federal probation after serving a sentence on charges of trying to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor.

His dangerousness hearing is set for Tuesday.

The D.A.'s office revealed that it applied for the federal grant to fully test all of its untested rape kits following the 2013 conviction of John Loflin for the 2002 murder of Marlene Rose in New Bedford.

Loflin's DNA sample was provided to the CODIS database after he was arrested on unrelated charges in Tennessee in 2011, immediately matching with DNA evidence connected to Rose's murder.

He had previously been charged with a rape in New Bedford in 1997, but the case was eventually dismissed.

But the office later found that the rape kit from the 1997 case had never been fully tested by the state lab.

If it had, according to the D.A.'s office, the DNA evidence from Rose's murder would have immediately matched and Loflin would have been arrested.

The office stated that all 1,148 previously untested rape kits will likely be fully tested by the end of this year.

Quinn called the backlog of untested rape kits ""totally unacceptable, especially for victims, the public and law enforcement who believed these kits were being fully tested.""

""I am optimistic there are other cases that will be solved as a result of our rape kit initiative,"" he added.

Cassie Bowman spends her workdays writing a ghoulish true-crime blog about murdered women. Then she stumbles across a decades-old story in which the tables are turned: The woman has the secret life and the man is the murder victim. Cassie sets out to find Lore Rivera, a Laredo, Texas, woman who had two simultaneous families, one in Texas and the other in Mexico City.

She aims to write a feminist true-crime book, hoping her readers will see Lore as more than a femme fatale who wrecked two families. But as Cassie — who is keeping her own history of abuse from her fiancé, Duke — becomes intertwined with her subject, the truth and the motives grow hazier and hazier.

Katie Gutierrez’s debut novel, “More Than You’ll Ever Know,” infuses the summer mystery genre with some serious ideas about our obsession with crime stories and our sense of women’s identities.

Gutierrez, a Laredo native who grew up reading Nancy Drew, then “Fear Street” and then her mother’s Patricia Cornwell novels, didn’t get into true crime until the first season of “Serial.” “But that pushed me over the edge, followed by all the prestige documentaries,” she said in a video interview that had to be interrupted for a stretch by a sick toddler. Our talk about representation in thrillers, the ethics of true crime and the double lives we all lead has been edited for length and clarity.

What was so compelling about crime stories?

They always revolved around murdered women, kidnapped women, women in peril. It’s always women and mostly white women. Wondering why [that is] led me down a rabbit hole of investigating the cultural obsession with true crime. That led to certain unsettling conclusions, as far as who is disproportionately represented, who is allowed to be a victim. That was compelling to me as a writer.

Men are 80% of homicide victims, but when women are murdered it’s almost always by an intimate partner, which is horrifying. But Black and trans women are killed at much higher [rates]. It’s problematic to be telling those stories of white women over and over again.

Telling these stories can also create a false sense of danger, even if the danger is real in terms of sexual assault [as opposed to murder]. The disproportionate representation of women in true-crime stories doesn’t negate the fact that the most dangerous place for women is often in their homes.

Is there value in true crime when it’s done right?

Yes, when you read, say, Michelle McNamara [“I’ll Be Gone in the Dark”], you see the moral center of her investigation. True crime can ignite interest in cases that flew under the radar, maybe because the victims are not considered traditionally sympathetic, like Christine Pelisek’s “The Grim Sleeper,” where the victims were Black sex workers [in Los Angeles].

But then you read Rachel Monroe’s “Savage Appetites,” and you see a true-crime conference with people walking around with fake blood splatter shirts. And you wonder: Why are women so fascinated when it feels so gross?

One aspect I wanted to play with is that Cassie wants to write a feminist true-crime book but is so accustomed to seeing women as victims that she can’t help at some point seeing Lore as a victim.

You quote Janet Malcolm in the book on the journalist-subject relationship as a “deliberately induced delusion.” Is Cassie lying to herself about her intentions? What about you, in writing your own page-turner about secret lives and murders?

I was trying to critique the genre while using some of its tropes, but I did ask if I am accomplishing that or if I’m just complicit in all the ways I’m critiquing. I don’t have a solid answer for that. I think it’s both. You are complicit too because you’re reading it.

This story takes place on both sides of the border; the characters range from white to Mexican American to Mexican. There is plenty of untranslated Spanish, and Lore is clearly the most successful and assertive character. Yet their nationalities are not central to the story. Was that conscious?

I grew up in Laredo, a city that was 99% Mexican and Mexican American, but read one book by a Latina author until I was in college — Sandra Cisneros’ “The House on Mango Street” in seventh grade. It’s outrageous that a kid who always wrote stories and wanted to be a writer never saw that life reflected in fiction. So it was really important not to make identity an issue of trauma or oppression, to let each individual’s identity just seep through the story. I wanted Lore’s identity to center her without “othering” her and to flip the switch on what people might expect from a Mexican American woman.

We see Lore as duplicitous from the beginning, but we are initially on Cassie’s side. Then her fiancé, Duke, accuses her of being “ruthless.” Did you intend for both women to be seen as ruthless?

They’re both driven by desire, which is such a powerful force. Lore wants to be known, to be understood, which leads to this extra relationship; Cassie’s desire takes the form of ambition. And society tends to look at ambitious women as ruthless and cold, where ambitious men are seen as attractive. I don’t see female ambition as a bad thing. I want to read more about those women.

I saw Cassie as black and white in the way she constructs her justifications. It was intentional that she sees herself differently than the reader sees her. The trauma of her past informs her worldview in a way she doesn’t see.

How much do you compartmentalize in your own life?

We all do it. That was the seed of my fascination with these double-life stories, where people take compartmentalizing to extremes. Being a mother of young children during the pandemic offered less opportunity for compartmentalization — my world became very small.

So when my kids nap, I turn off the part of me that’s a mom and do my work without procrastinating. Writing a book with this larger-than-life character who lives a secret life offered that sense of escape for me during this period. You get to live that out in your mind as a writer.",Q2

As further details of the slaughter emerged from the Robb Elementary School campus on Wednesday morning, with children aged between seven and 10 the principal victims, one Washington, DC-based Jewish advocacy organization issued a call for stricter laws governing gun ownership. The accused shooter, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, had legally purchased two assault rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition to mark his birthday on May 18.

“What will be the tipping point for our country to finally act on sensible gun reform measures?” a statement from the Washington, DC,-based B’nai B’rith International asked, before listing some of the bloodiest recent episodes of gun violence in the US — from the Dec. 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut to the racially-motivated gun assault at a supermarket in Buffalo, NY, ten days ago.

“We would like to think we can never become numb to this madness,” B’nai B’rith commented. “Yet it seems our country is paralyzed by an irrational fear of taking action to stop this plague. But what about the fear now growing in more and more of our citizens: fear of going to school, of attending services at a house of worship, fear of stepping into a grocery store or a movie theater.”

The group urged the US Congress “to unite on this issue. We need sensible gun reform measures now.” The statement added that “sensible gun reform won’t stop all gun violence. But we need to start someplace. It is well past time to take that step forward.”

Other US Jewish groups offered their hopes and prayers to the grieving families, as did several Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and President Isaac Herzog.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said it was “devastated, outraged and heartbroken.” A separate statement from the American Jewish Committee (AJC) declared that “once again we feel despair, rage, and shock at another senseless act of violence,” while the World Jewish Congress (WJC) said that there were “no words to describe our sorrow and heartbreak in the wake of this senseless tragedy.”",Q2

https://www.alligator.org/article/2022/06/abortion-rights-protest,Gainesville protests overturn of Roe v. Wade,"Lavina Khan’s heart broke when she heard Roe v. Wade was overturned Friday. Her mind flooded with worries about her family members and everyone else who has a uterus; she feared they had lost control over their bodies.

The next day her heartache turned to fury as she held a sign that read “My coochie, my choice” alongside about 1,000 protestors outside the Stephan P. Mickle, Sr. Criminal Courthouse in downtown Gainesville for about three hours Saturday. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, abortion was banned in some capacity in more than 11 states, and trigger laws — abortion bans states began to enforce immediately after Roe v. Wade overturns — allow 12 other states to quickly ban or restrict access to them.

Khan, a 20-year-old UF psychology junior, said two family members needed abortions in the last three decades. One did not have the financial stability to raise a child and the other faced medical complications that could have ended both the mother’s and baby fetus’ life.

“You don't know what people are going through, and they might be in specific circumstances that don't allow them to have kids,” she said. “They might want to in the future or they might not want to at all, and it's not fair for someone else to make that decision.”

Brooke Eliazar-Macke, a 38-year-old Gainesville attorney, froze in her seat when she heard the news.

Doubts swarmed her mind. She had to reread the article before reality set in: She lost her right to an abortion.

“There's fire in your belly to continue the fight,” she said.

Eliazar-Macke helped organize the courthouse protest with the National Women’s Liberation Gainesville chapter, giving people a platform to talk about the overturn of the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision.

The NWL posed two questions to Gainesville protestors: “What do you personally need to achieve reproductive justice?” and “How has this SCOTUS decision affected you personally?”

Protestors left the courthouse to march. They passed the State Attorney's Office on their way to the Community Pregnancy Clinic, a crisis pregnancy center in midtown.

Crisis pregnancy centers are often made to look like health clinics, but are not, said Kai Christmas, the 25-year-old regional organizer for the southeast and north Florida chapter of Planned Parenthood. They wrote that unlicensed establishments, including some CPCs, don't have to abide by HIPAA.

The decision was a victory for anti-abortion activists.

“I was very thankful, obviously,” Mark Harrington, president of Created Equal, said. The public outreach organization played a role in introducing the first heartbeat bill in the nation in Ohio.

Americans are still conflicted on the topic of abortion, Harrington said, and that won’t change overnight.

The overturn of Roe v. Wade is one step of many, Harrington said. The Constitution should be amended, he said, to protect the unborn under the Fifth and 14th Amendments.

Created Equal is not counterprotesting pro-choice demonstrations, but it is conducting outreach on the streets of Washington D.C., Harrington said.

Chanae Jackson, the co-founder of Florida Forward Coalition, north central Florida’s people-powered progressive coalition, revved up the crowd with her speech about the mortality rate amongst Black children. The maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women was 2.9 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women, according to the CDC in 2020.

“I am tired of us having an abortion conversation while [Black people] are still dying from basic childbirth,” she said.

Communities must collaborate with each other to advocate for reproductive rights, Jackson said.

Protestors fought for everyone whom the overturn affects, Christmas said, which includes most women, trans people, non-binary folks, gender nonconforming folks and the BIPOC community. “All of these issues are intertwined,” Christmas said. “We have to show up for each and every single one of them.”

Bread and Roses and All Women’s Health Centers, offer abortion services within three miles of campus.

https://dallasvoice.com/6-north-texans-among-31-white-supremacists-arrested-in-coeur-dalene/,6 North Texans among 31 white supremacists arrested in Coeur d’Alene,"Thomas Ryan Rousseau. Mug shot from the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office in Idao.

Six men from the DFW area were among the 31 Patriot Front members arrested Saturday, June 11, in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, as they were on their way to disrupt a Pride celebration happening there. The arrests came one day before the sixth anniversary of the June 12, 2016, massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in which 49 people were murdered.

According to reports by CBS News, the 31 men, carrying “riot gear” were arrested after someone called police to say they had seen people “loading up into a U-Haul like ‘a little army’ at a hotel parking lot in Coeur d’Alene.”

Thomas Ryan Rousseau, 23, of Grapevine, who has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the person who founded the Patriot Front following the deadly United The Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, was among those arrested and charged with misdemeanor conspiracy to riot.

The five other North Texans arrested in Coeur d’Alene, also on criminal conspiracy charges, were Graham Jones Whitsom, aka Whitson, 31, of Haslet; Kieran Padraig Morris, 27 of Haslet, Steven Derrick Tucker, 30, of Haslet; Josiah Daniel Buster, 24, of Watauga and Connor Patrick Moran, 23, of Watauga.

A seventh Texan, Robert Benjamin Whitted, was also among those arrested Saturday in Coeur d’Alene.

All seven men have bonded out of jail.

George Washington University researcher Jon Lewis told CBS News that Patriot Front is a white supremacist neo-Nazi group whose members see Blacks, Jews and LGBTQ people as their enemies.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which lists Patriot Front as a hate group, “Patriot Front is an image-obsessed organization that rehabilitated the explicitly fascist agenda of Vanguard America with garish patriotism. Patriot Front focuses on theatrical rhetoric and activism that can be easily distributed as propaganda for its chapters across the country.”

SPLC on its website includes quotes from the Patriot Front manifesto that declare “The time of the Republic has passed in America as the system grows too weak to perform its duty,” and that “Democracy has failed this once great nation.”

Echoes of the “great replacement theory” which reportedly motivated the gunman who murdered 10 people in a racially-motivated mass shooting May 14 at a Buffalo, N.Y, grocery store are evident in a quote from a Patriot Front rally at the University of Texas at Austin in November 2017: “America, our nation stands before an existential threat. The lives of your children, and your children’s children, and your prosperity beyond that, dangle above a den of vipers. A corrupt rootless, global, and tyrannical elite has usurped your democracy and turned it into a weapon, first to enslave and then to replace you.”

SPLC explains that Rousseau attended the 2017 Unite the Right rally as a part of Vanguard America, another group listed as a hate group by SPLCA, and that he led VA members during the rally, including James Alex Fields Jr., the man who rammed his car into counter-protesters, killing Heather Heyer.

Rousseau broke away and formed Patriot Front after the Charlottesville disaster due to a feud with VA leader Dillon Irizarry, according to SPLC.

All three Haslet residents — Whitsom, Morris and Tucker — were listed in Coeur d’Alene arrest records as living at the same address in Haslet. According to publicly available records at the Tarrant Appraisal District website and on the real estate site Zillow.com, the property was purchased in November 2020, and is currently owned, by a Houston couple, who rent the home out.

Records show that Buster and Moran both live at the same address in Watauga in a residence purchased by Buster in July 2021. Rousseau lives in Grapevine in a home owned by Thomas C. Rousseau, public records show.

https://www.natlawreview.com/article/seventh-circuit-affirms-summary-judgment-ruling-against-illinois-employee-who,Seventh Circuit Interprets Illinois Whistleblower Act,"A recent Seventh Circuit decision interpreting Illinois law affirmed the district court’s ruling that an employee’s refusal to engage in activity illegal in New York, but not in Illinois, was neither protected under the Illinois Whistleblower Act (“IWA”) nor under a common-law retaliatory discharge theory.

In Perez v. Staples Contract & Commercial, LLC, Perez, a sales representative with a documented history of poor performance, worked on an account that involved the sale of laundry detergent in New York. The supplier recommended a product, but later warned that its sale in New York was illegal due to its chemical makeup. Perez advised his supervisor that he did not feel comfortable selling an illegal product, and his supervisor told him he would “take care of it.” Perez was terminated a few months later for poor sales production.

Perez then sued, alleging various claims including: (1) retaliation under the IWA; and (2) common-law retaliatory discharge. The district court ruled that the New York regulation prohibiting the sale of products containing the chemical did not trigger an IWA retaliatory discharge claim. Rather, such a claim arises only when a “clearly established policy of Illinois” is at issue. Further, the district court found no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Perez had participated in any protected activity under the IWA, as well as insufficient evidence of retaliatory motive to defeat summary judgment.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s summary judgment ruling, holding that Perez did not engage in a protected activity. First, under the IWA, “an employer may not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation.” 740 ILCS 174/20. There are two aspects to such a claim: (1) the refusal to participate; and (2) the violation of a statute, rule, or regulation. There was no dispute that the detergent’s sale in New York violated a New York state regulation. However, Perez’s whistleblower claim did not involve “Illinois” law, as required by the use of the term “State” in the IWA, which refers to Illinois, not any other state such as New York. Since the sale of the product did not violate Illinois law, Perez’s actions were not protected.

Second, Illinois common law prohibits an employer from terminating an employee if the termination violates a clear mandate of public policy. A clear mandate is something that “strikes at the heart of a citizen’s social rights, duties, and responsibilities.” Palmateer v. Int’l Harvester Co., 421 N.E.2d 876, 878-79 (Ill. 1981). Perez argued that Illinois environmental law also regulates the sale of detergents, so it is a matter of public policy in Illinois. However, the Seventh Circuit rejected this contention, because “there is no analog to the New York regulation within the Illinois statutory and regulatory regime.” Consequently, Perez’s termination did not violate a clear mandate of public policy, because refusing to violate New York environmental law “did not implicate any interest related to ‘a social duty or responsibility’ or the ‘health and welfare’ of Illinois citizens.” And, the Seventh Circuit noted, that even if the district court’s reasoning was not correct, there was still insufficient evidence to support an inference of a retaliatory motive given that Perez had a track record of failing to meet performance expectations.",Q2

MICHIGAN, USA — A wind energy company was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after at least 150 eagles were killed over the past decade at its wind farms in eight states, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.

NextEra Energy subsidiary ESI Energy pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act during a Tuesday court appearance in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was charged criminally in the deaths of nine eagles at three of its wind farms in Wyoming and New Mexico.

In addition to those deaths, ESI acknowledged the deaths of golden and bald eagles at 50 wind farms affiliated with ESI and NextEra since 2012. The birds died in eight states, prosecutors said: Wyoming, California, New Mexico, North Dakota, Colorado, Michigan, Arizona and Illinois.

The birds are killed when they fly into the blades of wind turbines. Some ESI turbines killed multiple eagles and because the carcasses are not always found, officials said the number killed was likely higher than the 150 birds cited by prosecutors in court documents.

NextEra's plea deal comes amid a push by President Joe Biden for more renewable energy from wind, solar and other sources to help reduce climate changing emissions. It also follows a renewed commitment by federal wildlife officials under Biden to enforce protections for eagles and other birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, after criminal prosecutions were halted under former President Donald Trump.

It's illegal to kill or harm eagles under federal law.

The bald eagle — the U.S. national symbol — was removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act in 2007, following a dramatic recovery from widespread decimation due to harmful pesticides and other problems. Wildlife officials say more than 300,000 bald eagles now occupy the U.S., not including Alaska.

Golden eagles have not fared as well, with populations considered stable but under pressure from wind farms, collisions with vehicles, illegal shootings and poisoning from lead ammunition. There are an estimated 31,800 golden eagles in the Western U.S., according to a study released last week by leading eagle researchers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other entities.

More than 2,000 golden eagles are killed annually due to human causes, or about 60% of all deaths, the researchers said. The study concluded that golden eagle deaths ""will likely increase in the future"" because of wind energy development and other human activities.

Companies historically have been able to avoid prosecution under the century-old Migratory Bird Treaty if they take steps to avoid bird deaths and seek permits for those that occur. ESI did not seek such a permit, authorities said.

The company was warned prior to building the wind farms in New Mexico and Wyoming that they would kill birds, but it proceeded anyway and at times ignored advice from federal wildlife officials about how to minimize the deaths, according to court documents.

""For more than a decade, ESI has violated (wildlife) laws, taking eagles without obtaining or even seeking the necessary permit,"" said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement.

ESI agreed under a plea deal to spend up to $27 million during its five-year probationary period on measures to prevent future eagle deaths. That includes shutting down turbines at times when eagles are more likely to be present.

Despite those measures, wildlife officials anticipate that some eagles still could die. When that happens, the company will pay $29,623 per dead eagle, under the agreement.

NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said collisions of birds with wind turbines are unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized. She said the Juno Beach, Florida-based company —which bills itself as the world's largest utility company by market value — is committed to reducing damage to wildlife from its projects.

""We disagree with the government's underlying enforcement activity,"" Kujawa said in a statement. ""Building any structure, driving any vehicle, or flying any airplane carries with it a possibility that accidental eagle and other bird collisions may occur.""

http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/183058,World Socialist Website: Tim Snyder Changes Conclusions on Ukrainian Fascism,"An article, posted today online and printed in the New York Times Sunday Magazine, is yet another deplorable example of Professor Timothy Snyder’s role as a historical falsifier and apologist for Ukrainian fascism.

Snyder mockingly dismisses Russian references to Ukrainian nationalists’ mass murder of Poles and Jews during World War II as “a past that never happened” and “nonsensical and necrophiliac accounts of history.”

But at an earlier stage of his career, Snyder wrote detailed accounts of the genocidal activities of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). His article, “The Causes of Ukrainian-Polish Ethnic Cleansing 1943,” appeared in the May 2003 edition of Past and Present.

This 37-page scholarly article focused on the OUN’s mass killing of Poles in Volhynia. The OUN’s military wing, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army [UPA], wrote Snyder, “killed about fifty thousand Volhynian Poles and forced tens of thousands to flee in 1943.”

“By the end of April 1943,” according to Snyder’s account, “the UPA had perhaps ten thousand soldiers under its command, and had reduced much of Volhynia to mutual slaughter.” Snyder continued:

Throughout April and throughout Volhynia, UPA soldiers surrounded colonies and villages, burned houses, shot or forced back inside those who tried to escape. In mixed settlements, the UPA’s security services warned Ukrainians to flee by night, then killed everyone remaining at dawn. This was a co-ordinated attack by armed men upon a leaderless and disorganized population.

This was not Snyder’s only “necrophiliac account” of mass murder by Ukrainian nationalists. In an article published in February 2010 in the New York Review of Books, Snyder explicitly denounced then Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko’s cover-up of OUN crimes.",Q2

https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2022/0516/For-many-women-defending-Roe-1973-decision-is-a-living-memory,"For many women defending Roe, 1973 decision is a living memory","“I cannot believe it’s the 21st century, and we have to fight this again,” says Lauri Shreve, barely in her 60s, shaking her head in disbelief, in the shadow of the Washington Monument.

It was a sentiment repeated over and over Saturday, in hundreds of cities across the country, as abortion-rights protesters rallied. After nearly 50 years, the nationwide right to abortion appears set to end, following the recent leak of a draft ruling that would overturn the 1973 precedent, Roe v. Wade.

For the first time in her life, Ms. Shreve says, “I had to march.” She and her husband, Randy, who own a landscaping business, traveled 2 1/2 hours from Cumberland, Maryland, to take part in the Washington protest.

Why We Wrote This It may seem like a paradox, but many of the women who turned out for abortion-rights protests this past weekend were beyond their childbearing years. One distinction: Some have memories of a pre-Roe America.

“I actually had to tell [my grown daughters] how important this was,” Ms. Shreve says. “They didn’t see the big picture, that never before has a constitutional right been taken away.”

The thousands who rallied near the monument and marched to the Supreme Court were a diverse group in many ways, including gender, age, and race. But perhaps most striking was the large number of “women of a certain age” – those in their 50s and beyond. Women no longer in their childbearing years, but who felt so passionately about the possible demise of Roe that they had to do something public.

Linda Feldmann/The Christian Science Monitor Randy and Lauri Shreve of Cumberland, Maryland, stand with their homemade signs at the abortion-rights rally and march in Washington on May 14, 2022.

Many younger women, of course, were here, too. Some came with friends, others with parents, husbands, partners, small children. A few were visibly pregnant, some making a point: They were having a baby by choice.

But the large number of older women in the crowd points to a possible paradox: that older women who favor abortion rights, many with firsthand memories of life before Roe, may feel more intensely about the possible loss of that right than the women who could be directly affected.

“Younger people didn’t grow up in a non-Roe world,” says Jennifer Butler, a 50-something Presbyterian minister and outgoing CEO of the advocacy group Faith in Public Life, standing near the “faith tent” at Saturday’s “Bans Off Our Bodies” rally. “They’ve always taken that right pretty much for granted.”

For older American women, the memories can be visceral – the illegal and sometimes dangerous abortions they or their friends had; the women who died from a botched abortion; the sadness and shame of giving birth as a teenager, then in some cases placing the baby for adoption; the fight to make abortion legal nationwide.

Part of the paradox is that many polls show younger women are generally more supportive of abortion rights than older women. A March survey by the Pew Research Center found that support for abortion rights at six weeks of pregnancy is strongest among the youngest women and declines with age – 61% among women ages 18 to 29 versus 38% among women over 65.

Then there’s the importance of abortion as a “voting issue.” This could be critical in the November midterm elections, with Republicans – who typically oppose abortion rights – already with the wind at their backs. Combined Gallup data from between 2014 and 2021 show that among female voters age 55 and over who identify as “pro-life,” 27% vote only for candidates who share their views; among women in this age cohort who consider themselves “pro-choice,” the figure is 20%. But among younger voters, it’s women who identify as “pro-choice” who say more often than their “pro-life” sisters that they will vote only for candidates with whom they agree on abortion.

Linda Feldmann/The Christian Science Monitor Jennifer Butler (left), outgoing CEO of the advocacy group Faith in Public Life, and Jeanné Lewis, who will become CEO on June 1, stand near the ""faith tent"" at the abortion rally in Washington on May 14, 2022.

This raises the next question: Can Democrats use the overturning of Roe, expected next month, as a tool to galvanize young voters – a cohort notorious for not turning out in midterms – to vote in the November midterm elections?

For now, abortion-rights advocates are working every demographic they can, and see ground for mutual learning – not just the older women teaching the younger about life before Roe, but also younger women teaching their elders about modern-day advocacy, including the use of technology and social media, and about the changing rhetoric.

“Students are much more likely to talk about reproductive justice than abortion rights,” says Laury Oaks, chair of the department of feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “I want to focus on the unity, the coming together, the places of consensus over the places of difference.”

Standing outside the Supreme Court after marching down the Mall in Washington on Saturday, two middle-aged women are discussing generational differences in approaches to activism on abortion.

“There are fewer young people here than I would have expected,” says 50-something Samantha Shofar from Silver Spring, Maryland. “Maybe they’re just complacent.”

Her friend Cindy Jacobs sees something larger at play.

“There have been several years of things just eroding,” says Ms. Jacobs, also in her 50s and from Silver Spring. “Democracy is crumbling and rights are crumbling – and it’s leading to this path of something even worse.”

Ms. Shofar’s 25-year-old daughter is in Israel, she says – otherwise, she would have been here to protest. But her other child, who she says is nonbinary, “has what I consider a very nihilistic view. And I think it could be somewhat typical of this generation. They don’t think anything good is going to happen.”

The view from Austin

Patricia Kruger, standing on the grounds of the Texas Capitol in Austin on Saturday, holds a sign that says simply, “1973.”

It is a reference to the year the Supreme Court found, in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution’s concept of personal “liberty” protections included a woman’s right to choose abortion.

Taking part in the Austin protest, where the crowd numbered in the hundreds, seemed to carry extra meaning: Roe was based on a Texas case, and in 2021, the so-called Texas Heartbeat Act dramatically curtailed the right to abortion in the state to about six weeks’ gestational age – far shorter than the 2018 Mississippi law that is currently before the court and the vehicle for Roe’s likely demise.

Henry Gass/The Christian Science Monitor Patricia Kruger holds a sign celebrating 1973, the year the Supreme Court recognized the right to abortion, at a protest outside the Texas Capitol. “I have a daughter, and I think it’s important to fight for her future,” Ms. Kruger says.

To the protesters in Austin, as elsewhere in the country, the message is simple.

“I have a daughter, and I think it’s important to fight for her future,” Ms. Kruger says, noting that her views haven’t changed over time. She recalls writing a “pro-choice” article in high school 30 years ago.

“We’ve come a long way since then – but we’re moving backwards, and this is a very scary time,” Ms. Kruger says.

Some of the women here are old enough to remember friends going out of state – or out of the country – for an abortion.

“When I was in high school in Ohio, I had a friend who got pregnant despite being careful, and they had to go to New York because it wasn’t legal in Ohio,” says protester Carol Goodwin.

Bonnie, a University of Texas grad who declined to give her last name, shares a similar story: “I had a roommate at college who had to go to Mexico to get an abortion, and it was very dangerous.”

There’s also nuance to protesters’ views.

“I’m disabled, and the concept of carrying a pregnancy to term is not viable for me,” says Caitlin Dalton.

“We look at abortion as one thing; it’s about aborting this potential life,” she adds, tugging at the grass as she talks. “I understand people who feel sincerely about that. But I want people to understand this will affect many different things; it will lead to many other dangerous things.”

Her mother, Tiffany Almeida, seems to have a more brass-tacks approach: “Women are waking up,” she says, suggesting that “women start taking their money and their skills out of states they don’t agree with.”

A first time protesting in Washington

Back in Washington, 60-something Julie is wearing the pink hat she wore at her hometown women’s march back in January 2017.

She asks to withhold her last name, out of fear that protesters “will look me up.” And for the record, she says she opposes the protesters who have shown up at the homes of conservative Supreme Court justices over the expected overturning of Roe. Others at the march make the same point.

This is the first Washington protest Julie has ever attended.

“I’ve never felt like I had to,” Julie says, mentioning that she had a medically unsustainable pregnancy that had to be terminated, before having her son. “I’m not for abortion, but I’m not against it. I’m for the right to choose. ... Just being able to make our choices about our bodies. And it’s a lot more than just a physical body. It’s your mental state. It’s your family situation. It’s your financial situation.”

Marge Matthews, who’s in her 80s and here with her 60-something daughter, is a veteran of marches – against the Vietnam War and for women’s rights. Her observation of how younger protesters are behaving at the march: “They’re more outspoken. They say it like it is – dirty language and all.”

Indeed, many of the homemade posters on display here are not suitable for a family newspaper.

But generational change is inevitable. The organization Faith in Public Life is about to get a new CEO, as Ms. Butler shifts to “founder-in-residence.”

Jeanné Lewis, who is in her early 40s and Roman Catholic, will take over on June 1. She seems excited about the possibilities – of seeing people of faith who support abortion rights come to the fore and discover their agency in the event that Roe is overturned.

“There’s a lot of mythology around who’s having an abortion and why,” she says. And the move in some states to ban abortion without exceptions for rape and incest, she adds, is only pushing more people into their camp.

She says that 1 in 4 women have had or will have an abortion, and the majority are mothers, or will be mothers.

“I’m not sure that everyone is clear about the implications” of the Supreme Court’s pending action, Ms. Lewis says. “I have never lived in a world without Roe v. Wade. And because there’s still so much stigma attached to having an abortion, there aren’t a lot of narratives.”",Q2

Director of Marketing & Communications, Daytona State College

In front of an audience of more than 200 students, faculty, staff and members of the community, Daytona State College officials cut the ceremonial ribbon to mark the completion of the new student residence hall on May 5. Located on the Daytona Beach Campus, the four story, 252-bed facility opens its doors to DSC’s first-ever on-campus residents this summer. The residence hall was designed to be an affordable option within reach for all students, including those on financial aid and scholarships.

“Today marks the end of one chapter in the life of our college and begins a new one, with fresh ideas, hopes, and dreams for the future,” said Dr. Tom LoBasso, DSC president. “The impact this facility will have on our campus life will be unmistakable. In this era where everyone wants to be online, the residence hall will help build stronger relationships between faculty and students. It will strengthen the ties with our future alumni and create a positive feedback loop that will in turn make us stronger.”

The campus infrastructure is in place for a full college residential experience, and includes amenities such as a dining facility with meal plans, a fitness center, pool, and recreational areas. Student housing is projected to increase student retention as support services such as tutoring, the library, Writing Center, Academic Support Center, and Career Services, are all within walking distance from the facility.

“We were confident that many of our students, including local students, would want to take advantage of a residential experience,” said Dr. Randy Howard, DSC District Board of Trustees Chair. “Living in the heart of this campus where they can fully immerse themselves in their educational experience – close to faculty, recreational facilities, our wonderful student center and library – this is one more example of how Daytona State keeps the needs of our students at the forefront of everything we do.”

The largest percentage of the incoming residents are from Volusia, Flagler, Seminole, Orange, Hillsborough and Pasco counties. Other states represented are New York, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia, Colorado, and Texas, and international students will come from Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, the Bahamas, Brazil, Spain, and Australia.

“We are a community dedicated to uplifting one another on our journeys to success, celebrating our diversity, and creating an unforgettable college experience,” said Adrianne Toles-Williams, SGA president. “The Student Residence Hall makes this more than just a college campus, it will make Daytona State College in Daytona Beach a home.”",Q2

As a young man, Malik Muhammad believed he would return home to Washington, D.C., with his USC degree to embark on a quiet career in federal government jobs.

Then books came along and shook Muhammad’s foundation. Books that challenged his conceptions of Black history — it “didn’t start with just slavery; that’s what I thought” — and opened his eyes to the urgency of social issues.

“Books sparked me,” he said. “They elevated me. They changed my consciousness. It made me feel different about the way I looked at myself; I had a degree, but I didn’t have a knowledge of self.”

In 1990, Muhammad opened Malik Books. For 32 years, his customers have come to the store to find more than titles by Black authors: “They come here to see themselves, to find representation of themselves.”

In California, Malik Books is among a dozen bookstores listed by the African American Literature Book Club that serve as crucial access points to messages about Black history, culture and community.

That list will soon shrink by one . The owners of Eso Won Books in Leimert Park announced they will close their physical store by the end of the year , though they’ll continue selling books online. The famed retailer in the (quickly-gentrifying) Leimert Park neighborhood has hosted talks and book signings by luminaries ranging from former President Barack Obama to journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates to actress Issa Rae.

Muhammad himself has bought books from Eso Won — which opened around the same time — and often refers customers to the store when they sell a title Malik Books doesn’t have. He says Black-owned booksellers serve an important role.

“Eso Won, Malik Books — we exist because our voice has been silent,” Muhammad said. “The reason we opened is to amplify our voice, to tell our story, to help our community. We’re book activists.”

April Muhammad, the store’s co-owner and Malik’s wife, said bigger booksellers may carry some of the more popular titles — but Black authors are often relegated to a small section of the store.

“When you walk into a bookstore, you should be able to see yourself in all facets.” “When you come into Malik Books, you see yourself everywhere,” said April Muhammad.

So what’s a title that Malik Books exists to sell — a less well-known title that big retailers are less likely to carry? April doesn’t hesitate to answer, walking immediately to a shelf in the center aisle of the small store.

“This book has saved many peoples’ lives,” April said, pulling out a copy of The Message to the Blackman in America by Elijah Muhammad, the founder of The Nation of Islam.

Malik says the bookstore exists to sell a book like PowerNomics by Claud Anderson. The book’s message echoes many of Malik’s feelings about the importance of economic growth in the Black community.

“Freedom isn’t just being physically free,” he explained. “Financial freedom is liberation. So we need to pool money together” — which, Muhammad argued, means supporting Black-owned businesses.

In a turbulent industry, running Malik Books hasn’t always been easy. Muhammad said he opened the store during a moment when literature about multiculturalism was ascendant. But by the 2000s, many of the same forces that whipsawed independent book-sellers everywhere began battering his store: the rise of Amazon and big-box book-sellers.

But Muhammad said the reckoning over racism that’s followed George Floyd’s murder has been a “catalyst” for new interest in Black authors and books.

“History repeats itself until you get it right,” Malik Muhammad said. “We have to make it right.”

https://www.oxygen.com/an-unexpected-killer/crime-news/jackie-gaimari-greco-helped-kill-husband-carl-greco,Jackie Gaimari Greco Helped Kill Husband Carl Greco,"Jackie and Carl Gaimari had an untraditional but loving relationship when two burglars killed him in 1979. But 30 years later, her sister helped police prove there was more to the story.

Becky Gaimari, just 15 years old, called the police when she got home from school on April 30, 1979.

How to Watch Catch up on An Unexpected Killer on Peacock or the Oxygen App.

“Her words were: ‘There’s been a robbery, my dad’s been shot,’” Inverness Police Detective Bill Stutzman told “An Unexpected Killer,” airing Fridays at 8/7c on Oxygen.

“As we entered through the front door, we were met by Becky Gaimari,” Barrington Police Department Deputy Marshall Scott Davis told ""An Unexpected Killer."" (The Inverness Police Department was re-established in 2009, according to the Chicago Tribune, after it had been outsourced to the nearby town of Barrington starting in 1975.) “She was crying and pointing downstairs. I went downstairs and saw a male who was leaning back in the sofa who appeared to have numerous gunshot wounds.""

Jacquelyn ""Jackie"" Gaimari was crying at the feet of her husband, Carl Gaimari, a 35-year-old trader at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT).

Officers moved the family, which included 13-year-old daughter Bobbi, 5-year-old daughter Carli and 2-year-old son Nick, out of the home in order to secure the crime scene — and get some answers about the murder.

They learned Carl had gone to work while Jackie was home with the kids and Becky was at school. Bobbi had been on the couch watching TV at around 12:30 when two men wearing stocking masks and dark clothing came in through the back door, which had been unlocked.

“They point the guns at her,” said Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office prosecutor Maria McCarthy. “And they ask her, 'Where’s your mother?' So Bobbie leads these men to the master bedroom where Jackie is on the phone. They ask Jackie for her money, and she says, ‘I only have $20,’ and they said, ‘We’re here for more than that.’”

The men tied them up and put them in the closet. When Becky came home at around 3, she heard crying and found her family banging on the closet doors.

“Once Becky opens up the closet doors, Bobbie went directly down to the basement and Bobbie found her father’s bloody, bullet-ridden body laying on that couch,” said McCarthy.

The widow and her daughter helped police create composite sketches as other investigators canvassed the neighborhood.

Back at the crime scene, a family friend appeared.

“I noticed someone approached me and he pulled out his credentials as being a Chicago police officer and told his name was Sam Greco,” said Davis, who was still at the crime scene. “Sam said that he was a family friend. The girls knew Sam, they felt comfortable around him.”

Greco was also a rather famous Chicago Police Department hero: In 1969, according to the Chicago Tribune, Greco was shot three times in the course of apprehending Pete Ristich, 57, a member of the Friday Night Gang that had become known for holding up bars. He was made a detective from his hospital bed but, due to his injuries, was unable to return to the force until 1975. (He left the force on disability in 1979 after the Gaimari murder.)

“He said that he had been called by the daughter [Becky], that something had happened so he was coming out to see what assistance he could lend,” Inverness Police Detective Mike Kirby told ""An Unexpected Killer."" “He had advised them that he had been on the phone with Jackie — this is about 12:30 in the afternoon —and that, during their conversation, she said that somebody was there and he heard some voices in the background and then the call was disconnected.""

The records of the two calls between Greco and the Gaimari house showed the time frame of the burglary and murders was between 12:30 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. The amount of time they spent in the house was long and many items of value hadn't been taken, so it left police officers questioning what the motive really was. Investigators decided to talk to Jackie in more depth, where they learned more about their marriage.

“Carl and Jackie had a rather unorthodox situation at times,” said McCathy. “Over the years, they both had affairs and they would bring their lovers home.”

Jackie told police that, by 1979, the couple had decided to re-commit to monogamy and one another — including renewing their wedding vows. She said that she'd broken off the relationship with Greco around the time she'd gotten pregnant with her youngest son, Nick, but the two had remained friendly.

Police then interviewed Greco.

“He had met Jackie at a wedding and he was doing some private investigative work and Jackie had hired him to follow Carl to see if he was having an affair,"" said Kirby. ""There was an indication from Sam’s investigation that Carl was having an affair.”

That was when they struck up a romantic relationship. Greco confirmed that the two had ended the affair and remained friends, and police concluded he was not a suspect after he allowed them to take fingerprints and go through his phone records.

Leads were starting to dry up: None of the fingerprints from the crime scene matched, the composite sketches released to the media resulted in no tips, and, it turned out, Carl was shot with two guns the burglars had taken from the master bedroom closet when they locked the rest of the family up, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“A couple days after the original murder, somebody had put a threatening note in the mailbox,” said Davis. “Jackie went to the police and said she was being threatened and that was her concern for her safety.”

Police weren't able to tie anyone to the note, but Greco moved in with the Gaimari family a week after the murder, the Tribune reported.

Jacquelyn Greco

The case went cold — and stayed that way for 30 years.

Meanwhile, Jackie and Sam Greco married four months after Carl's murder and moved to California, which Greco told the Tribune was to help with the chronic lung infections that had scuttled his police career.

But by 1986, he told the paper that he'd missed Chicago and the police force and the family moved back to Chicago. Greco soon got his wish and rejoined the force in 1987, after passing a battery of fitness tests. 1987 was also the year that Carl Gaimari's estate finished going through probate, as he'd died without a will, according to the Tribune. Jackie Gaimari Greco, the paper reported, collected more than $600,000 once the estate settled, not including the value of the house.

They invested at least part of it in a bar on Chicago's North Side, but divorced in 1990. (According to the Daily Herald, the bar burned down in an arson for which no one was ever prosecuted; Jackie told police that the building hadn't been properly insured and the fire ultimately bankrupted her, according to the Tribune.)

The murder still haunted the family. Bobbie Gaimari, who was locked in the closet with her mom and was the first to find her father's body, ultimately died by suicide in 2009, which the family attributed to her guilt over having assumed that she left the back door open on the day her father was killed, according to the Daily Herald. Becky Gaimari Wykel developed an addiction problem, which she eventually overcame.

After the Inverness Police Department was reconstituted in 2009, Stutzman and Kirby were asked to take on the cold case murder of Carl Gaimari. At the time, they were not sure if there would still be witnesses left alive — and they discovered that all the physical evidence in the case, including the cigarette butt recovered from the scene and the fingerprints, were destroyed in two floods in the Barrington Police Department basement.

So Kirby and Stutzman reinterviewed everyone who could be reinterviewed.

“One of the people who they reinterviewed was Jackie’s sister, Tootsie,” said McCarthy. (Tootsie's given name is Elsie Fry.)

“She said, ‘I’ve been ridden with guilt throughout the years. I’ve seen what it did to the kids, what it did to his family. I can only be truthful about this, I can only tell you what was told to me,’” said Stutzman.

She explained that two months prior to the murder Jackie had said she had fallen out love with Carl and wanted to get rid of him.

“Jackie said to Tootsie, ‘We’ve found a way to get rid of Carl,’” said McCarthy. “‘We’re going to make it look like a home invasion. Some men are going to come in, they’re going to tie me up, and they’re going to wait for Carl to come home and kill him.’”

Tootsie told her she shouldn't do that and should just divorce him. But Jackie said divorce would mean she didn't get all the money.

Police convinced Tootsie to try to coax Jackie into admitting what she'd done while they recorded it.

“I’m not doing good, honey,” Tootsie said in one police recording. “The police have been here about Carl, and they’ve been asking me a lot of questions and they’re saying I might have to go in front of the grand jury. I don’t know if you remember what you told me?”

“I do,” said Jackie, “But, are you going to do that to me?”

“I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to,” said Tootsie.

“Oh my God,” said Jackie. “Just tell them that I wished he was dead. Don’t tell them I said that, please.”

“I already… they already know, Jackie,” said Tootsie. “You told me how it was going to be done, how they were going to break in and tie you up and put you in the closet and then kill Carl.”

“You gotta help me, Tootsie,” said Jackie, almost crying. “I can’t go to jail, you gotta help me.”

“I can’t lie,” said Tootsie, her voice breaking. “I can’t lie.”

Police got a warrant for Jackie's arrest and brought Jackie back in for questioning. After hearing the recordings, Jackie admitted there had been a plan but claimed that she had backed out of it long before Carl's murder.

Jackie was charged with first-degree murder on March 27, 2013 and went to trial in October 2016. After days of testimony — including from her daughter Becky — she was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison, according to the Tribune.

Kirby told ""An Unexpected Killer"" that the hero cop implicated in the case, Sam Greco — who Jackie repeatedly implicated at trial — was not charged because he died of natural causes.

An obituary in the Chicago Sun-Times indicates that Greco died in March 2018.

Gaimari-Greco's conviction was overturned on appeal in 2020 when the court ruled that the jury had not received proper instructions about how to consider her claims that she'd withdrawn from the murder plot before Carl was killed. She pleaded guilty to murder in 2021 in exchange for a 22-year sentence under 1979 terms, which would allow her to be released relatively early, according to the Daily Herald.

She is currently incarcerated in the Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln, Illinois, according to jail records. She's eligible for parole in March 2024, and is scheduled for release in March 2027.

https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2022/may/27/romance-writer-guilty-of-murdering-husband/,Romance writer guilty of murdering husband,"PORTLAND, Ore. -- A jury in Portland has convicted a self-published romance novelist -- who once wrote an essay titled ""How to Murder Your Husband"" -- of fatally shooting her husband four years ago.

The jury of seven women and five men found Nancy Crampton Brophy, 71, guilty of second-degree murder Wednesday after deliberating over two days in chef Daniel Brophy's death, KOIN-TV reported.

Brophy, 63, was killed June 2, 2018, as he prepped for work at the Oregon Culinary Institute in Southwest Portland.

Crampton Brophy displayed no visible reaction Wednesday inside the crowded Multnomah County courtroom.

Lisa Maxfield, one of Crampton Brophy's attorneys, said the defense team plans to appeal.

Prosecutors told jurors that Crampton Brophy was motivated by money problems and a life insurance policy.

Crampton Brophy said during the trial, however, that she had no reason to kill her husband and that their financial problems had largely been solved by cashing in a chunk of Brophy's retirement savings plan.

She owned the same make and model of gun used to kill her husband and was seen on surveillance camera footage driving to and from the culinary institute, court exhibits and court testimony showed.

Police never found the gun that killed Brophy. Prosecutors alleged Crampton Brophy swapped out the barrel of the gun used in the shooting and then discarded the barrel.

Defense attorneys said the gun parts were inspiration for Crampton Brophy's writing and suggested someone else might have killed Brophy during a robbery gone wrong. Crampton Brophy testified during the trial that her presence near the culinary school on the day of her husband's death was mere coincidence and that she had parked in the area to work on her writing.

Crampton Brophy's how-to treatise detailed various options for committing an untraceable killing and professed a desire to avoid getting caught. Circuit Judge Christopher Ramras ultimately excluded the essay from the trial, noting it was published in 2011. A prosecutor, however, alluded to the essay's themes without naming it after Crampton Brophy took the stand.

Crampton Brophy has remained in custody since her arrest in September 2018, several months after her husband was shot. Her sentencing has been scheduled for June 13.",Q2

https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/story/news/local/2022/04/22/former-korean-war-mia-rests-maryland-roy-charles-delauter-army/7293983001/,Long missing Korean War veteran Roy DeLauter finally at rest in Maryland,"For years Sue Draper has placed flowers on Memorial Day at the marker for her father, former Korean War MIA Sgt. Roy ""Buddy"" Charles DeLauter, at Cedar Lawn Memorial Park.

This May when she lays those flowers, she'll know he's actually there, she said after the funeral and burial service Friday for DeLauter.

The day came on what would have been DeLauter's 93rd birthday.

The Smithsburg-area man's remains, identified in January, arrived home to Washington County and Rest Haven Funeral Home from Hawaii on a cold, windy Tuesday evening.

On a warm Friday, the sun shone through a partly cloudy sky as the funeral procession arrived at Cedar Lawn from Willow Brook Seventh-day Adventist Church near Boonsboro.

DeLauter's sisters and daughters said the day wasn't easy, but it was easier than Tuesday and had happy moments.

""Tuesday was a hard day because it was the first time we'd seen him,"" said Sharlene DeLauter, 74, Roy's oldest daughter and a Smithsburg-area resident.

Margaret Carr, 90, one of DeLauter's three sisters and only surviving siblings, said Friday was ""an easier day, knowing that he's going to be at rest.""

""It's the biggest blessing,"" said Evelyn Eccard, 93, the oldest of the six DeLauter children. Roy was second eldest.

Eccard said she was happy to know Roy was at rest in the cemetery, near the graves of their parents and younger brother, Dickie. Dickie was in the Navy and died in a car crash on his way back to Norfolk after a Mother's Day break, family members said.

Jane Kline, their sister, said she cried when she heard the bugler perform taps, reminding her of Dickie's death.

""It just gets to me,"" said Kline, 91, of the Smithsburg area.

But still, Kline said, ""It's a glorious day. … We have closure now. And I just wish my mother and father would have been here to see it.""

'Nothing short of a miracle'

After waiting 71 years for news of their brother and father, the family was notified in January that DeLauter's remains had been identified with the help of blood donated many years ago by Eccard and Carr.

Identifying DeLauter's remains involved scientists from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, according to an agency news release. Anthropological and isotope analysis, circumstantial evidence, and mitochondrial DNA and autosomal DNA analysis were used.

""To describe the return of Buddy, it would not be hyperbole to say it was nothing short of a miracle,"" said Ret. Gen. Kelly McKeague, director of the accounting agency. McKeague was among the dignitaries to speak at DeLauter's funeral at the church.

The DeLauter family called Roy ""Buddy"" because his father's name also was Roy.

When President Donald Trump met with North Korean leaders during a June 2018 summit, one of the commitments made was that North Korea would aid in the return and recovery of missing Americans in North Korea, McKeague said.

That July, North Korea turned over 55 boxes that purportedly contained the remains of American service members killed in the Korean War.

Scientists returned 80 of the 250 sets of remains in the boxes to South Korea after determining they were of South Korean origin, McKeague said. DeLauter's was one of the 170 left and one of 82 to be identified so far.

With DeLauter's burial on Friday, a bronze rosette will be placed by his name at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, signifying he's accounted for.

Honoring Sgt. Roy Charles DeLauter:Smithsburg soldier, missing in action in Korea, being memorialized

Reported missing in action

DeLauter was 21 years old when he was reported missing in action on Dec. 2, 1950.

He remained listed as missing in action until the end of the war, but his family didn't find out until last year the details of his death.

DeLauter's unit was on the east side of a North Korean reservoir on Nov. 27, 1950, ""when Chinese Communist Forces launched a large-scale surprise attack against U.S. forces at the reservoir,"" according to the accounting agency.

Four days later, on Dec. 1, the ""numerical superiority of the Chinese Communist Forces forced the 32nd Infantry Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division to withdraw south toward friendly lines at Hagaru-ri."" DeLauter was in Company D, 1st Battalion of the 32nd Infantry Regiment.

""Constant enemy fire and roadblocks made the withdrawal route extremely treacherous,"" according to the accounting agency.

DeLauter was reported missing in action after the withdrawal to Hagaru-ri.

Later, another soldier came forward to say he saw DeLauter get killed.

DeLauter was wounded in the right leg and either blown or thrown over a cliff in mountainous terrain, according to Sharlene DeLauter and military documents.

The DeLauters in Smithsburg received telegrams on back-to-back days in January 1950 that Roy Charles was missing in action and their middle son, Pfc. Boyd D. DeLauter, 17, had been injured in fighting in Korea on Dec. 11.

The soldier who witnessed Roy's death wasn't able to report it until 1953 because he was captured as a prisoner of war and wasn't freed until a prisoner exchange that year, Sharlene DeLauter has said. A corporal at the time of his death, DeLauter was posthumously promoted to sergeant.

DeLauter's name is etched in a local Korean War memorial in Hagerstown's North End and is listed on a war memorial in Smithsburg.

It also will be on the Korean War Wall of Remembrance to be dedicated this summer in Washington, D.C.

Northwest Florida rebuilds after every hurricane. But are we rebuilding in right places?

When the waves inevitably wash away a sandcastle, it only takes a few pails of sand and a light afternoon's work to rebuild. When hurricane winds, storm surge and flood waters inevitably come crashing down on the Gulf Coast — toppling beach homes, cracking asphalt and eroding the shoreline — it takes years of work and millions, sometimes billions, of dollars to rebuild. Still, communities stubbornly rebuild condos, beach homes, retail, resorts and even shorelines, knowing full well it could all come crumbling down again in the next big storm.

reagan@caglecartoons.com

On and on it goes. Another lone wacko, a white, 18-year-old, went on a well-planned killing spree in a supermarket in a black neighborhood of Buffalo. It was a terrible, tragic, evil, obviously racist act.

Ten innocent people died and three were injured last weekend — 11 victims were black.

We know the “alleged” killer was a white supremacist, an anti-Semite and a nut-job who clearly set out to kill black people because of what he posted online. Predictably, President Biden seized on the slaughter in Buffalo as further “proof” of his bogus claim that “the poison” of white supremacy poses the greatest threat to America today.

Also predictably, Biden and the usual liberal chorus of media outlets tried to link the country’s latest mass killing to Republicans, guns and Fox News stars like Tucker Carlson.

Biden went to Buffalo to show his sympathy for the victims, which is fine. But, as usual, he was very selective when pointing out recent examples of racially motivated mass murders. No mention of the angry “black supremacist” who plowed through a Christmas parade of white men, women and children in Waukesha, Wisc., last year, killing six and injuring 60.

No mention of the mentally troubled black man — another racist “black supremacist” who openly hated whites, Asians and even some blacks — who shot up a New York City subway train last month and injured 10 people. No mention of another apparently mentally troubled black man who’s accused of shooting but not killing three Korean women in a Dallas hair salon last week.

And you know the Bidens won’t be visiting the Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods in Southern California to show their sympathy for the deadly shooting that happened there earlier this week. The Asian shooter — an American citizen born in Taiwan — planned to kill many members of the congregation, who are Taiwanese, because he doesn’t think Taiwan should be independent of China.

Like the other shootings, that potential mass shooting, which was stopped when members of the church overpowered the shooter, did not fit the Biden-media narrative that the only kind of racism in America is white and that mass murderers come in only one color and one kind of politics.

The reaction to the Buffalo tragedy by Biden, the Democrats and the media was the usual “We need more, more, still more gun laws.” But how about enforcing the damned gun laws we’ve already got? How about putting some teeth into so-called “Red Flag” laws?

Though ripe for abuse by gun-control zealots, they allow law enforcement in states like New York to take weapons away from people who’ve been deemed threats to themselves or others.

The punk in Buffalo still legally had his guns even though he had made threatening remarks in high school last year about shooting up a graduation ceremony and had undergone a mental health evaluation and counseling.

And how about holding parents accountable for not taking their wacko sons’ guns away?

We count on the government to take guns away from dangerous or crazy people. But if you’re a parent and you have a whacked out son you’re worried about, lock up your damned guns. Get them out of the house. Don’t wait for government to take them away because the government is sure not going to take them.

Meanwhile, while Biden was in Buffalo exploiting that tragedy for his own political purposes, he also predictably forgot to mention the massacre of blacks that occurs every weekend in Chicago. Last weekend 33 people there were shot and five died. As usual, most were young black males shot by other young black males.

Of course we all know why the president will never have time to go to Chicago to grieve over its murder victims. He wouldn’t be able to blame its recurring weekly slaughter on white supremacy.",Q2

https://news.stlpublicradio.org/government-politics-issues/2022-06-09/missouri-poised-to-remove-unenforceable-discriminatory-housing-restrictions-in-deeds,Missouri poised to remove unenforceable discriminatory housing restrictions in deeds,"Realtor Shari Asher’s clients were in the process of listing their home in Monett in 2019 when they saw something in the deed that rattled them.

“When I sat down at their dinner table, I could tell they were both very embarrassed,” Asher said. “The wife slid a stack of papers across the table to me and said, ‘We need for you to read the deed restrictions.’”

Among the list of standard restrictions, there was a section in the deed that stated, “No persons of any race other than white shall own this property and are not allowed to use or occupy any structure on the property unless they were there in the capacity as domestic servants.”

Asher had heard about these “racially-restrictive covenants” written into deeds in the early part of the 20th century, and knew the language still existed in older homes. But in her more than 20 years as a realtor, she had never expected to see one in her small town in southwestern Missouri.

While it’s no longer legally enforceable, the discriminatory language is hurtful and offensive to potential buyers. She tried to get the language taken out at the title company and was told it was nearly impossible.

“My area has a large Hispanic population,” she said. “There are already trust issues that we often deal with in these real estate transactions, from language barriers to their personal history of dealing with governments and lending institutions that didn’t always keep their word and rules that seemed to change on a dime.”

Asher was among real estate agents who lobbied lawmakers this spring for a bill to require the removal of restrictions relating to a person’s race, color, religion or national origin from newly recorded deeds. The bill was approved by the legislature in May and sent to Missouri Gov. Mike Parson. He has not yet taken action on it.

A U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down states’ ability to enforce discriminatory covenants nationwide in 1948, and Missouri passed a law that echoed that decision in 1993. But Missouri legislators never set up a road map for how to take the language out of existing deeds, so they keep getting passed on from owner to owner.

St. Louis and Kansas City were among the cities that led the nation in restrictive covenants. According to a recent study, St. Louis still had 30,000 properties with restrictive covenants. Another 70,000 exist in St. Louis County.

Loading...

Missouri would join a handful of states that have recently enacted laws to remove such covenants from property records, following Maryland, California, Illinois, Connecticut and Virginia.

The enforcement of the bill falls on the recorder of deeds office in each Missouri county.

“We think this is a really important good-government cleanup to start getting some of these restrictive covenants – that are not enforceable anyway – but get them off the books,” said Jessica Petrie, a lobbyist for the Recorders’ Association of Missouri. “It’s already 2022.”

Important history

In 2019, Asher remembers her frustrating phone conversation with a title company about getting the passage removed.

“They’re like, ‘Well, you’d have to get everyone that lives in that area…and go before a judge,” Asher said. “She went on and on and on. At some point, I stopped listening because I’m like, no, that’s way too complicated.”

There was no easy remedy, she said, so the language stayed in the deed.

Under the legislation, the people who prepare or submit a deed for recording — typically a title company — would remove the language before sending it into the recorder of deeds. If the language is not removed, then the recorder of deeds office can refuse to accept the deed and send it back to the title company to make the changes.

For homeowners who aren’t intending on selling their home but would still like to remove the language from their deeds, Petrie said it would involve submitting a one-page document to the recorder’s office, which would cost $24. Most of that revenue would go to the county employer retirement fund and county general revenue, she said, but $5.50 of it would stay with the recorder’s office.

“It’s not so much about the $5.50,” Petrie said during a House committee meeting in February. “It’s about consistency across our documents.”

This is the second year the bill was introduced.

From Asher’s understanding, developers of the homes had to include the discriminatory language in the deeds in order to be eligible for federal construction loans.

After World War II, many working-class families — both white and black — were living in public housing projects. At some point, white families started to move out, and the projects became almost entirely black, said Richard Rothstein, author of The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America.

That’s because the Federal Housing Administration began to finance whites-only suburban housing divisions — which moved white working-class families out of the urban core and into the suburbs. The administration’s written manual required developers to sign agreements, or racial deed covenants, that they would not sell these homes to African Americans, he said.

Michael B. Thomas / Special to NPR The Shelley House, located in the Greater Ville neighborhood in north St. Louis set the backdrop for a landmark 1948 U.S. Supreme Court decision that made widespread racially restrictive covenants unenforceable.

On May 3, 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered its landmark decision in Shelley v. Kraemer, where the court ruled that state enforcement of racially restrictive covenants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. However, the case did not actually outlaw covenants, only a state’s enforcement of the practice.

The lawsuit centered around a Black homeowner, J.D. Shelley, in St. Louis, and the Shelley House is now a National Historical Landmark.

During the discussion on the House floor about the bill, Rep. Kevin Windham, D-Hillsdale, asked the bill sponsor Rep. Craig Fishel, R-Springfield if he thought it was important that the students throughout the state learn about this history.

“That at one point in time, we had restrictive covenants that would have stopped my grandparents from buying houses,” he said, “you think it’s important that young folks learn about their history?”

Fishel replied, “I think it’s very important.”",Q2

Dozens of Christie associates were in the room clutching their phones as they took orders from potential buyers. The auction house owned by French magnate Francois Pinault said in a brief press conference that the winning bid for the ""Marilyn"" was made from within the room.

Prior to the sale, the portrait was estimated to go for about $200 million, according to Christie's.

While falling just short of that threshold, it nevertheless beat the previous record for a 20th century work, Pablo Picasso's ""Women of Algiers,"" which brought $179.4 million in 2015.

The all-time record for any work of art from any period sold at auction is held by Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi,"" which sold in November, 2017 for $450.3 million.

Warhol's silk-screen work is part of a group of his portraits of Monroe that became known as the ""Shot"" series after a visitor to his Manhattan studio, known as ""The Factory,"" apparently fired a gun at them.

In a statement, Christie's described the 40-inch (100-centimeter) by 40-inch portrait as ""one of the rarest and most transcendent images in existence.""

Alex Rotter, head of 20th and 21st century art at Christie's, called the portrait ""the most significant 20th century painting to come to auction in a generation.""

""Andy Warhol's Marilyn is the absolute pinnacle of American Pop and the promise of the American Dream encapsulating optimism, fragility, celebrity and iconography all at once,"" he said in a statement.

Warhol began creating silkscreens of Monroe following the actress's death from a drug overdose aged just 36 in August 1962.

The pop artist produced five portraits of Monroe, all equal in size with different colored backgrounds, in 1964.

According to pop-art folklore, four of them gained notoriety after a female performance artist by the name of Dorothy Podber asked Warhol if she could shoot a stack of the portraits.

Warhol said yes, thinking she meant she would photograph the works. Instead, Podber took out a gun and fired a bullet through the forehead of Monroe's image.

The story goes that the bullet pierced four of the five canvasses, with Warhol barring Podber from The Factory and later repairing the paintings -- the ""Shot"" series.

The ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" portrait portrays her with a pink face, red lips, yellow hair and blue eye shadow set against a sage-blue backdrop.

It was based on a promotional photograph of her for the 1953 movie ""Niagara,"" directed by Henry Hathaway.

Charity

At an unveiling at Christie's headquarters, Rotter said the portrait stood alongside Sandro Botticelli's ""Birth of Venus"", Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" and Picasso's ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"" as ""categorically one of the greatest paintings of all time.""

Only 14 paintings have sold for more than $100 million at auction, according to an AFP tally, although others are expected to have changed hands for as much during private sales.

The auction record for a Warhol is the $104.5 million paid for ""Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)"" in 2013.

In 1998, Sotheby's sold the orange shot Marilyn for $17 million.

Other issues involve an internal affairs investigation of a member of the sheriff's command staff over his behavior at a meeting and staffing levels at the jail.

Tempers began to flare last week when the commissioners approved putting together an agreement that the county constables would manage the county's 911 emergency dispatchers. The commissioners had asked Sheriff Mike Gleason to manage the dispatchers but he said he only wanted to do it under an agreement he wrote.

His plan would include managing and training the 911 dispatchers who handle law enforcement calls but not the dispatchers who only handle fire and emergency medical calls. Gleason said it is a safety issue, as a dispatcher recently put out a call that a theft was taking place but it turned out to be an aggravated robbery.

""If someone comes in with a gun who's going to shoot you,"" he said, ""that's a very different call.""

The county currently has 52 emergency dispatchers who are managed by the county's emergency services department, which is not a law enforcement agency.

""Let me do this,"" Gleason said angrily at the Commissioners Court on May 31. ""I was elected to do this. The law said I'm supposed to do this.""

The Texas Department of Public Safety requires a law enforcement agency to manage non-law enforcement employees, including 911 dispatchers, who have access to criminal background information.

An audit done by the DPS in 2021 showed Williamson County was not complying with that requirement, said Michele Frei, the terminal agency coordinator for the sheriff's office. The county has been out of compliance since 2016, she said.

DPS officials did not respond to questions about the county not being in compliance, or whether it would approve the agreement the commissioners are working on with constables.

Gleason said after the May 31 meeting that he did not like the agreement the commissioners crafted for him because it involved dispatchers reporting to a committee involving non-law enforcement officials. He said that could give those officials the unfair ability to ask a dispatcher to check on someone's criminal record.

Commissioner Russ Boles defended the Commissioners Court, saying ""this is the way we've done it for 30 years.""

""We do have our own audit that says this is a great system we have and it works."" Boles said then.

Tensions flared again on Tuesday in the Commissioners Court over other issues with the sheriff's office.

Boles said that Sheriff's Chief Deputy Ken Evans called the county's human resources department last week to say he was hiring an attorney to sue the county and was going to use ""his connections with the Travis County sheriff"" to investigate Boles and Commissioner Cynthia Long.

Boles said a Williamson County sheriff's investigator then told him on June 1 that the sheriff's office had opened an internal investigation on Evans. Boles did not say what the investigation was about but added that Evans had not been placed on administrative leave.

""I'm not going be be bullied by threats of lawsuits or threats of investigation,"" said Boles. ""When I see this type or amount of mismanagement in the sheriff's office, I'm going to speak my mind.""

Evans said in a phone interview on Tuesday that he was under an internal affairs investigation at the sheriff's office because Long complained that Evans had behaved inappropriately at a homeland security task force meeting on May 10 for the Capital Area Council of Governments.

""I feel everything said about me was malicious and false,"" Evans said.

After the task force meeting, the members of its executive committee, including Long and Boles, voted him off the committee after Long told them that he was ""unable to serve,"" Evans said.

Evans said he called the county's human resources department last week and told them he was speaking with an attorney about possibly filing a whistleblower lawsuit against the county. ""I'm not going to sit back while the commissioner (Long) uses her authority to tarnish my career,"" he said.

He said he also had met with the Travis County sheriff's office about filing potential criminal charges against Long because she had him removed from the homeland task force committee.

""I believe she is misusing her office to do stuff like that,"" he said. Evans said he had mentioned pursuing complaints against Boles to the human resources department but decided against it.

Long issued a statement on Tuesday saying ""it is unfortunate that while in the ordinary course of conducting the County’s business allegations such as this arise.""

""Of course, Mr. Evans’ allegations against me are without merit,"" the statement said.

At Tuesday's Commissioners Court meeting, County Judge Bill Gravell said he was unhappy with the sheriff's office because there are 64 vacancies among jail staff.

READ: Williamson County gives starting corrections officers 17% pay hike, hires 3 prosecutors

""I am concerned about the safety of employees that are not being allowed vacation time or sick time or time off,"" said Gravell. ""There is such a significant turnover; these are number I've never seen before in our jail.""

Evans said that although the Commissioners Court gave corrections officers a raise last year, their pay is still among the lowest in the area. He said the county also doesn't offer any incentives for new hires, which it needs to do.

Jail employees currently can't take time off because the Texas Commission on Jail Standards requires there be one staff member working for every 48 inmates, he said.

https://cdispatch.com/opinions/2022-05-05/geoff-pender-whats-next-if-mississippi-abortion-ruling-overturns-roe/,Geoff Pender: What’s next if Mississippi abortion ruling overturns Roe?,"Legislative leaders in Mississippi’s long-running efforts to ban abortion were pleased by news the nation’s high court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, perturbed by the way the court’s decision was leaked, and looking ahead to banning abortion drugs or making other changes.

“I am thrilled by the news,” said Rep. Becky Currie, R-Brookhaven. “I hate how it has come out. I hesitate a little bit on celebrating until we see a full report from the court … But I think putting it back in the states’ hands for individual states to decide is what is best. I think it should have always been that way.”

Currie in 2018 authored House Bill 1510, a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, which is now before the nation’s high court in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. On Monday night, Politico reported it obtained a leaked draft U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion that would overturn the 49-year-old landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision and allow states to regulate — or ban — abortions.

Mississippi is one of 13 states that has a law on the books that would be triggered if Roe is overturned. That 2007 law would ban abortions in most cases in Mississippi. The state Legislature also passed another law — being blocked by a federal court — that would ban abortions at six weeks.

It would appear the decades-long push by conservative lawmakers in Mississippi is nearly won. But Currie and Sen. Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, another anti-abortion advocate, said there would likely still be work for the Republican supermajority state Legislature. Both said they would focus on banning abortion-inducing drugs.

“Depending on the outcome from the court, and if in fact abortions are outlawed in Mississippi, then the issue of chemical abortions, with drugs being overnighted from out of state, would certainly be fair game to address,” Fillingane said.

Currie said she “absolutely” would support a state ban on abortion drugs.

“You can go in at 10 weeks or earlier in a pregnancy and have a choice between the medication and the procedure, and I think that’s something that needs to be addressed,” said Currie, who is a registered nurse. “… I think that causes some big problems, when you give a woman a handful of medicine to go home and expel a child.”

Currie said she’s already seen reports about Congress attempting to codify the right to abortion that the Roe v. Wade decision had provided in federal law.

“That makes me very worried,” Currie said. “There are still hurdles in Washington, D.C. I perceive this being an issue that they would get rid of the filibuster over.”

Currie, Fillingane and others were angered at the unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion, saying it was likely from abortion rights supporters hoping to change the majority opinion of the high court.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves addressed this on social media.

“Everyone is rightly outraged over the alleged leak in the MS abortion case,” Reeves posted on Twitter. “Let’s think bigger. For decades, America has been uniquely radical in the West. Our abortion laws look like China & N. Korea. Please pray for wisdom and courage for (the U.S. Supreme Court). Countless lives can be saved!”

House Speaker Philip Gunn on Tuesday tweeted: “MS House Republicans led to protect the unborn with the passage of HB1510, now on review in Dobbs. Their efforts put us in a position to protect unborn lives. While I condemn the leak, I pray the Supreme Court will stand up for the sanctity of life and overturn Roe.”

Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann in a statement said: “Personally and religiously, I am pro-life. I am very hopeful Mississippi will prevail in this case. This important constitutional decision to restore our state’s rights, however, must not be tainted by unethical and criminal leaks. Any effort to use political pressure to thwart the judicial branch of our government is unacceptable and dangerous.”

But can he do anything?,"And it will once again raise the ugly question: what can authorities do about hate crimes, which experts predict may only get worse the closer we get to the US midterm elections in November? Indeed, an analysis this month by the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University indicated a double-digit spike in hate crimes last year, with incidents targeting Asian and Jewish Americans accounting for the bulk of the increase. Based on preliminary data from more than three dozen US police departments, the figures show that, on average, hate crimes in 37 major US cities rose by nearly 39 per cent - a trend that the study predicts is likely to worsen into 2022. Today’s attack is but the latest example. Gendron, who was arraigned on Saturday and pleaded not guilty for the shooting, lives about 320 kilometres from Buffalo.

We don’t understand why he targeted that particular Tops Friendly Market grocery store for his murderous plans, other than to say it is located in a predominantly black community. People hug outside the scene after a shooting at a supermarket on Saturday, May 14, 2022, in Buffalo, New York. Credit: AP His manifesto may also provide some clues, underlined by a familiar theme: that white Americans are at risk of being replaced by people of colour, the baseless and poisonous “great replacement theory” that Fox TV host Tucker Carlson regularly pushes on his show. Too many mass shootings in America have been triggered by the same ideology. Remember the tragedy in El Paso, Texas, in 2019, where 23 people were killed at a Walmart in what was the worst attack on Latinos in modern US history?

The shooter, who was white, drove more than 1000 kilometres to conduct the carnage, and later described his actions as a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.

Credit: El Paso Times Or what about the 2015 shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, where nine African Americans were killed during a Bible study? Loading That gunman, Dylann Roof, also had his own online manifesto filled with emblems associated with white supremacy.

Every time Americans are gunned down by some hate-fuelled stranger, there are “thoughts and prayers” and calls to do more - and today was no different. “The First Lady and I are praying for the victims and their families, and hearts all across this country are with the people of Buffalo,” Biden wrote in a statement released late at night. “We still need to learn more about the motivation for today’s shooting as law enforcement does its work, but we don’t need anything else to state a clear moral truth: A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation. Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America. Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern addressed parliament as new gun laws after the Christchurch massacre were passed in 2019. Credit: ninevms In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern could usher sweeping bans on semi-automatic weapons into law a month after the Christchurch massacre.

But as Biden’s Democrat predecessor Barack Obama learned, presidential power is not enough to tackle the gun lobby and the right to bear arms. Obama could sing Amazing Grace with the mourners, but he left office openly regretful he failed to pass federal gun control legislation. Perhaps the debate will pivot to stopping the spread of poisonous ideologies in social media’s outer reaches. In South Carolina in 2015, President Barack Obama sang Amazing Grace at the eulogy for Clementa Pinckney, who was murdered by a white supremacist. Credit: Getty Images New York Governor Kathy Hochul said of today’s attack: “It strikes us in our very heart to know there’s such evil that lurks out there.” “But mark my words - will be aggressive in our pursuit of anyone who subscribes to the ideals professed by other white supremacists and how there’s a feeding frenzy on social media platforms where hate festers more hate. That has to stop.”",Q2
https://gothamist.com/news/what-a-fight-for-abortion-rights-could-mean-for-hochul-and-new-york-democrats,What a fight for abortion rights could mean for Hochul and New York Democrats,"One by one, the responses from female Democrats came swiftly and forcefully to the leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. “I refuse to go backwards,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said during an unrelated press conference on Tuesday. Her statements of condemnation quickly turned into a rallying cry: A day later, Hochul rolled out two new campaign videos affirming her support for abortion rights. It was a vivid example of how, across the country, Democrats are attempting to capitalize on the threat to Roe as a way to energize and broaden political support, particularly among women voters. Although the fiercest midterm election battles are expected to be in red or swing states, in deep blue New York the issue will likely reframe debates in key races, which thus far have been dominated by concerns around public safety and the economy.

Some Democrats also hope the momentum will usher in legislative and funding initiatives that would strengthen access to abortions. A moderate with a massive campaign war chest, Hochul is heavily favored to win the Democratic primary and poised to become the state’s first woman elected governor. But she has come under increasing criticism, namely for an $850 million tax subsidy for a new Buffalo Bills stadium and a sloppy vetting process for the former Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin, who last month resigned amid a bribery scandal. The new campaign ads, one entitled “Strength” and the other “Always Protect,” time out to just 21 seconds combined and are part of an at least $10 million multimedia strategy targeting voters across the state. The first 15-second digital spot begins with a polaroid of the governor and her mother, who worked together on domestic violence issues. It ends with Hochul saying, “I’m protecting abortion access because I’ll always stand up for New York women.”

On Thursday, Hochul did a round of media hits where she offered a blunt take on the electoral impact of rolling back reproductive rights. “Abortion is on the ballot now,” she said during an appearance on MSNBC, pointing to the potential SCOTUS ruling as the fallout from Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices. “This is what happens when you don't elect Democrats.” Hochul also pledged to make New York a “safe harbor” for abortions, drawing a sharp contrast with the leading Republican gubernatorial challenger, Long Island Rep. Lee Zeldin, who opposes most abortions and last week embraced the idea of having a “pro-life” state health commissioner. Women’s rights advocates say that mobilizing voters around reproductive rights is a no-brainer, especially in New York. The state legalized abortion in 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade. A New York Times analysis of polls taken over the past decade found that 63% of residents believe abortion should be legal. “The reality is that this is not a polarizing issue,” said Heidi Sieck, who heads #VoteProChoice, a group which works to elect Democrats at the federal, state and local level who support abortion rights. Still, Sieck criticized Democrats for failing to recognize the threat to Roe and leaving the conversation about abortion to organizations like Planned Parenthood and NARAL, two leading advocacy groups. “We can’t have that anymore,” she said. Beyond the gubernatorial election, there are congressional races where the issue has already reinvigorated Democrats — in particular, the two candidates looking to unseat Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Donald Trump supporter who represents the 11th Congressional District, including Staten Island and South Brooklyn. Democrats Brittany Ramos DeBarros and former Rep. Max Rose are facing off in the district's primary. On Tuesday, Ramos DeBarros, a progressive, issued a series of tweets blasting the former president along with her primary opponent.

""I feel the fury that I think that a lot of people feel right now, that our elected officials have failed us for so long,"" Ramos DeBarros told Gothamist. ""Even when they've said that they ideologically agree, they failed to really step up and fight.” That same night she rallied with pro-abortion rights women outside the Staten Island courthouse and then joined a larger citywide protest in Foley Square in lower Manhattan. On Wednesday, Ramos DeBarros joined a rally outside the Brooklyn home of Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer demanding a vote to end the filibuster and enable a carve-out to codify abortion rights, a move that analysts say is unlikely to happen. As someone who describes herself as a working class “AfroLatina, Staten Islander, anti-war combat veteran,” Ramos DeBarros said this fight is about making sure race and class don’t determine who gets access to necessary health care, and it’s a fight she said she feels personally. Her opponent Rose has also seized the moment. On Wednesday, he and two state Legislature candidates — Jessica Scarcella-Spanton and Vinzent Argenziano — held an abortion rights rally in front of Malliotakis’ Staten Island office. He took a shot at Malliotakis who voted against the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would make abortion legal across the country. At the time, she called the bill “barbaric.” “You know what ‘barbaric’ is?” Rose said through a bullhorn. “Barbaric is a court telling millions upon millions of women that they know better than them.” In public statements, Malliotakis noted that the SCOTUS draft was not final and said she thought it was important for the court to investigate the source of the leak. On the issue of abortion rights, she said it was an issue for the courts, not politicians. If the issue is returned to the states, she reiterated her opposition to New York’s current law. Camille Rivera, a Democratic strategist, said that while women candidates need to be careful not to be “opportunistic,” the stakes demand that they lean into the moment.

There’s gotta be a reckoning and we need a thunderstorm of votes. And the only way to do that is by really honing in and meeting voters where they are and telling them that for women...

Camille Rivera, Democratic strategist

“There’s gotta be a reckoning and we need a thunderstorm of votes,” Rivera said. “And the only way to do that is by really honing in and meeting voters where they are and telling them that for women, particularly for women of color, it could be a life or death situation.” Rivera is representing Melanie D’Arrigo, a progressive candidate in one of the redrawn congressional districts that is currently held by Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat who is running for governor. Sieck, of #VoteProChoice, said there are still ways for New York to take the lead in abortion rights. “Even in a place as Democratic and pro-choice as New York, there are still things we have to do,” she said. In 2019, the New York City Council approved $250,000 to go toward a nonprofit called the New York Abortion Access Fund that pays for low-income women, including those outside the state, to receive the procedure. It even pays for women who require an abortion after 30 weeks to travel to a specialized clinic outside the city. Spearheaded by the Council’s Women’s Caucus, the effort made New York the first city in the country to directly fund abortions.

The ballooning of the American assistance to Kiev and involvement in the Ukraine conflict mark “the latest signs of what appears to be the Pentagon’s slow, steady march to deeper involvement in the European war,” the US-based Military.com news outlet reported Friday

According to the report, “the Pentagon has now moved to releasing itemized lists of the thousands of weapons, ammunition and hardware now being shipped to allies in Kiev.”

It has also announced a new Florida National Guard mission to train Ukrainians on the howitzers and radar systems in Germany, in a move to establish “a rotating pipeline of skilled troops to fight the Russians.”

The report further claimed that the use of US intelligence in the alleged sinking of Russian battleship Moskva by Ukrainian missiles and the loss of nearly a dozen Russian generals in the Ukraine conflict “was not publicly acknowledged by the Pentagon, despite reports by multiple news outlets.”

Yet, it was met with Pentagon’s acknowledgment that the US military is sharing vital battlefield intelligence with Ukraine.

""We try to provide them useful and relevant, timely intelligence so that they can better defend themselves,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby declared on Friday. ""But ultimately, they make the decision about what they're going to do with that information.""

Russia, however, has insisted that Moskva was not struck by a missile but sunk after an explosion within the warship.

The US military's involvement in the Ukraine war has ""absolutely"" increased since its outset, the report further emphasized, citing Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Washington-based think tank, The Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The next step in US involvement is likely to be the addition of military contractors inside Ukraine to maintain the influx of American weapons systems, which are flooding into Ukraine and may risk being sidelined without proper handling and care, Cancian also underlined.

He also pointed out that although US President Joe Biden has insisted that American troops will not enter Ukraine, the administration could find a workaround by funding Ukrainian maintenance contracts with foreign companies.

""All the equipment that we're giving to the Ukrainians is just too extensive to be absorbed in the short amount of time that we're giving them,"" Cancian further stressed. ""I think we're just asking too much, frankly, and I think what's going to happen is that, when that becomes apparent, we'll start using contractors in some way.""

In early March, defense officials avoided even confirming the first Stinger missiles were being sent to Ukraine amid concerns of escalating the conflict as Russian troops marched toward Kyiv, and defense analysts counted the days until Russian President Vladimir Putin would likely control the government of his next-door neighbor.

The changing US involvement in the Ukraine conflict is partly due to the changing nature of the war, which began on February 24, when Ukrainians were widely considered as underdogs, but after Russian forces failed in their attempt to conquer Kiev, the US and its Western allies became bolder in extending more military assistance to Ukraine.

The war, the report added, has now shifted to the eastern Donbas, a flat region where artillery will play a key role in the battle as it stretches into its third month, and Kiev’s requests for armor and larger weapons have been granted.

The US military has been authorized to ship nearly $4 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of the war, with the bulk of that coming over the past month.

Last month, Biden ordered the shipment to Ukraine of the first 18 of the M777 howitzers and 40,000 rounds. The announcement detailed 1,400 Stinger and 5,500 Javelin shoulder-fired missiles, as well as 22 other categories of weapons and battlefield supplies, including armored personnel carriers, helicopters, radars and drones.

Another 72 howitzers and 144,000 rounds, as well as vehicles to tow the cannons, were authorized by Biden on April 21 -- a massive increase from the first tranche, according to the report.

Biden is now calling on Congress to approve yet another $33 billion aid package for Ukraine, with $16 billion of that directed to the Pentagon.

The White House announced on Friday still another aid package of ""artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment"" for Kiev amounting to $100 million.

In addition to the massive uptick in weapons headed to Ukraine, the Pentagon further declared that US troops would start training the Ukrainians on the equipment. A Florida National Guard unit recently pulled from Ukraine in the lead-up to Russia's military operation in the country had never left the continent and is now heading up that mission, it announced last week.

The 160 Guard troops assigned to the 53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, known as Florida's ""Gator Brigade,"" are training the Ukrainians on the M777 howitzers and radar systems in Grafenwoehr, Germany, and other sites in Europe that the Pentagon did not unveil.

So far, the report added, the Guard has trained 150 Ukrainians on the howitzers. Another 15 have completed training on AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel air surveillance radar system, and 60 on the M113 armored personnel carriers, Kirby also announced on Friday, noting that yet another 50 are in training on the M113 now.",Q2

Community members, politicians and Phoenix police officers came together in the parking lot of the Sunnyslope Family Services Center, just across the street from where the shooting happened near 10th Avenue and Hatcher Road.

Officers responded to a strip mall near 10th Avenue and Hatcher Road around 1 a.m. where people were fleeing the area.

Emily Morgan,14, was pronounced dead after arriving at the hospital. Eight others were injured including two with life-threatening injuries.

The city of Phoenix's Neighborhood Services Department issued a notice of violation against an owner and a tenant of the strip mall for not possessing a necessary use permit for the gathering prior to the shooting.

Phoenix police said the shooting was the result of a fight at a ""party promoted on social media.""

ISLAMABAD, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will thwart any attempt to undermine its relations with China, Pakistani President Arif Alvi said here on Saturday, after a terrorist attack killed three Chinese nationals in Karachi earlier this week.

A shuttle passenger van of the Confucius Institute at the University of Karachi was attacked on Tuesday, which has left three Chinese teachers killed.

During his visit to the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, the president expressed condolences to the Chinese side over the deaths of the teachers, and strongly condemned the attack, saying that Pakistan will spare no effort to fight against terrorism and ensure the safety of Chinese citizens and institutions in the country.

The victims were friendly ambassadors who promoted people-to-people exchanges between Pakistan and China, he said, adding that the terrorists aimed at damaging the Pakistan-China friendship and the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Pakistan's development and the corridor construction cannot be achieved without the support of China, an ""iron brother"" of Pakistan, the president stressed.

Pang Chunxue, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, thanked Alvi for his visit, and said that China strongly condemns the terrorist attack and has asked the Pakistani side to investigate the incident and bring the perpetrators to justice.

China will join hands with Pakistan to ensure the safety of the Chinese citizens, projects and institutions in Pakistan, combat terrorism and promote regional peace and stability, she added. Enditem",Q2
https://www.city-journal.org:443/buffalo-and-stopping-mass-shooters-before-they-act,Buffalo and Stopping Mass Shooters Before They Act,"On Sunday, President Biden told a large assembly: “We must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America. . . . Our hearts are heavy once again, but the resolve must never, ever waver.”

He was responding, of course, to the mass shooting at the Tops Friendly Markets grocery store in Buffalo, New York, which left ten people dead and three injured.

The alleged shooter, 18-year-old Payton Gendron, drove several hours from his home in Conklin, New York, to a neighborhood and a market where shoppers were, in his estimation, most likely to be black. He was wearing tactical gear and armed with the Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle he had bought legally in Endicott, New York, with the intention—reportedly detailed in his racist manifesto—to use it to shoot blacks.

Hate is not, as Biden labels it, an abstract stain on the soul of America. It is an idea that festers in the minds of violent people. It is our duty to get better at identifying and stopping these individuals before they hurt others.

And we can get better at identifying and stopping them.

Gendron had been actively ranting online about his hatred for blacks. He took inspiration from racist conspiracy theories on online message boards and explicitly identified himself as a fascist, white supremacist, racist, and anti-Semite. On the Internet, he had detailed plans to carry out a shooting targeting blacks similar to the one he wound up perpetrating in Buffalo.

Similarly, Frank James, the black man who traveled to New York from Philadelphia last month to shoot up ten passengers on a rush hour subway, had been raging online for a decade about blacks, whites, Latinos, and Jews. He also fumed against New York mayor Eric Adams and the city’s subway system and alluded to leaving Philadelphia to take action. And Robert Gregory Bowers had written colorfully about his intention to attack Jews (and his murderous hatred for blacks) before driving to Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018 and massacring 11 worshippers.

We should be devoting more resources both to intelligence-gathering about action-oriented violent rhetoric online and to the manpower needed to follow up on all such threats. These types of investigations, occurring in both federal and local agencies, are resource- and training-intensive.

Violently manifested hate is definitely growing. Anti-Semitic incidents broke records in 2021, and anti-Asian hate crimes have broken records for the past two years. In New York City, the country’s epicenter for hate crimes (thanks, in part, to its demographic diversity), crimes against blacks and gay men have doubled since last year. Who perpetrates these crimes? Whites, blacks, Latinos—it’s a sickness that crosses all racial and ethnic boundaries.

One commonality among attackers is a high degree of mental illness. As announced this month at a New York City Council hearing, police designated nearly half of all hate-crime arrestees as emotionally disturbed. The NYPD admitted that it wasn’t doing enough to track whether these suspects receive treatment or to coordinate with mental-health professionals.

High-risk mental illness was a known issue for Gendron, whom state police brought to a hospital last June after he wrote in high school about wanting to shoot people. The hospital released him a day and a half later. This story is tragically familiar. In 2017, Martial Simon reportedly “told a psychiatrist at the state-run Manhattan Psychiatric Center that it was just a matter of time before he pushed a woman to the train tracks.” This past January, he pushed Deloitte executive Michelle Go to her death from a Times Square subway platform.

In addition to these gaps in psychiatric oversight for individuals who have voiced an intention of committing violence, states including New York have reduced in-patient psychiatric beds dramatically. Sweeping criminal-justice reforms have hampered judges’ ability to induce unbalanced offenders into psychiatric care as a means of avoiding jail time.

Policymakers at all levels need to prioritize closing these gaps between police, prosecutors, and psychiatric practitioners and ensuring that sufficient spaces are available for the small but critical segment of the population that requires long-term supervision. As the president said, our hearts are heavy. Now let’s use our heads.

https://www.wtkr.com/news/thousands-of-virginia-students-voice-support-for-abortion-rights,Thousands of Virginia students voice support for abortion rights,"RICHMOND, Va. -- Thousands of Virginia students joined a nationwide movement to walk out of class Monday and voice their support for abortion rights. In the week since a leaked draft opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court that would overturn the constitutional right to abortion became public, advocacy groups across the issue have been in high gear.

The student-led Generation Ratify helped organize the walkouts in Virginia. They were planned at 45 schools across the Commonwealth, the organization said.

In Henrico County, school leaders said 1,145 students took part at six schools. At Richmond’s Open High School, more than 100 of the 200 students at the school walked into the parking lot to rally and speak on the importance of abortion rights.

“Speak up that we do not stand for this, that we do not want this,” student Drew Benedetti, an organizer of the rally, said of the leaked opinion’s potential outcome.

Legal experts said if Roe vs. Wade is overturned as the draft opinion states, the legality of abortion would be an issue for individual states.

“I’m so proud. I’m honestly just floored,” said Felix Hedberg, who helped organize the walkouts across Virginia. “I found out the day before I had to take an exam that the draft leaked, and I was scared. I was scared for my sister, for my family, for me, and for all my peers. We’re scared, but we’re going to work passed that fear. We’re going to work to make sure Virginia codifies Roe v. Wade.”

Although abortion would remain legal in Virginia, Hedberg and others at the Open High rally said they fear this signals a beginning of an effort to roll back reproductive rights.

“They can minimize an issue by making it political and by not telling the stories of people. So, we’re trying to break with that narrative,” she said. “Needing access to birth control, people who have had abortions before, people who have been sexually assaulted. It was just really beautiful to see people advocate for each other.”

Given the gravity of the potential SCOTUS ruling, advocacy is cutting both ways on the issue.

Hannah Wolfe works for Students for Life of America, working with students on dozens of Virginia university campuses to talk about resources available other than abortion. Wolfe said their work has stepped up in the days since the leaked document came to light.

“Letting people know what our plan is in a post-Roe America,” Wolfe said. “Everybody knows who Planned Parenthood is, but not everybody knows the pregnancy help center that’s literally five minutes away from them, sometimes within walking distance from them, they don’t realize how much is available to them for free from these places.”

Wolfe believes life begins at conception but is very much aware others strongly disagree on the topic, especially in this charged moment.

“There’s this idea that being pro-life is anti-woman, and that’s not the case at all. We believe that being pro-life is being pro-woman. Like I said, I want to open that conversation; I want to invite people in. I want to hear what they think, and I want to share what I think,” Wolfe said.

As for the school’s role in walk-outs during school hours, CBS 6 requested information from the four largest school districts in Central Virginia. Spokespersons from both Henrico and Chesterfield provided statements.

“Some students chose to participate in a walkout in regard to recent Supreme Court news. This was not a school-sponsored event. However, school staff worked throughout this time to ensure students were safe. It is important to note that anytime a student leaves campus without permission or does not return to their classroom when redirected, their behavior is managed per the Code of Student Conduct,” wrote Chesterfield Schools Spokesman Shawn Smith.

Henrico County School officials sent the following message to school staff and families Monday:

“Students across the nation – including some in Henrico County Schools – have indicated that they plan to walk out of class today to make their voices heard on the Supreme Court discussion of Roe v. Wade.

While the school division continues to be supportive of students and their right to demonstrate peacefully, we will neither condone nor support the act of leaving school grounds without permission during the instructional day. We expect students will attend classes for the full day.

Students who need to leave school grounds during the instructional day must provide a written note signed by a parent or guardian in order to receive an excused absence. Students who leave school grounds without permission may face a consequence in accordance with the Code of Student Conduct.

School Board policy precludes employees from engaging in any activity supporting or opposing a partisan political cause while on duty, while on school property during school hours, or while representing the school division. Our staff remain committed to monitoring students in class and on campus grounds to ensure a safe and orderly school environment.

If you have specific questions or concerns about your student, a school administrator will be happy to speak with you.”

A final opinion on Roe vs. Wade from the Supreme Court is expected in either June or July, according to Chief Justice John Roberts.",Q2

After lawyers for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard both presented arguments concerning the countersuit, Judge Penney Azcarate noted at the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse in Virginia that it is not her responsibility to judge the truth or weight of the evidence.

Johnny Depp's Motion To Strike Amber Heard's Counterclaim Denied

Although Johnny Depp is not mentioned in the article, Heard has previously accused the actor of assaulting her, which he denies. Amber Heard filed a $100 million counterclaim in response to Depp's lawyer Adam Waldman's claims that the actress' abuse allegations were fiction. Rottenborn's argument came after Depp attorney Benjamin Chew filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on Tuesday.

Last month, Johnny Depp testified for four days, insisting he never hit Heard and accusing her of frequently getting physically violent with him. He claimed to have had his middle finger amputated after Heard hurled a bottle at him in Australia in 2015.

Amber Heard finished her four-day testimony last Thursday, claiming she never mistreated Depp and that the actor damaged his finger by shattering a phone. She detailed other events in which Depp allegedly mistreated her, including accusing him of sexually assaulting her with a bottle in Australia.

Her lawyers rested their case on Tuesday without asking Johnny Depp to testify. The trial's closing arguments are scheduled on Friday, The Star reported.

The Truth in Amber Heard's Aquaman Role

Meanwhile, a Warner Bros official testified that Amber Heard's position as Mera in Aquaman 2 was unaffected by the claims leveled against her by ex-husband Johnny Depp. 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' actor's side launched their counter case with a video deposition from Walter Hamada, who is in charge of DC-based films. In his deposition, Hamada revealed that Heard had an option deal with Warner Bros to portray Mera in the Aquaman franchise.

He also stated that there has been a delay in casting owing to continuing conversations about recasting the character of Mera due to chemistry difficulties between Aquaman's Jason Momoa and Heard.

Hamada's testimony comes a day after Heard's representative testified that Momoa was keen about reprising her part in the upcoming sequel. Heard previously testified that her involvement in Aquaman 2 was drastically reduced due to her legal dispute with Depp. Meanwhile, a petition demanding her removal from the Aquaman sequel has over 4.5 million signatures.

Johnny Depp's Ex-Girlfriend Kate Moss To Testify in Trial

Furthermore, British supermodel Kate Moss will testify on behalf of Johnny Depp in his defamation trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard on Wednesday. Kate Moss, 48, will testify via video connection about an event that occurred when she was walking down some steps in Jamaica. She was wearing flip-flops and slipped on the last two stairs. Johnny caught her and cared for her, a source told the New York Post.

After Amber Heard, 36, told jurors about a dispute with Depp, 58, near a staircase in the couple's Los Angeles apartment in March 2015, the cat walker was dragged into the complex court battle. Amber Heard said that she and Depp were arguing over the actor's alleged adultery when she saw him ready to push her sister, Whitney Henriquez Heard, down a flight of stairs. Heard said she punched Depp for the first time, and it was her first punch.

As JohnnyDepp smirked, his attorney, Ben Chew, turned to his staff and did a fist pump. The mention of Moss allowed Depp's team to call the model as a witness to dispute the claim. Moss, who dated Depp from 1994 to 1997, is anticipated to testify that the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' star was never aggressive towards her, according to Independent.

New York Times A barbecue in a parking lot at JFK8, Amazon’s warehouse on Staten Island, on May 13, 2021, part of a unionization drive by Chris Smalls, left, and Derrick Palmer.

New York Times Christian Smalls, president of the Amazon Labor Union, right, celebrates with other members outside of the National Labor Review Board’s offices in Brooklyn, on Friday, April 1, 2022.

In the first dark days of the pandemic, as an Amazon worker named Christian Smalls planned a small, panicked walkout over safety conditions at the retailer’s only fulfillment center in New York City, the company quietly mobilized.Amazon formed a reaction team involving 10 departments, including its Global Intelligence Program, a security group staffed by many military veterans. The company named an “incident commander"" and relied on a “Protest Response Playbook"" and “Labor Activity Playbook"" to ward off “business disruptions,"" according to newly released court documents.In the end, there were more executives — including 11 vice presidents — who were alerted about the protest than workers who attended it. Amazon’s chief counsel, describing Smalls as “not smart, or articulate,"" in an email mistakenly sent to more than 1,000 people, recommended making him “the face"" of efforts to organize workers. The company fired Smalls, saying he had violated quarantine rules by attending the walkout.In dismissing and smearing him, the company relied on the hardball tactics that had driven its dominance of the market. But Friday, he won the first successful unionization effort at any Amazon warehouse in the United States, one of the most significant labor victories in a generation. The company’s response to his tiny initial protest may haunt it for years to come.Smalls and his best friend from the warehouse, Derrick Palmer , had set their sights on unionizing after he was forced out. Along with a growing band of colleagues — and no affiliation with a national labor organization — the two men spent the past 11 months going up against Amazon, whose 1.1 million workers in the United States make it the country’s second-largest private employer.At the bus stop outside the warehouse, a site on Staten Island known as JFK8, they built bonfires to warm colleagues waiting before dawn to go home. They made TikTok videos to reach workers across the city. Palmer brought homemade baked ziti to the site; others toted empanadas and West African rice dishes to appeal to immigrant workers. They set up signs saying “Free Weed and Food.""The union spent $120,000 overall, raised through GoFundMe , according to Smalls. “We started this with nothing, with two tables, two chairs and a tent,"" he recalled. Amazon spent more than $4.3 million just on anti-union consultants nationwide last year, according to federal filings.The unionization vote reflects an era of rising worker power. In recent months, a string of Starbucks stores have voted to organize as well. But JFK8, with 8,000 workers, is one of Amazon’s signature warehouses, its most important pipeline to its most important market.Amazon has fought unionization for years, considering it a dire threat to its business model. Its ability to speed packages to consumers is built on a vast chain of manual labor that is monitored down to the second. No one knows what will happen if the newly organized workers try to change that model or disrupt operations — or if their union is replicated among the more than 1,000 Amazon fulfillment centers and other facilities across the country.For all their David-versus-Goliath disadvantages, the Staten Island organizers had the cultural moment on their side. They were buoyed by a tightened labor market, a reckoning over what employers owe their workers and a National Labor Relations Board emboldened under President Joe Biden , which made a key decision in their favor. The homegrown, low-budget push by their independent Amazon Labor Union outperformed traditional labor organizers who failed at unionizing Amazon from the outside, most recently in Bessemer, Alabama.“I think it’s going to shake up the labor movement and flip the orthodoxy on its head,"" said Justine Medina, a box packer and union organizer at JFK8 who had waited with an exuberant crowd in Brooklyn to hear the vote results.The future of American unionizing efforts “can’t be about people coming in from the outside with an organizing plan that people have to follow,"" Sara Nelson, head of the flight attendants union, said in an interview. “It has to come from within the workplace.""Now, both the nascent JFK8 union and Amazon face pressing questions. The union, with no traditional infrastructure, experience or leadership, is likely to face a legal battle over the vote and challenging contract negotiations. The company, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article, will have to decide whether to reconsider some of its tactics and address the underlying labor dissatisfaction that handed it such a sweeping defeat.“Amazon wanted to make me the face of the whole unionizing efforts against them,"" Smalls wrote in a tweet Friday, appearing undaunted by the task ahead. “Welp there you go!""When the first coronavirus cases were confirmed at JFK8 in March 2020, Palmer and Smalls confronted managers with safety concerns. Employees were increasingly worried about rising infection rates and felt that Amazon was not notifying them about cases in a timely manner, managers documented in newly released court records.But Amazon refused to pause operations, saying it had taken “extreme measures„ to keep workers safe. The pandemic had turned JFK8 into a lifeline for the city, where 24/7 shifts and a fleet of trucks delivered supplies as it went into lockdown.As Amazon moved to fire Smalls that March, two human resource employees at JFK8 doubted the wisdom of his dismissal. “Come on,„ one messaged. Smalls was outside, peaceful and social-distancing, she wrote. His firing, she predicted, would be “perceived as retaliation.„ But the termination proceeded.After the firing, the chief counsel’s smear against Smalls — a full apology came later — and the dismissal of another protester, the two friends resolved to take action. Smalls was outspoken, Palmer deliberate. They were both Black men from New Jersey and the same age (31 then, 33 now). Both had dropped out of community college, prided themselves on high scores on Amazon’s performance metrics and once hoped to rise within the company.Now they made new plans. Palmer would keep working at JFK8, the better to change it from inside.In early 2021, they took a road trip to another Amazon warehouse. When workers held a union drive in Bessemer, Alabama, Palmer and Smalls wanted to witness it. But they found organizers from the retail union — the one that had previously declared an interest in JFK8 — less than welcoming to them and thought the professionals seemed like outsiders who had descended on the community.By April, workers in Bessemer had rejected the union by more than a 2-1 margin. Palmer and Smalls declared their intention to organize JFK8, but few took them seriously. Why should they win when better-funded, more experienced operatives had been beaten?As they set about their first task — gathering thousands of worker signatures to trigger a unionization vote — cracks in Amazon’s employment model were plainly evident.As Palmer and Smalls approached workers at the bus stop, Amazon’s tone toward its employees kept shifting. Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, was handing over the role of CEO to Andy Jassy, and the company raised wages and added the goal of being “Earth’s best employer„ to its guiding principles. It pledged to listen to complaints and improve working conditions.At other times, it was contentious. In a widely publicized Twitter exchange about the Bessemer organizing, Amazon sounded so dismissive about workers who could not take bathroom breaks and had to urinate in bottles that it had to apologize.That fall, after months of gathering support, the New York union organizers delivered more than 2,000 signatures to the labor board, but they were rejected for not meeting the minimum required to hold an election. Smalls said Amazon had submitted payroll data to the board indicating that the company believed half the people who had signed cards no longer worked at the warehouse.“After all those months of hard work, it seemed like the momentum was gone,"" Palmer recalled in an interview. Between working his shifts and organizing at JFK8 on his time off, he had spent barely a day away from the warehouse for months. Some of the employees he approached were skeptical of unions or dues, or just grateful for Amazon’s health care and pay, which starts above $18 an hour at JFK8. Others seemed too exhausted and wary to even engage.To press onward, the union leaders posted the TikTok videos, made outdoor s’mores and sang along to hip-hop and Marvin Gaye. When workers faced family crises, the budding union prayed. One fired employee became homeless, and the group set up a fundraising campaign.Their near-constant presence at the warehouse helped. “The more comfortable they get with us, that’s when they start opening up to us,„ Palmer said of other workers.Some union sympathizers took jobs at JFK8 specifically to help the organizing effort, according to Medina, who was among them.Amazon countered with the full force of its anti-union apparatus. It monitored organizers’ social media, court filings show, pelted workers with text messages and blanketed the warehouse with signs saying “Vote NO„ or claiming the union leaders were outsiders. The company often held more than 20 mandatory meetings with workers a day, the Times reported last month, in which managers and consultants cast doubt on the effort.The organizers at JFK8 fought back, filing dozens of complaints with the NLRB claiming that Amazon violated workers’ rights to organize. Amazon has denied their allegations, but the labor board found many to be credible and pursued them in administrative court.By Christmas, the organizers scored a major legal win. Amazon agreed to a nationwide settlement, among the largest in the agency’s history, that said workers could stay in the buildings to organize when they were off the clock.In the weeks before the count, Amazon, which has consistently said its workers are best served by a direct relationship with the company, laid the groundwork for potential challenges to the election — arguing in legal filings that the labor board had abandoned “the neutrality of their office„ in favor of the union.On Friday morning inside the agency’s offices in Brooklyn, Smalls, in siren-red streetwear, sat next to Amazon’s lawyer to review each ballot. His knee jittered as each vote was presented.The votes were tallied — 2,654 for the union, 2,131 against. With a comfortable margin secured, Palmer, Smalls and other representatives emerged into the spring light, screamed with joy and clasped one another in a tight circle.A few miles away, at JFK8, workers were stealthily monitoring the results in between packing and stowing boxes. There was no formal announcement. Instead, a shout rose up from somewhere on the floor: “We did it! We won!""",Q2
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/05/03/pers-m03.html,Pelosi pledges war “until victory is won”,"Over the weekend, Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives and second in the line of presidential succession, traveled in secret to the war zone of Kiev, Ukraine and pledged a commitment by the United States to ensure “victory” against Russia.

Repeating the false premise that the United States’ involvement in the war with Russia is about helping Ukraine, an embattled ally, Pelosi told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “Our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done.” She added, “We stand with Ukraine until victory is won.”

Democratic Representative Jason Crow, who accompanied Pelosi on her trip to Ukraine, was even more emphatic in asserting that the United States is a party to the war, declaring at a press conference in Poland, “The United States of America is in this to win, and we will stand with Ukraine until victory is won.”

Pelosi’s pledge, coming just one week after similar assurances by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, amounts to an unlimited commitment of treasure and blood to the pursuit of sweeping, open-ended war aims that threaten to draw the United States into what Biden called “world war.”

What does “victory” in Ukraine mean? In the span of just one week, Biden, Austin and leading members of the president’s political party have all given conflicting and irreconcilable answers as to what the United States is trying to achieve in Eastern Europe.

On one hand, Biden claimed that it is “not true” that the United States is engaged in a proxy war with Russia. On the other, Austin said at a press conference in Poland last week that the United States is seeking to “weaken” Russia. The New York Times has raised the prospect of “bringing Russia to its knees,” while former US Army Europe Commander Ben Hodges called for “breaking the back” of Russia.

To which of these goals is Pelosi committing the United States?

If one accepts Pelosi’s statements in the most limited and most literal sense, they mean that the United States will assist Ukraine in achieving its military aims in regard to Russia. But Ukraine’s own military goals, developed in close cooperation with US military planners, are sweeping.

On March 24, 2021, Zelensky signed a document pledging to “implement measures to ensure the de-occupation and reintegration of the [Crimean] peninsula.” This means that Ukraine is formally committed to the seizure of Crimea, territory that Russia claims as its own, through military means.

If Ukraine succeeds in breaking the Russian offensive in the Donbas, routs the attacking Russian forces, and pushes into Russian territory, would the United States be “committed” to support Ukraine in this “fight”?

In another scenario, what will the United States do if Russian forces continue their advance toward Western Ukraine, encircling pockets of the Ukrainian army and leading to its disintegration? What does Pelosi’s open-ended commitment to “victory” against Russia mean if Ukraine is threatened with strategic defeat?

Pelosi’s statement makes clear that, forced to choose between the prospect of reneging on its “commitment” and the deployment of troops—or even the use of nuclear weapons—the United States will choose the latter.

Last week, Democratic Senator Chris Coons called for a “conversation” about sending US troops to fight against Russia in Ukraine.

Asked about Coons’s statements, Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016, merely called the measure “premature”—effectively an admission that plans are already in the works. On Sunday, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger announced that he has introduced an Authorization for Use of Military Force that would allow Biden to deploy US troops in a full-scale war with Russia.

In the course of the Vietnam War, the United States was drawn into an ever more bloody and brutal war that followed the logic of the military commitments it had made.

The Pentagon Papers, first published in 1971, revealed that in the early 1960s, under President John F. Kennedy, American imperialism transformed its involvement in Vietnam, which had up to that point been called a “limited-risk gamble” into a “broad commitment.”

One of the most damning components of the Pentagon Papers was an internal Defense Department memo, drafted in 1965, that concluded that the main reason for US involvement was to uphold the United States’ “commitment,” the breach of which would lead to a “humiliating U.S. defeat.” The United States’ goals were ranked as follows:

70% – To avoid a humiliating U.S. defeat (to our reputation as a guarantor).

20% – To keep [South Vietnam] (and the adjacent) territory from Chinese hands.

10% – To permit the people [of South Vietnam] to enjoy a better, freer way of life.

NOT – To help a friend

In pursuit of enforcing the global position of the United States in the post-war period, 58,220 American soldiers lost their lives, hundreds of thousands were physically and psychologically destroyed, and over 1 million Vietnamese men, women and children were killed.

The Pentagon Papers revealed the extent to which American foreign policy is made in secret. The public is presented with a set of facts and arguments that bear no relationship to the actual goals that are propelling the conflict. The aim of media discussion is not to allow the people to democratically control the conduct of foreign policy, but to condition public opinion to accept the outcome desired by the American state apparatus.

The stakes in the present war are vastly higher than they were in Vietnam. From its origins as a US proxy war aiming to “bleed Russia white,” the conflict over Ukraine is rapidly spiraling into a full-scale war between two nuclear-armed states.

Within the entire US political establishment, there is no serious attempt to explain what the war is about. There simply exists no opposition to a reckless and insane policy that threatens to end human civilization through the eruption of a nuclear third world war.

The real aims of US imperialism in the war against Russia were spelled out by WSWS International Editorial Board Chairman David North in his opening report to the May Day 2022 Online Rally, “The NATO-Russia war and the tasks of the international working class”:

Russia has become a target of US imperialism not because of the Putin regime’s autocratic character, but because, first, its defense of the interests of the Russian capitalists collides with the drive of the United States for global hegemony, which is centered on its preparations for war with China; and, second, the vast expanse of Russian territory is the source of immensely valuable and strategically critical raw materials, metals and minerals—gold, platinum, palladium, zinc, bauxite, nickel, mercury, manganese, chromium, uranium, iron ore, cobalt and iridium, to name only a few—that the United States is determined to bring under its control.

US officials are admitting with increasing candor that American imperialism wants to “break the back” of Russia and “bring Russia to its knees.” In pledging to wage war to complete “victory,” the United States is creating the conditions for catastrophe.

The social force that must be mobilized to stop the mad drive to world war is the working class. As North concluded his report, “The international working class must declare war on imperialist war.”

The May Day Rally, addressed by representatives of the International Committee of the Fourth International throughout the world, detailed the international socialist perspective upon which this struggle must be waged.",Q2

Howard University News Service

Patricia Ceasar received a reverse 911 call from the city of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on a Monday evening that warned residents of an unspecified danger in close proximity and told them to evacuate.

“It was very nerve wracking,” said Ceasar, a Winston-Salem resident for over 30 years. “I have never in my whole life been evacuated and I was so shocked at the reverse 911 call that I called the police department to see if it was some kind of hoax … and they told me it was not a hoax and that I needed to leave.”

It turned out that nearly 600 tons of ammonium nitrate had caught fire at the Winston Weaver fertilizer plant on Jan. 31. The fire burned for four days straight, with firefighters being unable to approach and contain the fire, due to the risk of a deadly explosion with the potential to kill thousands. Instead, residents within a mile radius were told to evacuate, temporarily displacing a reported 6,000 people.

Ceasar, along with other nearby residents, fled in fear of their safety and once safe had that same fear for their homes and belongings they had left behind.

“If I had lost my home, I wouldn’t have had anything but the car I was driving,” Ceasar said. “How in the world would I start over?”

Ammonium nitrate, which can cause respiratory problems, is a chemical used to make fertilizers and explosives. The chemical can burn if in contact with combustible material and can also produce toxic oxides of nitrogen. In 2013, a fertilizer plant in the town of West, Texas, reportedly containing as much as 270 tons of ammonium nitrate, exploded after a fire broke out, killing 15 people and injuring 200 more.

Although the fire that ravaged the Winston-Salem plant has since been contained, with residents given permission to return to their homes, three lawsuits have been filed against the company for negligence, as well as the potential health concerns with the release of dangerous chemicals into the air and local waterways.

Soon after the fire ended, officials reportedly warned residents to stay away from local creeks due to chemical detection and released the following statement: “City officials are warning the public to stay out of Muddy, Mill and Monarcas creeks downstream from the Winston Weaver Co. fertilizer plant and to keep pets and other animals out of the creeks due to elevated levels of chemicals in the water resulting from the fire at the plant.”

Minor Barnette, director of Forsyth County Environmental Assistance and Protection, told Fox 8 that the air quality near the plant had improved greatly since the beginning of fire, but there has been little update on the status of local water supplies since the initial one.

Though the air quality has been deemed “breathable” and residents have returned home, the fire at the Winston Weaver has still left lasting, negative impacts on a community forced to pack up and leave at a moment’s notice, confused as to how they could live so close to a plant holding a significant amount of dangerous chemicals, without ever being notified.

Although Patricia Ceasar shared that she was familiar with the plant’s existence and drove past it often, she admitted that she, like others, were unaware of the plant’s contents. “All of us were wanting to know why was this amount of stuff up there, and nobody had any idea,” Ceasar said. “We were just clueless.”

The chances of a fertilizer plant catching on fire and exploding are liable to happen anywhere in the nation and as such, affect any community who lives close by. However, African Americans are 75% more likely to live in “fence-line communities” (communities next to a company, service or industrial facility that have a direct effect on the community) and more likely (along with other people of color or POC) to be exposed to air pollution. As such, they are more likely to suffer from asthma, cancer and other chronic illnesses than other races.

According to the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) mapping system, all areas bordering the plant are of a high minority and low-income population, with the area to the east consisting of 95% minorities.

And this is not a coincidence, but by design, as is the case with many communities of color disproportionately located near industrial areas.

In 1904, a water reservoir cracked, and 800,000 gallons of water poured into the street, killing nine people and destroying eight houses. The area of destruction, nicknamed “The Pond,” attracted African Americans after its rebuild as it was one of the few places they could find a place to live.

In June 1912, Winston-Salem’s Board of Aldermen enacted an ordinance that prevented Black people from owning or living on property in certain areas near white people.

The topography of The Pond created stagnant rainwater, which became home to industrial runoff from nearby factories. Through various practices enacted by city officials, Black people were unable to move out of their neighborhood or improve upon it, and The Pond became one of the worst neighborhoods within the city.

Although the 1912 ordinance was later ruled unauthorized and The Pond eventually underwent a “slum clearance project,” Winston-Salem continued to enact laws to divide the city by race and discourage white communities from allowing African Americans inside them.

This included the creation of a highway known as U.S. 52, which not only cut into the Black community located east of the highway, but also segregated Black residents from the white community on the west. The Weaver fertilizer plant sits about a mile west of the highway, and a majority of the residents around the plant are reportedly low-income people of color.

At the time of the plant’s creation in 1939, it was located outside of city limits. However, when houses began to be built in the area, African Americans were more likely to be able to afford the area near the plant than others neighborhoods, because of these geographical racist practices.

A Legacy of Environmental Racism

Winston-Salem is not the only North Carolina city guilty of geographical and environmental racism and injustice. In Eastern North Carolina where the majority of industrial animal farms reside, communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted complain of contaminated water from hog waste and rancid smells from decomposing animals and rotten eggs.

“There’s also a physical geography that often influences a lot of environmental injustice,” shared

Russell Smith, a geography professor at Winston-Salem State University and faculty lead for the Spatial Justice Studio at the Center for Design Innovation.

“For most of North Carolina, the western side of cities are a higher elevation and the eastern sides are lower,” Smith explained. “So, wastewater treatment plans are going to be in those lower lying areas.”

“The other physical geography piece that goes along with that is predominant wind patterns,” Smith added. “The wind tends to flow from the southwest to the northeast, and because of that polluting industries tend to be placed on the east side: one, so that they could collect sewer runoff and two, for smokestacks.”

A study from the North Carolina Medical Journal found that communities located near concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) have higher rates of “infant mortality, mortality due to anemia, kidney disease, tuberculosis, septicemia and higher hospital admissions/ED visits of LBW (low birthweight) infants.”

North Carolina is one of the top poultry producing states in the country, and poultry operations in the state that use dry waste systems are not required to have permits.

And to the northeast in Warren County, North Carolina, the state government decided that a poor, rural Black community would be the site for toxic waste dumping in 1982. Although residents protested for six weeks, the toxic waste was eventually deposited in a landfill in the community.

However, Ben Chavis, the leader of the movement who coined the term “environmental racism” after being arrested, sparked a national movement. Although the battle was lost in Warren County, across the nation Black Americans and other people of color are fighting against a history of environmental racism, first stipulated by geographical racism during an era of segregation and Jim Crow laws.

The first step is to recognize this legacy to prevent additional polluting industries in Black communities — as with the Winston Weaver plant.

https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-democrats-set-gather-amid-dissent-about-priorities,Michigan Democrats set to gather amid dissent about priorities,"The issues are among those that made the cut — and did not — of 20 proposed priorities that members are expected to vote on Saturday during the party's annual endorsement convention in downtown Detroit.

Related:

The resolutions are largely symbolic in a convention that otherwise could lack drama and serve mainly to endorse the re-election candidacies of Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, along with candidates for the state Board of Education, university governing boards and the Michigan Supreme Court.

Far more fireworks are expected April 23, when Republicans meet for their convention in Grand Rapids to endorse GOP nominees for attorney general, secretary of state and judge candidates among crowded slates.

The resolutions highlight the Democratic Party’s priorities “at the moment,” party spokesperson Abby Rubley told Bridge Michigan.

As such, they underscore some conflicts.

Michigan Progressive Caucus Chair Abel Delgado, a Flint resident, told Bridge Michigan most resolutions do not touch upon racial injustice and are not enough to combat “Trumpism” and GOP efforts to ban things like the teaching of “Critical Race Theory.”

“We still have to go up against the fact that the GOP is mobilizing their base through racism,” he said. “We have to have a dominant narrative to address that, and we haven’t yet.”

Detroit-area party members wanted to submit a resolution opposing new redistricting maps that eliminate two majority-minority congressional districts but did not submit paperwork in time, said Jonathan Kinloch, chair of the 13th Congressional District Democratic Party that covers much of Detroit.

The resolution urges the state Supreme Court to send the maps back to Michigan’s redistricting panel, which prompted a lawsuit from the Detroit Caucus of Michigan Legislature. The caucus argued the maps would dilute the power of Black voters, but a judge dismissed the suit in February.

Kinloch said he missed the deadline by one day, and he found it “unusual” for the state party to dismiss the resolution. He said he will bring it back when Democrats meet again in the fall.

“In the past, for resolutions brought forward, we wouldn’t be so stern and strong (with the deadline),” he said. “We tried to be more lenient in our deliberations in the past.”

Some Democrats feel the state party did not speak out enough to support Black lawmakers’ lawsuit on redistricting, Kinloch said, stressing he is not one of them.

“There was a sense by some who felt … in the 13th District that the party did not want to take it up because they somehow felt that the party really was very supportive of these maps, because they gave Democrats more options to be elected to the demise of Black votes,” Kinloch said.

“A lot of folks felt in a meeting that the party did not speak out loud enough against these maps and help with any challenges.”

Cathy Albro, chair of the Michigan Democratic Rural Caucus, told Bridge that while she knows the list isn’t comprehensive, she hoped to see more resolutions addressing rural broadband services, clean water, tele-health expansion and social economic injustices.

“From my point of view, I think the last go-around was more comprehensive,” she said of last year’s convention. “I’d want to see more having to do with economic development and justice and education (as well).”

The resolutions

Instead, party members will vote on whether to urge the city of Monroe to remove a statue of Custer, who spent his childhood there and later was a Union general who also fought Native Americans before his death in the Battle of Little Bighorn,.

The debate over how to handle the monument has persisted for years in Monroe, with the city council agreeing in 2020 to update the monument with more information. In 2021, the city terminated a plan to hire an outside consultant to decide the future of the monument.

The Democratic resolution states Custer was ""notoriously known as the 'Indian Killer,'"" and the statue is a ""painful public reminder of the genocide of Indigenous peoples.""

“Decades of research show that racist policies, symbols, and behaviors are linked with lower well-being, educational barriers, physical health problems, employment problems, such as higher job turnover for people who endure racism and ethnocentrism like many American Indians and Alaska Natives,” the resolution states.

Another resolution would call upon the party to support legislation protecting burial sites outside federal or tribal lands.

The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act protects burial sites on federal or tribal lands, but state law governs burial sites elsewhere. There is no current Michigan law protecting those sites from intentional development, according to the convention resolution.

The Anishinaabek Caucus of the Democratic Party has pushed for both resolutions to raise awareness statewide, said caucus vice chair Nat Spurr.

“Where there are human remains or sacred artifacts, things along those lines, unfortunately, because of the lack of existence of these laws, we worry about people taking ownership … of these,” Spurr said of the reason the caucus introduced the burial site resolution.

“We basically want the support of the party as the foundation block,” he added.

Other resolutions

Almost half of the proposed resolutions urge the state Democratic Party to oppose GOP-led proposals and back liberal-leaning petition groups. The Michigan Democratic Party has already expressed its stance on several of them.

The party has spoken against a string of GOP-backed initiatives seeking to tighten election rules, establish a school voucher-like scholarship program and force a “forensic audit” of the 2020 elections.

Through a coalition called Public Health over Politicians, the party is also funding efforts against conservative ballot measure Unlock Michigan II, which seeks to limit the length of emergency orders from state or local health officials to 28 days, unless extended by the state Legislature or local governments.",Q2

TTP militant group escalates attacks against Pakistani security forces in recent months.

With the exit of Americans and the Afghan Taliban's takeover of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, there was a general sense of relief in Pakistan that its security woes along its western borders will be over. But over the past many months, activity in this region has witnessed a spurt, forcing Pakistan to purportedly conduct air raids inside Afghanistan on Friday.



Though the Pakistan Army's media wing, Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR), had not issued a statement as of Monday, a member of parliament, Mohsin Dawar, raised the issue on Sunday and claimed that innocent refugees from North and South Waziristan, once semi-autonomous tribal districts of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, who now live across the border in Afghanistan's Khost and Kunar provinces, were killed in these raids.



While a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad did not explicitly accept responsibility for the airstrikes, it did particularly highlight the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) escalated assaults across Afghanistan territory.



Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad on Sunday specifically mentioned retaliatory action against the TTP.



Afghan Foreign Ministry statement said Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Deputy Defense Minister Mullah Shirin Akhund met with the Pakistani ambassador and ""condemned the recent attacks on Khost and Kunar provinces, stressing prevention of such acts.""



""Minister Muttaqi said all military violations, including that in Khost and Kunar, must be prevented as such acts deteriorate relations between the two countries, allowing antagonists to misuse the situation leading to undesired consequences,"" the statement said.



It added the Pakistani envoy was given a strong demarche.



Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid also condemned the alleged attacks.



The death toll from Pakistan's military air raids on targets in the eastern Afghanistan provinces of Khost and Kunar on Saturday has risen to at least 47, Afghan officials said.



""Forty-one civilians, mainly women and children, were killed and 22 others were wounded in airstrikes by Pakistani forces near the Durand Line in Khost province,"" Shabir Ahmad Osmani, director of information and culture in Khost, told media.



The TTP, an umbrella organization for several militant groups, has upped attacks against Pakistani security forces in recent months, particularly in April.



On April 14, seven soldiers were killed when militants ambushed a vehicle of security forces in Datakhel town of North Waziristan tribal district. Officials said the militants attacked a moving vehicle of the security forces near the Afghan border.



According to tribal sources who requested anonymity, the attack was carried out by the Taliban's Hafiz Gubahadar group, the majority of whose members reside in the northeastern Afghan province of Kunar.



In the first three months of this year, 97 soldiers and officers were killed in attacks, Pakistan Army spokesman Lt-Gen Baber Iftikhar said at a press briefing on Friday, saying they were carried out across Afghanistan.



The TTP also claimed the killing of nearly a dozen Pakistani soldiers during an ambush in the Mirali area of the North Waziristan tribal district on April 2, declaring the launch of their new wave of assaults called Al-Badr, according to the militant's social media account.



On Sunday, the militants carried out four attacks on security forces in the tribal districts, two in South Waziristan, one in North Waziristan, and one in Bajaur, according to their Twitter account.



The ISPR, on the other hand, has not issued a statement on any of the incidents claimed by the TTP.



TTP claims of attacks are usually 90% correct, but their casualty figures on various social media platforms, particularly on Twitter, can be disputed, according to Mansur Khan Mahsud, who was also forced to relocate from South Waziristan to the capital Islamabad, where he works as executive director with a research institute, Fata Research Center.



The killing of TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone attack in June 2014, combined with the success of Pakistan's army's operation Rah-e- Nijat, prompted the militants to flee to Afghanistan. Nearly one million tribesmen from North and South Waziristan also sought refuge in the neighboring western country.



Later, within TTP, disagreements arose over leadership, and various factions split apart, Mahsud said.



Reports surfaced in August 2020 of a merger of several splinter groups, including Jamat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) and Hizb-ul-Ahrar (HuA), the outfits responsible for several major attacks in Pakistan, including the 2016 suicide bombing in a park in the eastern city of Lahore crowded with Christians celebrating Easter. Around 70 people were killed in the explosion.



Omar Khalid Khorasani, leader of the JuA, and Mukarram Khan, leader of the HuA, were persuaded to rejoin the TTP and pledge loyalty to the outfit's present chief, Mufti Abu Mansour Asim, also known as Noor Wali Mehsud.



According to a report compiled by the UN analytical and sanctions monitoring team in 2020, the total number of Pakistani foreign fighters in Afghanistan was estimated to be between 6,000 and 6,500, with the majority of them affiliated with TTP.



Geneses of TTP



When the US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, Pakistan, ruled by then-President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, agreed to play a frontline state role in the ""war on terror,"" deposing the Taliban's first government, which pushed millions of Afghans to flee to neighboring countries, mainly Pakistan.



Because the majority of Afghans share the same language and ethnic roots, Pakistan's seven former semi-autonomous tribal districts and other regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces welcomed Afghan refugees while condemning the US intervention and Pakistan's government for its support.



Among the refugees were several Afghan Taliban who had previously studied at Darul Uloom Haqaania, a well-known Islamic seminary located about 70 kilometers (43 miles) east of Peshawar, the provincial capital of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and who had connections with locals who studied at the same institution.



With anti-US sentiments running high in the region, tribesmen and the Afghan Taliban formed a loose alliance to fight back against the Americans, the Afghan government in Kabul, and the Pakistani government under Gen. Musharraf.



Gen. Musharraf narrowly escaped two assassination attempts in Rawalpindi, Pakistan's garrison city, in December 2003. The first was taken out with a roadside bomb, while the second was carried out by two suicide bombers who drove into his motorcade and detonated car bombs. At least 14 people were killed, with another 46 injured.



Maulavi Naik Muhammad of North Waziristan was the first to form a militant group in 2004, while the TTP was formally formed in June 2007, with Baitullah Mehsud of South Waziristan as its leader.



Failed cease-fire agreement



On November 8, 2021, former Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry declared that the government and the TTP had negotiated a complete cease-fire.



The declaration comes just over a month after then-Prime Minister Imran Khan revealed that the government was in negotiations with various TTP organizations in the hopes of reaching an agreement.



""There are different groups that form the TTP and some of them want to talk to our government for peace. So, we are in talks with them. It's a reconciliation process,"" the former prime minister had said during an interview with TRT World.



Later, the TTP confirmed that it had reached an agreement with the government on a month-long cease-fire in exchange for the release of its 102 men who had been imprisoned on terrorism-related charges.



According to the TTP's social media account, the release of 102 of their men and a one-month cease-fire are the first steps toward initiating negotiations for permanent peace.



Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Ameer Khan Muttaki confirmed the Taliban government's role as a peace negotiator during his three-day visit to Islamabad in the same month.



However, the TTP called off the cease-fire exactly one month later, claiming that the government had breached its promise to release inmates. And the problem has only gotten worse since then. -",Q2

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — A man arrested and charged in connection with a sexual assault that occurred in September in a parking lot at Dick's Sporting Goods Park was working security at the Phish concert in the hours prior to the incident, an arrest affidavit from the Commerce City Police Department (CCPD) says.

Around 6:15 a.m. on Sept. 5, a woman called 911 to report that she was sexually and physically assaulted after the concert in the bed of her pickup truck, which was covered by a camper shell.

The concert had taken place earlier in the evening and she was parked in lot G, the affidavit says. Since the concert is over multiple days, many people camp out on the concert grounds to attend the event.

When officers contacted the victim, she had ""observable injuries to her neck and arms,"" the affidavit says. The injuries included marks/bruising on her neck and both of her arms, according to the document.

She said the suspect was a man she had met earlier in the night whom she believed was named ""Demetri"" or ""Demetrius.""

On April 4, CCPD announced that Demetrius Wooden was arrested on March 31 in Grandview, Missouri, and extradited to Colorado. CCPD said through their investigation Wooden was also connected to a sexual assault in Denver that occurred in June.

Content warning: The text below contains details of physical and sexual violence that some people may find disturbing.

After the concert, the victim said she was hanging out on the grass when she was approached by the man, later identified as Wooden, who asked for a cigarette.

She stated they hung out for a while drinking alcohol and smoking pot, the affidavit says. During their interactions, she reported, Wooden told her he worked for Argus Security and had been assigned to work the concert on the evening of Sept. 4 and into the early hours of Sept. 5, according to the affidavit.

After a while, the victim reported that Wooden asked if she wanted to ""fool around,"" but she declined and said she was going to call it a night, the affidavit says.

A short while later, around 3:30 a.m., Wooden knocked on her camper shell and explained that he had missed the last bus and needed to wait until 6 a.m. for the next one, the affidavit says. He asked if he could wait inside the truck until then and the victim agreed, the document says.

The two talked for a bit, before, according to the affidavit, Wooden tried to have sex with the victim, who attempted to fight him. During that time, the affidavit says, Wooden choked the victim and tried to ""rip"" her clothes off.

The victim said Wooden choked her three times and the third time, she reported the pressure was so intense she ""felt like she was going to die,"" the affidavit says. At this point, the victim reported, she eased her resistance because she feared she might die if she ""kept fighting.""

Eventually, the victim said she was able to fight Wooden off and jumped out of the truck, the affidavit says. She called 911 at 6:16 a.m. and reported that Wooden told her she ""owed him"" for smoking his weed and that he was coming back to work security that evening.

According to the affidavit, Wooden sent an email to his employer at 6:45 a.m. explaining that he was calling out for that night and would not be in on the evening of Sept. 5.

Investigators contacted Argus Security and the company confirmed a person named ""Demetrius"" worked for them, the affidavit says. Police were able to contact that person and question him about an incident at Dick's Sporting Goods Park.

He admitted to investigators that he had sex with a woman, but said he believed it ""was consensual in nature,"" the affidavit says. He also described the victim's truck, according to the document.

A spokesperson for Argus Security said they will ""fully cooperate with Commerce City Police"" and said if convicted that they hope Wooden is punished to the fullest extent allowed.

Wooden was employed there between July 20, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021, at which time he was terminated. 9NEWS requested information about why he was terminated at that time but has not yet heard back.

According to the affidavit, Wooden has a prior sexual assault conviction in Minnesota in 2010 that required him to register as a sex offender. However, that registration period was only from May 2011 to May 2021.

He was no longer required to register with the state of Minnesota. Under Colorado law, he would have been required to register in Colorado until he obtained a court order to be removed from the Colorado Sex Offender Registry.

The affidavit, though, notes that it's likely Wooden was not aware that he had to continue his registration in Colorado.

Wooden faces the following charges in the Commerce City incident:

Sexual assault

Second-degree assault

Third-degree assault

He faces an additional sex assault charge related to the incident in Denver, according to CCPD.

In the Denver case, the victim communicated with Wooden through social media, according to a warrant for Wooden's arrest. They met up at a park and then Wooden asked if he could come to the woman's home on June 13, the document says.

After being at her home for about 10 minutes, the woman reported that Wooden asked her for sex but she declined. Ultimately, she said, Wooden forced himself on her, despite her telling him ""no"" repeatedly, the document says.

DNA from the scene came up as a match to the Commerce City case, and when DPD contacted CCPD, they were told that the suspect had already been identified as Wooden and a warrant for his arrest was issued.

A second warrant was issued for Wooden related to the Denver case in February of this year.

He faces two felony counts in Denver, including:

Sex assault by force

Sex assault - victim incapable

On Monday, Denver Police said Wooden might have committed additional sexual assaults over the past 10 years in states including Florida, Georgia, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota and other Midwestern states.

Anyone who thinks they were a victim of Wooden is encouraged to contact DPD Detective Steve Bishop at 720-913-6903 or steve.bishop@denvergov.org

Barrister Ali Zafar filed the petition in the apex court on behalf of PTI Secretary General Asad Umar seeking directions to bar the federal government and other relevant authorities from using coercive measures or intimidating tactics against party activists and leaders, who intended to participate in the long march towards Islamabad. Responding to the , the registrar said the Supreme Court had already decided on almost a similar issue vide Constitutional Petition 19/2022.

The registrar, in his note, said the petitioner had not approached any other appropriate forum available under the law for the same relief, and had also not provided any justification for not doing so. Controversial issues were mentioned in paragraphs 4, 5, 12, and 14 of the plea, he added.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan Thursday returned the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) petition to direct the federal and the Punjab governments not to torture or arrest or use any force or coercive measures or intimidating tactics against the its supporters, workers, members and leaders.

After raising objections over the petition, the SC Registrar Office returned the same saying that the applicant has not approached any other appropriate forum available under the law for the same relief and has also not provided any justification for not doing so. It further said, “The instant petition contains scandalous matter in para Nos. 4, 5, 12 & 14, hence attracts Order XVII Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules 1980.”

The Registrar Office order said that the petition is not entertainable as the Supreme Court has decided the similar issue vide constitution petition No.19/2022.

PTI Secretary General Asad Umar on 1st June had filed the petition under Article 184(3) of Constitution and cited Secretary Ministry of Interior, Inspector Generals of Police of all the four province and ICT, Home Secretaries of all provinces and Chief Commissioner ICT as respondents.

He prayed to the court to direct the authorities not to create any hindrance or obstacle whatsoever, including blocking access to or from any place or city in any manner (inter alia by putting up containers etc.) or from restricting the movement of the people in any manner and through any means, and also not use violence including force or any strong arm tactics against any citizen, supporter, worker, member or leader of the Petitioner who chooses to participate in the upcoming peaceful Assembly.

https://www.inforum.com/news/fargo/fargo-man-sentenced-for-robbery-spree-that-ended-in-pawnshop-shooting,Fargo man sentenced for robbery spree that ended in pawnshop shooting,"FARGO — A Fargo man has been sentenced to roughly three years in prison for a five-day robbery spree that ended after a pawnshop employee shot at his fleeing vehicle.

U.S. District Judge Peter Welte gave Hunter David Havisto the 38-month sentence on Tuesday, April 12, at Fargo’s federal courthouse. Havisto had previously pleaded guilty to three of five robbery counts. The other two were dismissed.

ADVERTISEMENT

The charges stem from five Fargo businesses that were robbed, some at gunpoint, in early June. Tropical Smoothie was the first on June 6, followed by Walmart and Casey’s General Store on June 8. All three are on 13th Avenue South.

The M&H gas station on Main Avenue also reported a robbery on June 9.

The last robbery came June 10 at Mister Money at 1404 33rd St. S. Havisto pointed a gun at employees and fled with $2,700, according to prosecutors.

Pawnshop employee Kyle Ramsey shot at the getaway vehicle and hit it several times, court documents said. The store’s owner said Ramsey did so to mark the vehicle, making it more noticeable to law enforcement.

Havisto was arrested shortly after the incident with a BB gun, which is believed to have been used in the robberies.

Ramsey eventually pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment in Cass County District Court.

Havisto also faced robbery charges in Cass County District Court, but federal prosecutors took over the case. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in North Dakota recommended 45 months in prison.

Havisto had suffered from a heroin addiction that became out of control, his defense attorney Christopher Bellmore said in court. He became increasingly dependent on the drug but got to a point where he couldn’t afford it, the attorney said.

“Mr. Havisto was desperate and made several poor choices that led him to court today,” Bellmore said in asking for a 30-month sentence.

Havisto had no intentions of harming anyone, Bellmore said. The defendant apologized in court, noting he already has served 10 months behind bars.

“I feel so terrible,” he said.

Havisto was shot at, Welte said, adding that much worse could have happened during the robberies. The judge commended Havisto for obtaining a GED while in jail but noted he has had more interactions with the criminal justice system as a 22-year-old than most have in their lives.

“That is just one sad statement,” Welte said.",Q2

Ever since the Taliban took control of Kabul in mid-August last year, the right to education, especially for girls, has been a major concern as the Islamic outfit has time and again flouted the basic human rights in Afghanistan.

Advertisment

The Taliban have issued a decree banning female students above grade six from attending their classes in schools. The girls were further told to stay home until the Islamic Emirate announces its next decision.

The decision by the Islamic Emirate has drawn severe backlash across the world with the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union issuing a joint statement to condemn the Taliban`s decision to deny Afghan girls the opportunity to go back to schools.

Advertisment

The envoys and representatives of the European Union, US, and the European countries in a recent joint statement have also said that the international aid to Kabul will depend on Afghanistan`s ability to ensure access to education for girls at all levels.

Advertisment

Although the first Taliban regime [1996-2001] remained a pariah state, the international law obligations of Afghanistan were not extinguished merely on account of that fact. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, during its 20 years of existence from 2001 onwards, was the legitimate vessel for the exercise of Afghanistan`s sovereignty, assuming all attendant rights and obligations, Global Watch Analysis said in its report.

Taliban`s U-turn on girls` education is most disconcerting. The decision, sudden and unexpected even for the executing officials, suggests that it might have been the whims of hardliners that prevailed over any step that returns the country to normalcy, the report said.

The order was not accompanied by any reasoning. There is no mention of any timeline by which schools shall once again be opened for girls, according to the report.

The system does not provide for any judicial remedy against such a drastic and draconian move. All these factors taken together, it is evident that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan does not follow the rule of law, however conservative, Global Watch Analysis reported.

Since the Taliban took control, Afghan girls are facing restrictions on travel, work, and education, besides their deteriorating safety situation in the country.",Q2

Notably, another power Reedy Creek enjoys is exemption from state law capping the rate at which property can be taxed, which means Disney can raise taxes (on itself) more or less as needed to make sure that the bonds are paid, making them an unusually safe investment.

Here’s the kicker. Per Schumer, the bonds include a pledge to investors from the state of Florida that the state won’t “limit” or “alter” Reedy Creek’s power to raise revenue to make payments until they’re paid in full. Which DeSantis and the state legislature just did by rescinding the district.

Two problems, then. First, under the terms of the rescission, Orange and Osceola counties inherit Disney’s obligations under the bonds despite having no way to make the payments. Even if they wanted to jack up property taxes sky high, infuriating their residents, they could only raise them so much before the state cap kicked in. Second, various constitutional provisions prevent the state of Florida from amending its own contractual obligations after the fact. Even if DeSantis and Florida Republicans could figure out a way to relieve Orange and Osceola of their new debt, in other words, they’d still be in violation of the pledge made in the bonds not to “alter” Reedy Creek. Schumer:

By dissolving Reedy Creek, the legislature essentially rewrote the promises made in the district’s bond offerings. Instead of bonds backed by a special district with the power to levy up to 30 mills in taxes, the property tax bonds will be backed jointly by two governments that can only generate a maximum of 10 mills in taxes. Instead of a unified utility system with special powers to charge various fees, supported by special taxing powers, utility revenue bonds will be jointly managed by two counties subject to additional taxing and spending restrictions. Both the U.S. and Florida constitutions place strict limitations on the government’s ability to impair its own contracts. Under the U.S. Constitution, a state can only impair an existing contract if the impairment is reasonable and necessary to serve an important government purpose. As early as 1866, the U.S. Supreme Court held that once a local government issues a bond based on an authorized taxing power, the state is contract-bound and cannot eliminate the taxing power supporting the bond. The Florida Constitution provides even greater protection from impairment of contracts.

Is Schumer wrong, tax lawyers? Or did DeSantis not have his own attorneys read the fine print on Reedy Creek’s obligations before nuking it from orbit?

It seems to me there are three potential solutions on the table now. One is to rescind the rescission and give Disney back its district, but for reasons I explained last night, DeSantis isn’t going to do that. Once you pick a fight to impress populists, you can’t quit without doing yourself damage. Another is for Florida to pay off Reedy Creek’s bonds, including all future interest owed, to eliminate the contractual problem. But that would be expensive — and illegal, again according to Schumer, who says Reedy Creek’s utility bonds contain a provision preventing redemption before 2029. Presumably the state could get bondholders to waive that provision if it’s willing to pay some sort of premium but how much will that end up costing Florida taxpayers?

Maybe Republicans don’t care. Charlie Sykes wrote this morning that the new hallmark of populist purity is being willing to do economic damage to your own constituents in the name of standing on principle. If DeSantis decides that Florida needs to cough up a billion dollars to pay off Reedy Creek’s bonds so that he can win this fight, plenty of righties will be willing to do that on the theory that we should bear any burden in prosecuting the culture war.

The final option is to go to court and (quietly) hope to lose, which is what I think DeSantis will end up doing. What choice does he have? He can’t back down and sheepishly admit that his team didn’t give due deliberation to Reedy Creek’s various legal entanglements before acting. That would amount to admitting incompetence. So he has to carry out this fight until a court tells him it’s over, which seems increasingly likely since each day seems to bring the discovery of a new legal landmine from the Reedy Creek move — First Amendment problems, property rights issues, now tax complications. Team DeSantis is going to step on one before a judge eventually.

Which will be a fine and familiar outcome for them. Noah Rothman notes today that some of DeSantis’s most crowd-pleasing populist initiatives (the “anti-riot” bill, the Big Tech legislation) have already run afoul of courts yet DeSantis has suffered no diminution in his “he fights!” cred as a result. “If a simple gesture of hostility in the general direction of a particular problem satisfies … right-leaning critics of cultural progressivism, then they are only in the market for theatrics,” Rothman argues. Relatedly, yesterday DeSantis signed a new bill creating an “election police” unit in Florida even though his state’s elections have been run exceptionally well and efficiently since the 2000 debacle and no one, including Democrats, questions the results there in 2020. The creation of election police is also “theatrics,” a small nod to “stop the steal” truthers that he sympathizes with their paranoia.

I think he’s counting on the same phenomenon recurring if a court throws out his hasty and apparently poorly vetted Reedy Creek bill. He’ll still get tons of credit from righties who appreciate his willingness to fight whether or not doing so produces any results in this case. And meanwhile an adverse ruling will spare him and the state the headache of being sued by Reedy Creek bondholders who want to know why Florida’s promise to them wasn’t kept. The theatrics are the important thing.",Q2

Wade,"By Aya Elamroussi and Gregory Krieg, CNN

Several states are working to protect abortion rights — and efforts were ramping up among Democratic leaders and lawmakers on Sunday — following the US Supreme Court’s ruling eliminating the federal constitutional right to an abortion, with Saturday marking the first full day without the nationwide protection in nearly 50 years.

The impact of Friday’s historic ruling that struck down a 1973 legal precedent known as Roe v. Wade was felt immediately, with at least 10 states effectively banning abortion as of Saturday night. Another five states are expected to enact varying trigger laws limiting abortion in the coming days and weeks, including Wyoming, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Idaho.

In all, 26 states have laws that indicate they could outlaw or set extreme limits on abortions, effectively banning the procedure in those states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.

Georgia already has its own restrictive law that bans abortions when a “fetal heartbeat” can be detected at about six weeks into a pregnancy. That legislation, passed and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, was suspended by a federal court in Atlanta, but is now set to take effect.

On Sunday, Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is challenging Kemp in this year’s gubernatorial election, acknowledged the six-week ban will be Georgia’s “law of the land” within days.

Live updates: Roe v. Wade latest news

“That is horrendous, that is appalling and it is wrong. As the next governor, I’m going to do everything in my power to reverse it,” Abrams told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”

Abrams called on President Joe Biden do “do what is within the purview of the executive” to mitigate the effect of the court’s ruling, but focused her message on broader, federal legislative action. “There should be federal law that allows women to have these choices, to have reproductive choice and reproductive justice,” she said.

That, however, is extremely unlikely given the makeup of the Senate, where Democrats hold a razor-thin majority and lack the votes to overcome the filibuster, a procedural hurdle that requires 60 members to bring such a measure to the floor for an up-or-down vote.

In the meantime, other Democrats are taking a more DIY approach to what many have described as a national health crisis. Since the ruling came down on Friday morning, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has raised an estimated $400,000 for abortion rights groups — including tens of thousands during a widely-viewed Instagram Live late on Saturday evening, a spokeswoman told CNN.

Ocasio-Cortez, on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday morning, also suggested Biden expand access to abortion through a variety of means, including the opening of clinics on federal lands inside states that have or plan to enact bans, and to use the tools of the executive and federal agencies to help make medical abortion, through pills obtained via the mail, more easily accessible.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a similar plan of action during an interview with ABC’s “This Week,” saying the federal government should consider every available legal path to mitigate the new bans and aid states where women are expected to travel to seek legal abortions.

Advocacy groups, meanwhile, are pressing ahead with new legal arguments within the states — in some cases digging into their own laws for potential avenues to slow or upend new restrictions.

In Utah, which is among the states that moved quickly to ban most abortions following Friday’s ruling, Planned Parenthood has already filed a lawsuit against the state’s top leaders, claiming its newly enacted law violates multiple civil liberties codified in the state’s constitution.

Performing an abortion in Utah under its ban is now a second-degree felony in nearly all cases, according to the lawsuit, which names the governor and the attorney general among the defendants. (The Utah law allows for abortion in three circumstances — where there is danger to the mother’s health, uniformly diagnosable health conditions detected in the fetus or when the mother’s pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.)

The lawsuit argues the new abortion law violates multiple rights protected under Utah’s constitution, such as the right to determine family composition and equal protection rights, among others. It also says the law has a disparate impact on women as opposed to men, and violates the right to bodily integrity, involuntary servitude, as well as the right to privacy.

“When the Act took effect, PPAU (Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Association of Utah) and its staff were forced to immediately stop performing abortions in Utah beyond those few that are permitted by the Act. If relief is granted in this case, PPAU’s health centers would resume providing abortions that would not qualify for any of the Act’s exceptions,” the lawsuit reads.

CNN has reached out to Gov. Spencer Cox’s office for comment on the lawsuit but did not receive a response Saturday. Attorney General Sean D. Reyes’ office told CNN it had no comment on the lawsuit.

In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vowed to “fight this decision in every way we can with every power we have,” after his Republican-controlled state legislature declined to repeal the state’s 1849 law banning abortion, which is taking effect again following the Supreme Court ruling.

“Our office is reviewing today’s decision and will be providing further information about how we intend to move forward next week,” Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement Friday.

Dozens of prosecutors from blue cities and states have also released a signed statement saying they will not prosecute abortion providers or patients — an early sign that calls for civil disobedience will also find a home with some law enforcement officials, many of whom have discretion in their enforcement practices.

In a letter published by the advocacy group Fair and Just Prosecution, 83 elected prosecutors said they would not use official resources “to criminalize reproductive health decisions.”

“Our legislatures may decide to criminalize personal healthcare decisions, but we remain obligated to prosecute only those cases that serve the interests of justice and the people,” the prosecutors wrote. “Criminalizing and prosecuting individuals who seek or provide abortion care makes a mockery of justice; prosecutors should not be part of that.”

NYC Pride shows solidarity with abortion rights movement

Demonstrators both for and against the high court’s decision have been taking to the streets this weekend in small towns and big cities across the nation.

At Sunday’s Pride parade in New York City, organizers expressed solidarity with the abortion rights movement by announcing a contingent from Planned Parenthood would be the first group on the route.

Many of the marchers waved Pride flags or held bright pink signs that said, “I stand with Planned Parenthood,” and chanted, “We won’t back down.”

The annual Pride march tracked some of the same streets that demonstrators marched on Friday night and into the weekend, when New Yorkers and visitors to the city — some of them canceling plans so they could take part — joined to protest the court’s ruling.

The scenes in Manhattan followed 48 hours of almost uniformly peaceful protests, though some cities announced small numbers of arrests.

Police in Virginia are also investigating an alleged act of vandalism at pregnancy center in Lynchburg.

Officers responded to a call Sunday where they found broken windows and messages — including, “If abortion ain’t safe you ain’t safe” — spray-painted at the site.

“Security camera footage shows four masked individuals committing the acts,” police said in a statement.

A day earlier, hundreds of people gathered in Greenville, South Carolina, in response to the ruling. At least six people were arrested at the rally, which included people protesting and supporting the ruling.

Emily Porter, 23, told CNN she was protesting when she saw police take a woman to the ground after she stepped down from a sidewalk and walked across the street.

“I felt very angry to watch them take an older woman to the ground,” Porter told CNN. “If they wanted to detain her, they could have done it in a respectful manner.”

After the woman was tackled, several people left the sidewalk to come to her aid, prompting police to detain them, Porter said.

“I’d never thought I’d be in the middle of all this,” Porter told CNN. “I was angry, I was afraid and I was confused.”

Greenville police said neither Tasers nor pepper spray was used during the arrests and authorities would review the incident.

In the nation’s capital, police arrested two people Saturday after they were accused of “throwing paint over the fence by the U.S. Supreme Court,” US Capitol Police tweeted.

In New York City, at least 20 people were “taken into custody with charges pending” during the initial round of protests against the ruling, police said. No further details were provided on the arrests.

On Friday night in Phoenix, law enforcement used tear gas to disperse a crowds of protesters who were demonstrating in front of the state Senate.

Protecting reproductive rights

As some states move to restrict abortion rights, others are taking steps to better protect and expand abortion access and funding.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz issued an executive order Saturday providing protections for people who travel into the state for reproductive health care from states where abortion is illegal or criminalized, his office said.

“Our administration is doing everything we can to protect individuals’ right to make their own health care decisions,” he said in a statement.

The announcement comes as Red River Women’s Clinic — the only clinic that performs abortions in neighboring North Dakota — is preparing to move its services to Minnesota. North Dakota is one of many states that have trigger laws on the books aiming to ban abortion following the Supreme Court ruling. Its law will go into effect 30 days after the ruling is certified by the state’s attorney general.

Also Saturday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee promised to create a “sanctuary state” for reproductive choice for people across the country.

In doing so, Inslee announced an upcoming executive order that will direct state police not to comply with extradition efforts from other states seeking to penalize those who travel to Washington to receive an abortion. He didn’t specify when the executive order will be released and or when it will take effect.

https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/negligible-change-in-race-relations/,Negligible change in race relations,"“Hate will not prevail. White supremacy will not have the last word.”— President Joe Biden.

The recent mass killing of 10 individuals at the Tops Friendly Market on Jefferson Avenue in East Buffalo, New York, on May 14 has once again raised the matters of racism and gun control.

According to officials, the white teenage gunman, 18-year-old Payton Gendron, drove some three hours to commit this racially motivated hate crime in the predominantly black neighbourhood. The news reported that 11 of the 13 victims were black. As reported by authorities, the suspect, who lives about 200 miles away in Conklin, NY, drove to the Tops store on May 14 and around 2:30 pm opened fire in the parking lot, killing three people and wounding a fourth. Armed with an assault-style rifle, he then entered the store and shot customers and workers before surrendering near the lobby, where he was met by law enforcement.

One has to ask the question: What if the Buffalo gunman was black, would law enforcement officers allow him to surrender or would law enforcement have engaged him in a gunfight? Police said he live-streamed the shooting from a camera atop a helmet he wore as part of his armored gear.

Tops Friendly Market was the only accessible supermarket on the east side of Main Street, where more than 80 per cent of the residents are black and the median household income is less than US$20,000 per annum. It operates about 150 supermarkets in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.

The shooting at Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, New York, comes seven years after the horrific shooting at a Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, which took the lives of nine African Americans. The shooter was 21-year-old Dylann Roof. The Charleston massacre was a clear act of white supremacist violence and hatred. African Americans continue to be hunted down by white supremacists and this is problematic.

THE GREAT REPLACEMENT THEORY

The Great Replacement Theory (GRT) has its roots in early 20th century French nationalism and books by French nationalist and author Maurice Barres. However, it was French writer and critic Renaud Camus who popularised the phrase for today’s audience when he published an essay titled Le Grand Remplacement or The Great Replacement in 2011. Camus himself alluded to the Great Replacement Theory in his earlier works and was apparently influenced by Jean Raspail’s racist novel in 1973, The Camp of the Saints.

Camus believes that native white Europeans are being replaced in their countries by non-white immigrants from Africa and the Middle East, and the end result will be the extinction of the white race. Camus focused on Muslim immigration to Europe and the theory that Muslims and other non-white populations had a much higher birth rate than whites.

It is clear this Camus’s racist theory of white supremacy has gained traction and wide appeal, not only in some European countries, but in North America and as far away as Australia and New Zealand. However, Camus’s initial concept did not focus on Jews and was not anti-Semitic.

This philosophy was quickly adopted and encouraged by the white supremacist movement as it fits into their conspiracy theory about the impending destruction of the white race. In March 2019, white supremacist Brenton Tarrant live-streamed himself killing 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand. Tarrant also released a manifesto online called ‘The Great Replacement’ as homage to Camus’s work.

HATE CRIMES

We live in a time and age where hate, discrimination, and prejudice are hallmarks of many societies. The virtual space has become poisoned and many individuals have become radicalised via the Internet. We must be guarded regarding what we allow our minds to entertain.

In October 2018, white supremacist Robert Bowers killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after posting a message blaming Jews for bringing non-white immigrants and refugees to the USA.

In August 2019, white supremacist Patrick Crusius opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 23 people and wounding almost two dozen. In a manifesto, Crusius talked about a “Hispanic invasion” and made reference to the great replacement.

On October 27, 2018, 11 congregants in a Pittsburgh synagogue were killed in one of the deadliest attacks against the Jewish community in the US. The shooter’s belief in the Great Replacement Theory precipitated the attack.

Hate crime is defined by the Department of Justice as a crime motivated by bias against race, colour, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability. The term ‘hate’ can be misleading. When used in hate crime law, the word does not mean rage, anger, or general dislike. In this context it means bias against people or groups with specific characteristics that are defined by the law. At the federal level, hate crime laws include crimes committed on the basis of the victim’s perceived or actual race, colour, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.

MAINSTREAM DISCOURSE

Those of us who are privileged to have a social media platform space must be careful of the messages we expound as oftentimes we are influencers, whether or not we like it.

The Great Replacement Theory, which was once relegated to white supremacist rhetoric, has unfortunately found its way in the consciousness and discourse of mainstream society. Among the supporters of this “racist” discourse is Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who complains repeatedly that the Democratic Party is attempting to “replace the current electorate” with “third-world voters”. Since Carlson’s comments, numerous public figures on the far right have echoed or supported this “great replacement” theory which has also been called “white replacement theory” or simply “replacement theory”.

In the USA, there are sections of the Republican Party that have embraced this malignant theory, which represents a clear and present danger to each and every person in the minority. Undoubtedly, evil, hatred, and violence have sprung from the ideas of this theory.

We have witnessed the rise of xenophobia all across the United States of America. Simply Psychology states that xenophobia originates from the Greek word ‘xenos’, which means ‘foreign’ in the most standard definition, although it can also be interpreted as ‘guest’, depending on the context. It also originates from the word ‘phobos’, meaning phobia. Xenophobia is a general term which can be applied to any fear of someone who is different from the individual. It can often intersect with a person’s race, ethnicity, nationality, and any aspects that may be used to distinguish people as others.

Often there are overlaps between xenophobia and forms of prejudice, including racism and homophobia. There are two main types of xenophobia. One has to do with individuals who have culturally xenophobic views and may reject objects, traditions, or symbols which are associated with another group, for instance, clothing and music that is traditional for another culture and different languages. People who are culturally xenophobic may believe their own culture and traditions are superior to those belonging to other groups.

The other is immigrant xenophobia, which is characterised by the rejection of people or groups of people who are seen as not being a part of the society’s in group. Individuals with this type of xenophobia may consider people in their own social or cultural group as being superior to others, avoid places heavily populated by immigrants, or make negative comments about people who belong to other cultures or countries.

The cause of xenophobia can be complicated. Evolutionary psychologists argue that xenophobia may be a part of genetic behavioural heritage, in that, being fearful of outside groups protected ancestral humans from threat.

BLACK LIVES MATTER

Not surprisingly, a counter ideology is always in place to temper racist ideologies such as the Great Replacement Theory.

In 2013, three female black organisers, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, created a black-centred political and movement-building project called Black Lives Matter.

Black Lives Matter began with a social media hashtag, #BlackLivesMatter, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin back in 2012. The movement grew nationally in 2014 after the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York. Since then, it has established itself as a worldwide movement, particularly after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Most recently, the Black Lives Matter movement has spearheaded demonstrations worldwide protesting police brutality and systematic racism that overwhelmingly affects the black community. Race relations in the USA have always been contentious and combative. A significant number of controversial court rulings over the years have incensed the African-American community as justice is often viewed as a two-tiered system, one for the whites and one for blacks.

Many minorities are of the belief that the justice system is seen through the lens of Anglo-Saxon and as such blacks are disproportionately incarcerated in comparison to whites for similar crimes.

As people of colour we should not let our guards down for one moment as the intersection of race, gender, and politics continue to shape and influence differing opinions, some of which will be troubling and discriminatory. As we continue this journey we need to find avenues to navigate this shared interconnected global environment. We all belong to the same race, the human race.

In the words of Barack Obama, none of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight. Every time something like this happens, somebody says we have to have a conversation about race. We talk a lot about race. There’s no shortcut. And we don’t need more talk.

https://haitiprogres.com/news/2022/05/12/newsreel-19/,"Latest News, Breaking News, National News, World News, Haiti News","The security situation in the country does not seem to be getting any better and is in fact becoming an epidemic all unto itself. It appears the financial gains by the gangs have been so lucrative that there’s no indication that things may get better for ordinary people anytime soon. Dozens of heavily armed gangsters have taken to the main thoroughfare, the National 2 in Martissant 2, 4 and 23 to force passengers in public transports that ply the route to pay ransom before allowing them to continue their journey. Those who use this road are now at their wit’s end, because they have no choice and do not know how to extricate themselves from the daily harassment and abuse from these heavily armed gangs that seem increasingly bold and comfortable in their menace to the society. As these operations were going on in the early hours of Monday, May 09, 2022, there seem to be no police presence in the area. At the same time, the interim police commissioner was getting ready to give a report on his half year tenure at the head of the security apparatus.

At a press conference to report on his achievements and plans for the future, the interim police chief, Frantz Elbé stated his intention to strengthen the security approach in such areas as Cul-de-Sac and other hot beds of insecurity in the country, to prevent further insecurity in those areas. Mr. Elbe stated that the PNH will be more present in such areas and will present more effective opposition to the gangs and regain full control of the neighborhoods currently under gangs’ control. The police announced that during the armed clashes between rival gangs, 400 Mawozo and Chen mechan on Sunday, April 24, 2022, 54 people were arrested, 16 weapons and 7 vehicles as well as a number of motorcycles were confiscated during operations carried out in the Plaine du Cul-de-Sac neighborhood. Several bandits were killed and three police officers were injured. In addition, Commissioner Elbe is said to be delighted by unifying the high command with the PNH, an institution that was previously rocked by protest movements for the creation of unions, as well as the formation of the group known as Fantom 509. Mr. Elbe thanked the public their cooperation and patience as the police address the security concerns, while stressing that the PNH will not be beholden to any political group, nor any sector in the country but will only be there to serve the population.

Meanwhile, a UNICEF report on the severity of the security situation in the country indicated that at least 75 people, including women and children were killed and 68 others wounded during the clash between rival gangs in Croix-des-Bouquets and Tabarre and Cite Soleil. The report further stated that at least 12 homes have been deliberately set on fire, burning at least five people alive in Cite Soleil. The international body is said to be concerned about the security and human rights issues in the country, especially in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. At least 9000 people have been forced to leave their homes and seek shelter in churches and schools or with families willing to take them in or practically leaving for other departments across the country. While condemning the closure of dozens of schools and health care facilities, the UN also highlighted the food scarcity and water in the affected areas. In fact, 1,700 schools have been closed in the metropolitan area.

In an article that appeared on yahoo.com, former senator John Joel Joseph who was suspected in the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and attended a key meeting with Colombian commandos on July 6, the day before the assassination, was charged in US courts. He was first detained in Jamaica before being brought to Miami Friday. Mr. Joseph admitted in an interview that he helped obtain vehicles and tried to get firearms for the co-conspirators’ “operation” targeting Jovenel. Mr. Joseph’s goal was to become the prime minister under Moïse’s successor following the leader’s removal from office. Mr. Joseph’s admission collaborates with that of a Haitian police investigation that placed him at a meeting with one of the four men police claim had gained access to the president’s private bedroom as part of “a delta team.” Haitian police also identified a known gang leader as among the people Joseph had contact with before the assassination.

On Monday, Joseph agreed to be detained before trial in Miami federal court, telling a magistrate judge the case was “very sensitive” and that “I trust the American justice system.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined pro-abortion activists outside the Supreme Court Friday to protest the historic overturning of Roe v. Wade by the nation’s highest court.

Ocasio-Cortez can be seen chanting the word “illegitimate” in reference to the decision alongside activists, according to video footage shared by TPUSA contributor Drew Hernandez. The New York Democrat was also seen shouting “into the streets,” in an apparent call for Americans to partake in public demonstrations against the ruling.

Several people on social media identified Sunsara Taylor of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, as the woman holding a bullhorn receiver for Ocasio-Cortez and directing the crowd’s chants.

Earlier Friday, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, deciding that the Constitution does not include a right to abortion, thus returning the issue of abortion laws to state legislatures. Justice Samuel Alito authored the court’s 5-4 decision.

“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Alito wrote. “The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely — the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”

https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/92890-gambia-validates-truth-commission-work-and-promises-justice.html,Gambia validates Truth Commission's work and promises justice,"After five months of silence, the Gambian authorities yesterday published a position paper expressing intent to implement the recommendations of the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), “notably the prosecution of ex-President Yahya Jammeh, for a myriad of crimes committed between 1994 and 2017” and of several other top officials for murdering dozens of citizens during his 22-year rule.

Jammeh, living in exile in Equatorial Guinea since January 2017, ruled the small West African country with an iron fist, using a paramilitary hit-squad called the Junglers which disappeared at least 103 people, according the report of the Truth Commission, released last year on Christmas Eve. At least 232 people were found to have been murdered by state agents from July 1994 to December 2016 - the precise period that falls under its mandate.

“The government accepts all the recommendations by the TRRC with regard to prosecution, notably the prosecution of ex-President,” states the government position paper.

According to this document, Jammeh’s crimes include at least 19 incidents of illegal executions by Junglers: execution of 12 soldiers; unlawful killing of former Finance Minister Ousman Koro Ceesay; killing of at least 17 road users; killing of 15 students; murder of journalist Deyda Hydara; murder of 67 West African migrants; random execution of 27 other people; 41 deaths caused by the Presidential Alternative Treatment Programme for AIDS; and 41 deaths caused by witch-hunting.

Several torture charges were also approved to be brought against Jammeh. In addition, he faces at least two rape cases.

""The crimes of which Yahya Jammeh has been accused, including widespread murder, torture, rape and arbitrary detention, clearly constitute crimes against humanity,"" said Reed Brody of International Commission of Jurists. Brody, instrumental in bringing ex-Chadian dictator Hussein Habre to justice, has been working with Jammeh’s victims to help them mobilise support to bring him to justice.

Special prosecutor’s office

The 178-page government white paper fell short of detailing how, when and where these prosecutions were to happen. “The government intends to create a special judicial framework within our domestic court system for the prosecution of perpetrators of human rights abuses and violations,” said the government’s position paper. “The [special] court shall be located within the Gambia with the option of holding sittings in other countries based on the exigencies of each case.” Based on this model, Jammeh can be prosecuted in Ghana, Senegal or Nigeria over murder of their citizens in 2005.

The prosecutorial task will be handled by a special prosecutor under the Ministry of Justice. “The special prosecutor’s office shall be aided by a special investigations unit under the Ministry of Justice,” said the government. The office will have local and international experts to guide and conduct its investigations and prosecutions, it also said. And the government promised several legislative amendments including the enactment of the torture laws.

Already, the Jammeh-era crimes have been tested before the courts. Yankuba Touray was convicted in the country for the murder in June 1995 of former Finance Minister Ousman Koro Ceesay. Bai Lowe - a former Jungler - is currently facing charges in Germany of crimes against humanity for involvement in the murder of journalist Deyda Hydara in December 2004. Seven top heads of the National Intelligence Agency are standing trial in Gambia for the April 2016 murder of Ebrima Solo Sandeng.

Abroad, prospective cases hang over Ousman Sonko, Jammeh’s longest serving interior minister, in Switzerland, and Michael Sang, a Jungler currently detained in the United States.

Three recommended for amnesties

The Truth Commission made 265 recommendations, of which the government formally rejected only two. One was a request to amnesty Sanna Sabally, the former vice chairman of the military junta. The government also rejected the TRRC’s qualification of judges who helped Jammeh as “mercenary judges”.

The government accepted three amnesty recommendations from the TRRC: for two junior soldiers implicated in November 11, 1994 executions, Baboucarr Mboob and Zakaria Darboe; and for a soldier involved in the 1995 torture of political detainees, Major Bubacarr Bah. The government also accepted to grant Alagie Kanyi immunity on the basis of the willingness he expressed to testify on the murder of Ousman Koro Ceesay and the November 11 execution of soldiers. He was involved in both executions as a junior soldier and was a star witness for the state in the murder trial of Yankuba Touray.

The government’s decisions are not without controversy. It refused to penalize the current head of the National Intelligence Agency for tampering with evidence. Justice Minister Jallow argued that the evidence tampering charge against Ousman Sowe came in May 2017, falling outside the timeframe the Commission is mandated to investigate. However, critics contend that his conduct violates the TRRC Act.

The second controversial position was the refusal of the government to penalize Yankuba Sonko, who was until recently Interior Minister, for his involvement in the cover-up of the killings of the West African migrants. Sonko was recommended to be banned from public office for 10 years but the government declined.

Meanwhile, the position paper said there is also a possibility of granting amnesty to some Junglers, depending on how useful they are to the state’s prosecutorial plans.

For instance, the Commission recommended for a denial of Malick Jatta’s application for amnesty “on the basis that although he gave full disclosure, showed remorse and helped the Commission in its investigation, his acts form crimes against humanity.” But the Commission further recommended “that the State could grant him immunity should it wish to use him as a witness.” On his specific case, the government said that it “will evaluate Lieutenant Malick Jatta’s utility as a witness in line with its prosecution strategy”. The same immunity deal is being evaluated for Junglers Omar Jallow and Pa Ousman Sanneh.

‘Jammeh deserves a day in dock’

According to the government’s commitments, Jammeh will not be the only person to have his days in the dock. All his accomplices in the military and former top officials connected to rights violations, including former vice president Isatou Njie Saidy, are to be prosecuted for past rights violations.

Fatou Barrow is a 22-year old daughter of Omar Barrow, a Gambian Red Cross volunteer who was shot dead on April 10, 2000. Fatou was 5 months old when he was murdered.

“I have heard stories about how he was a good man and ambitious… I have heard he was always ready to help people,” said Fatou. “You can imagine the pain in my mother’s heart when she was just 22 years old and widowed with a 5-month old baby. That is not easy. Jammeh and others should face justice.”

The when, how and where is still sketchy. But yesterday, Fatou was pleased to learn that the Gambian government had undertaken to bring to justice Jammeh, ex-vice president Isatou Njie Saidy, ex-interior minister Ousman Badgie, and ex chief of defence staff Babucarr Jatta.

Now, the former leader lives under the protection another dictator, in Equatorial Guinea. No international warrant has been issued, and no extradition request made. It has not even been decided whether Jammeh will be prosecuted in the country or elsewhere in the region.

“The government could make it very difficult for Equatorial Guinea to resist a demand for Jammeh’s extradition by lining up the support of ECOWAS and the entire region, in particular countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Cote d’Ivoire whose migrants were allegedly murdered under Jammeh’s orders,” said Brody. “A request coming from an ECOWAS or even an AU-backed court would be very difficult to refuse, but the impetus, the initiative, has to come from the Gambian government.”",Q2
https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2022/05/the_silent_invasion_and_war_at_home.html,The Silent Invasion and War at Home,"It has been chilling to watch the steady number of deaths, the territory invaded, the executions and rapes, the fear and the flight. It is especially shocking because we had peace for so long, but now we see all the possibilities of evil coming out.

I'm not talking about Ukraine — I'm speaking of an invasion right here in the United States. Migrants, mostly Hispanic, are entering the U.S. at the rate of at least 2 million per year — or 20 million in the next decade — and with them come hundreds of thousands of violent gang members. Meanwhile, our own inner-city gangs are spreading out into affluent suburban areas, invading high-end shopping areas and stealing from stores and individuals, often at gunpoint and with deadly consequences.

I am not being alarmist or racist. I am simply describing what is happening and pointing out the future state of affairs if we do nothing. If anything, my numbers are low, and my words cannot describe the horror of what is happening.

The most numerous victims of this invasion are blacks and Hispanics who are attacked by young men of their own race. These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and this is a topic that mainstream news won't cover because the killers are mostly black and Hispanic. Just in 2020, the year of the ""defund the police"" protests, murders of blacks soared by 32%, and they're only continuing.

We're seeing an explosion in the number of carjackings and car thefts, along with murders, home invasions, rapes, assaults, and other violent crimes, not just in our cities, but in suburban areas as well. And authorities cannot or will not do anything to stop it. There has always been violent crime in Chicago, but now there seems to be a crime wave, and it includes the murder of children, police officers, and the elderly. The authorities mumble about ""root causes,"" but social work won't reduce the numbers. We are at war, and war requires the use of force.

The perpetrators are largely the same in every location: young black and Hispanic men, heavily armed and with no apparent conscience or morality. They prey on the weak and take what they want, which seems to be money, sex, drugs, and a certain kind of street cred that they mistake for status.

These thugs now control the streets, even in many smaller cities. Mayors like Lori Lightfoot seem to have given up. They attempt to change the subject and ignore the problem, just as the Biden administration does.

Biden ignores the fact that we have been invaded by a powerful army of young men of similar backgrounds and natures — ruthless gang members and repeat offenders with the same teardrop tattoos signifying their having committed murder, the same cold, haughty stare, the same hostile swagger, and domineering speech. These criminals have become so familiar that even some middle-class whites, through popular culture and rap music, have mistaken them for Robin Hood–type heroes.

They are anything but heroes. They inflict suffering and death on everyone around them. Like half-starved lions released into the Coliseum, they exist only to murder and prey on the weak.

More Americans have died in this war over the past decade (some 200,000) than Ukrainians who have died in their war (13,000 according to a recent count), and American cities are beginning to resemble the bombed-out shells of civilization we see in Mariupol and Kharkiv. The difference is that everyone notices the destruction in Ukraine, but few understand the magnitude of violent crime in the U.S. If the media coverage were honest and proportional, Americans would demand change.

We have been invaded by an army that is worse than that of Russia. Unlike the hapless conscripts who constitute those Russian forces, the thugs who roam America are remorseless. If anything, they enjoy killing since it inflates their sense of power, especially their power over whites, and particularly white police officers, though black victims are hardly exempt. They are lean, muscled, and street-tough, and they are not afraid of getting caught since in most places there is no real punishment for ""common"" crimes like stealing cars or home break-ins, and little punishment for violent crime as well.

The invaders we face are violent and lack all compunction, but they are not all that numerous. They fit a similar profile — a certain type of young minority drop-out, stealing or selling drugs — but according to several estimates, they constitute at most one-quarter of their demographic and a smaller percentage of Hispanics. Indeed, most blacks and Hispanics live in fear of these invaders, just as most whites do.

The Ukrainian army has repelled Russian forces in many areas. If the Ukrainians had been properly armed, they might have turned back the Russians at the beginning and saved their country so much suffering and destruction. In America, we don't even realize we have been invaded, or else we refuse to admit it. It's not ""woke"" to say that young black men commit murder at 18 times the rate of the general population. Not woke to say, as is true, that twice as many whites are murdered by blacks as are blacks by whites. Not woke to point out that fully one-quarter of black men ""end up in the criminal justice system,"" as Bernie Sanders has it.

One does not defeat an enemy by allowing it to murder, steal, and rape without resistance. The only way is to recognize that we have been invaded, and are at war. War requires its own way of thinking and its own tactics and strategy. At present, we arrest criminals (a few of them, since 54% of reported violent crimes and more than 75% overall go unsolved), charge them with a lesser offense, release them (in many places without bail), and watch them go right back to committing crimes. That is the wrong strategy for a state of war.

It is possible to defeat our enemy, but it will take a change of attitude. We must be willing to fund our police at maximum levels, support our police in their dangerous work, and indemnify them against unreasonable prosecution in their use of force, and we must elect prosecutors who actually prosecute this army of invaders. The recall of L.A. district attorney George Gascón might be a good start.

We are under attack, and the situation is getting worse. The only way to defeat an invading army is with greater force. We need to provide that force so that we can live safely once again.

And now New Yorkers will be asked to go to the polls in the middle of August to vote in the primaries for congress and state Senate.

A June primary is already set for statewide elections, including governor. And while there had been some discussion about moving it back to align with the new August 23 primary date, Gov. Kathy Hochul put that speculation to rest on Friday.

What You Need To Know A judge has set August 23 as the date for the state Senate and congressional primaries



Governor Hochul says statewide primary, including for governor, will remain in June as planned



Lawmakers are considering a bill to drop Brian Benjamin’s name from the ballot after he resigned as lieutenant governor earlier this month

“There is an election that will occur at the end of June,” Hochul said at an unrelated event in Albany. “That is established. That is being certified. That is the plan right now, to continue with a June election.”

But more questions remain, including what the process will be for gathering signatures to qualify for the ballot with a new electoral calendar. Hochul says she still doesn’t have those answers.

Per @mikemurphy33 Steuben County Supreme Court has granted Democrat’s request to extend the timeline for submitting new congressional lines to tomorrow and agreed to move up senate lines submission to May 4 from May 5, as they requested — Zack Fink (@ZackFinkNews) April 29, 2022

“I assure you that after working on this over the weekend, we will have more information available on what the future will bring probably on Monday or Tuesday. So, I will be able to answer all of your questions on those topics at that time when we have more information to share,” said Hochul.

Democrats, meanwhile, are getting attacked by opponents who say their gerrymandering led to this mess, which threw New York’s election process into uncertainty.

“We were looking at this issue and this case on the merits, not on the politics,” said Republican State Senator Mike Martucci. “And when you look at it on the merits, I believe our state’s highest court came to the right decision. And as to the question of what is happening around Democrats? Clearly they are in disarray.”

This is the first time the court has taken such decisive action, although it would not be the first time the state has held two separate primaries in a single year. In 2012, Congressional and state primaries were on different days.

“The courts have never really weighed in on redistricting over the many years, and there have been legal challenges every ten years, forever, certainly in modern times there have been legal challenges. And the courts have traditionally stayed out of it. And my guess is Democrats we’re banking on the same passivity or conservative approach,” said Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group.

Lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow Hochul to drop Brian Benjamin from the ballot for the June primary. Benjamin resigned as lieutenant governor earlier this month over a corruption scandal.

https://www.fox9.com/news/oklahoma-hospital-shooting-several-wounded-some-killed-police-say,"Oklahoma hospital shooting: 4 people killed, suspect dead, Tulsa police say","A gunman carrying a rifle and a handgun killed four people on Wednesday at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical building on a hospital campus, police said — the latest in a series of mass shootings across the U.S. in recent weeks.

The shooter also was dead, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Tulsa Police Department Deputy Chief Eric Dalgleish confirmed.

It was unclear what prompted the deadly assault in Tulsa, Dalgleish said. The shooting took place on the second floor of the Natalie Medical Building which is part of the Saint Francis Health System.

""It appears both weapons at one point or another were fired on the scene,"" Dalgleish said. ""The officers who arrived were hearing shots in the building, and that's what led them to the second floor.""

Police responded to the call about three minutes after dispatchers received the report at 4:52 p.m. and made contact with the gunman roughly five minutes later, at 5:01 p.m. Dalgleish said.

Police Capt. Richard Meulenberg also said multiple people were wounded and that the medical complex was a ""catastrophic scene."" The exact number of wounded was not immediately available.

Police and hospital officials said they were not ready to identify the dead.

St. Francis Health System locked down its campus Wednesday afternoon because of the situation at the Natalie Medical Building. The Natalie building houses an outpatient surgery center and a breast health center. Dalgleish said an orthopedic clinic also is located on the second floor where officers discovered the shooter and several victims.

Investigators are interviewing witnesses at this time and the scene is secure.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt released a statement on Twitter, calling the shooting ""a senseless act of violence and hatred.""

""What happened today in Tulsa is a senseless act of violence and hatred. Sarah and I are praying for the families of those who lost their lives and for those who were injured. I am grateful for the quick and brave actions of the Tulsa Police Department and other first responders who did their best to contain a terrible situation. I have offered Mayor G.T. Bynum any state resources that may be needed, and I ask all Oklahomans to come together in support of the Saint Francis Health System community and to grieve with those whose lives have been forever changed,"" Stitt’s post read.

Dozens of police cars could be seen outside the hospital complex, and authorities shut down traffic as the investigation went on. A reunification center for families to find their loved ones was set up at a nearby high school.

Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also at the scene, a spokesperson said.



""@ATFDallasTulsa office personnel are on scene at St. Francis Hospital to provide assistance in the active shooter incident. Tulsa Police Department is the point of contact and will release more information as it becomes available,"" the bureau tweeted.

The Natalie Medical Building houses an outpatient surgery center and a breast health center.

Earlier on Wednesday, the chief of police advised people to avoid the area near 61st and Yale Avenue, which is the location of the Natalie building, according to local news media.

Just a few days before the incident, Tulsa police apprentice officers underwent active shooter training to prepare for ""real-life scenarios,"" according to a Facebook post from the department.

""All Tulsa Police Officers also receive updated training and learn new tactics around Active Shooter Scenarios during their In Service Training, which happens yearly. This training has been scheduled for months, but is incredibly timely due to the recent school shooting in Texas,"" the post read in part.

The past few weeks have been riddled with gun violence as Americans mourn the loss of life in Texas, New York, California and now Oklahoma.

News of the Oklahoma shooting comes less than two weeks after a tragic mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, which left 19 children and two teachers dead.

And just a little over a week after the Texas mass shooting, another shooting took place at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, where an 18-year-old gunman killed 10 Black people.

And just one day after the New York shooting, on May 15, five people were injured and one person was killed inside a church in Laguna Woods, Calif.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden over the weekend traveled to Uvalde, Texas, to grieve with a community that he said made clear to him they want to see Washington tighten gun laws in the aftermath of the shooting rampage that killed 19 children and two teachers. Biden heard similar calls for an overhaul of the nation’s gun laws earlier this month when he met with families of 10 Black people who were killed in a racist attack at a Buffalo supermarket.

A bipartisan group of senators held a private virtual meeting Tuesday to try to strike a compromise over gun safety legislation, but expectations remain low. Senators aren’t expected to even broach ideas for an assault weapon ban or other restrictions that could be popular with the public as ways to curb the most lethal mass shootings. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who led the session alongside Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., called Tuesday’s talks a ""very constructive conversation.""

House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler also plans to hold a hearing Thursday on the ""Protecting our Kids Act"" — a package of eight bills that has almost no hopes of passing the Senate but would serve as a marker in the debate. It includes calls to raise the age limits on semi-automatic rifle purchases from 18 to 21 years old; create a grant program to buy back large-capacity magazines; establish voluntary safe practices for firearms storage and build on executive measures to ban bump stock devices and so-called ghost guns made from 3-D printing.

https://truthout.org/articles/ukrainians-gained-protected-status-in-days-it-took-years-for-cameroonians/,Ukrainians Gained Protected Status in Days. It Took Years for Cameroonians.,"The call came at 4 am. Emmanuel Tabili immediately leapt out of bed, jolted awake by the thought of trouble in his home country of Cameroon, 8,000 miles away in west Africa. He was relieved to recognize a work number. It was a colleague in the struggle to gain Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for almost 40,000 Cameroonians living in the U.S., telling him to get ready for some good news for a change. April 15 would be a day to remember.

“They said it looks like there’s some action, like it’s going to be positive, and that inside sources said it was going to be approved,” he told Truthout. TPS, which was created by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990, was Tabili’s (and the activists who preceded him) prized goal because those who gain it become authorized to work in the U.S., are free to travel and, most significantly, are protected from deportation.

A few months after winning his own asylum case in 2018, Tabili went to work for Haitian Bridge Alliance in southern California as an advocate for Haitian and Liberian migrants. After two years, his experience led him to help form the Cameroon Advocacy Network (CAN), which was launched as an offshoot of Haitian Bridge Alliance with cofounders Guerline Jozef and Daniel Tse last year. Since then, he’s crossed state lines to Washington, D.C. 20 times to impress his message on officials and to speak at rallies as an “impacted person.”

Within two hours of that 4 am phone call, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) issued a press release in which he announced that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas had promised that TPS for Cameroonians was going forward. Van Hollen, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy, had written two bicameral letters to President Biden in recent months — the first with Rep. Karen Bass (D-California) in November and another with Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) on March 23 — calling for TPS for Cameroonians.

Encouraged by the morning’s momentum, nonetheless, Tabili stayed cool. “I didn’t want to be rash about it,” he said, “because there were other times I had raised my hopes, even prepared a thank you message, but it never got released.”

The last such occasion was a month earlier when the quick action taken by the administration on TPS for Afghans and Ukrainians made advocates’ complaints of anti-Black bias in the dispensing of immigration protections all too credible. After a full-court press on what they thought were all the right levers, taken in concert with their partner organizations — Haitian Bridge Alliance, CASA, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, United Africa Organization, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Amnesty International USA — they were so close they could smell the whiff of victory.

“But at the last minute, the administration took a total U-turn,” he recalled, “and it killed our dream.” CAN and the partner organizations may never know precisely why things went south, though some now surmise it may have been related to secret talks between the government of Cameroon and Russia about forming an alliance. A defense pact signed on April 12 recently made public might explain the reversal. At the time, Tabili says there was frustration and anger toward the administration for abandoning them and leaving them in the dark as to why. “We felt demoralized because we have been fighting for this for so long.”

Six Years to Gain What Afghans and Ukrainians Received in Just Days

Advocates in the U.S. saw the need for TPS for Cameroonians starting in 2016, as tensions between English- and French-speaking forces escalated into open conflict. Tabili explained that in the first year of the conflict, more than 50,000 people were internally displaced, and in the second year, the number rose to 300,000; now it is over a million. A small number of these people made the arduous and dangerous trek to the U.S. In 2016, only 115 refugees from Cameroon were granted asylum, per the Office of Immigration Statistics Annual Flow Report, increasing to 218 in 2017. This was before Tabili came to realize he, too, would have to leave his country. He has since led a full-blown human rights effort to extend the protection that TPS should provide universally to his countrymen forced out by multiple regional conflicts painstakingly documented by Human Rights Watch in a terrifying report.

“The difficulties of the journey from Cameroon test your humanity. You go through countries where you don’t speak the language, where you are assaulted, maybe raped. Your property is stolen, you experience racist slurs, all of this, just in the hopes of making it to the U.S.”

“The difficulties of the journey from Cameroon test your humanity, test every part of you,” Tabili said. “You go through countries where you don’t speak the language, where you are assaulted, maybe raped. Your property is stolen, you experience racist slurs, all of this, just in the hopes of making it to the U.S.” Holding degrees in both political science and foreign relations and diplomacy, and being involuntarily schooled in the cruelty of the U.S. immigration system during 11 months of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention in Georgia, Tabili was both primed for the policy battle and steeled against the system’s resistance to change, no matter how just.

Fueling his anxiety on the morning of April 15, the press release from DHS scheduled for release at 9 am, was delayed. Tabili recalled that it was only when it was posted two hours later that he allowed himself to feel the elation of victory — with a stroke of a pen, every Cameroonian foreign national already in the U.S. on April 14, 2022, was now eligible to apply for TPS. If granted, they can enjoy the protections for 18 months from the date DHS publishes notice in the Federal Register.

Cameroonians who come seeking asylum after April 14, 2022, will not be eligible for TPS, but Tabili thinks given the humanitarian turn, a few may feel encouraged to try anyway. Colleagues in D.C. did pop a bottle of champagne, but as with any longed-for change, no matter how positive, when it finally arrives, it’s often tinged with a taste of the bittersweet. Granting TPS to Cameroonians was a political decision that could have come at any time, and as the years dragged on the human costs mounted.

“I don’t know how I can really describe the emotions that came with it, because the delay in TPS for [Cameroonians] had cost countless lives. Those we know and those that we don’t know,” he explained. “The people that were deported, we cannot account for many of them.”

In August 2021, Truthout spoke to a Cameroonian asylum seeker, Divine Tikum Kem, who had been forcibly deported from Louisiana and was the subject of a formal complaint brought against DHS, the Department of Justice, ICE, and other officials by the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative. Kem said then: “I lost my fight [referring to his deportation]. Today, whatever we are fighting for is for other people not to be terrorized by what we went through — that no other Black migrant should go through this again in this century. I believe my cry can be heard; I pray my voice will not cease.”

Tabili’s thoughts were also with the Cameroonians still scattered throughout the country held in ICE detention, a number he estimates to be somewhere between 300 to 600. Secretary Mayorkas’s announcement did not speak to their fates. A request to Sarah Loicano, the ICE public affairs officer in New Orleans, for information on their number, status under TPS, and plans for their release went unanswered by press time. On background, a reliable source informed us that the process remains the same: detainees (through an attorney) or sponsoring relatives can request supervised release from ICE.

“It also hurts, you know, to think of all the people who have been living in fear,” Tabili added, “and who have not been fully productive because someday someone could knock on your door and take everything from you, and send you back to the misery you came from.”

A Second Wind for the Short Strokes to the Finish Line

Returning to the moment a month prior when the advocates were demoralized, CAN and the partner organizations met to discuss next steps. Tabili remembers they spoke freely, venting their frustration and anger at what they felt was the administration’s hypocrisy. The energy was deflated, even depressed, and he was as tired as everyone else. But giving up would mean turning off the lights and hopes of the Cameroonians who needed protection and saw CAN’s platform as the stepping stone to get there. A gut-level political instinct kicked in, and he reached back to prior generations for a spark of inspiration.

“My grandmom Lya used to say that things get really difficult when there is a significant breakthrough,” he remembers telling others at the meeting. “And it is usually very easy for people to give up at that point. But I want to remind you that we have come a long way, and we shall not waste our good efforts because the administration is in denial. We will braze up and fight again like never before.”

According to a fact sheet published by the Pew Research Center in January 2022, Biden’s large immigration bill includes a proposal for a somewhat streamlined path to citizenship for TPS recipients: “The proposal would allow TPS holders who meet certain conditions to apply for citizenship three years after receiving a green card, which is two years earlier than usual for green-card holders.”

Knowing how quickly a year and a half can pass, CAN views the 18 months as a starting point that gives the administration time to figure out what to do next. What they want and will be working toward is a clear path to citizenship for all TPS holders.

“It would be unfair if after 18 months people were sent back to the same conditions they fled,” says Tabili.

We’re not backing down in the face of Trump’s threats. As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we’re not shouting into a faceless void – we’re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate. Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations – either through need or greed – rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump’s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won’t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. Truthout and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths – a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government. Over 80 percent of Truthout‘s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations. Over a third of our total budget is supported by recurring monthly donors, many of whom give because they want to help us keep Truthout barrier-free for everyone. You can help by giving today. Whether you can make a small monthly donation or a larger gift, Truthout only works with your support.

New York Times fact-check reporter Linda Qiu noted that, after adjusting for population, Chicago's rate of gun homicide was the 26th highest in the country in 2020. ""The three cities with the highest gun homicide rates — Jackson, Mississippi; Gary, Indiana; and St. Louis — had rates double that of Chicago's or more. All are in states with more permissive gun laws than Illinois,"" Qiu wrote.

On Tuesday, May 24, an 18-year-old gunman opened fire on children and teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.

Two teachers and 19 children were killed, making it the deadliest school shooting since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. Over an hour after police arrived, law enforcement shot and killed the gunman at the scene.

On July 17, 2022, the Texas House of Representatives released a committee report detailing its investigation into the shooting and a timeline of events that occurred before, during, and after the massacre.

September 2021 to February 2022: The shooter asks his sister to help him buy a gun and purchases gun accessories and ammunition

While still 17, the shooter asked at least two people, including his sister, to buy him a gun, but both refused, according to the report. In November 2021 and February 2022, the shooter also bought several gun-related accessories online, including rifle slings, a military vest, and 60 rounds of ammunition, the report says.

April 2022: The shooter starts to allude to plans of violence on social media

On April 2, 2022, the shooter asked an Instagram user if they would ""remember me in 50-something days"" in a message. When the user responded ""probably not,"" the shooter said ""we'll see in May,"" according to the report.

""The attacker often connected those dates with doing something that would make him famous and put him 'all over the news,' and many of those with whom he chatted suspected his cryptic deadlines meant violence,"" the report says. ""For example, in a May 14th conversation he simply wrote '10 more days.'""

May 16, 2022: The shooter buys a semiautomatic rifle the day after he turns 18

He bought two assault weapons in the days after he turned 18 on May 16, 2022, the report says.

On May 16, he purchased a Daniel Defense AR-15-style rifle and 1,740 rounds of ammunition, according to the report.

Texas State Sen. Roland Gutierrez also said the gunman's posts on social media ""suggested the kids should watch out,"" the AP reported.

May 17: The shooter purchases a second 'Ar-15 style' rifle

The next day, the shooter bought a Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle and returned the following day to buy an additional 375 rounds of ammunition, spending a total of at least $4,897 on weapons, according to the report.

May 24, morning: schoolchildren prepare for end-of-year festivities

Students had been invited to wear ""a nice outfit with fun/fancy shoes"" as part of the school's end-of-year celebrations, according to a schedule posted on the school's Facebook page. These celebrations included an honor roll award ceremony.

The students at Robb Elementary had two days left in the school year.

May 24, 11:21 a.m.: The gunman sends a text message saying he shot his grandmother

At 10:50 a.m., the gunman texts a friend in Germany telling her he was angry at his grandmother and going to ""do something to her rn.""

Fifteen minutes later, he sent two more messages saying he shot his grandmother and is going to shoot people at the school. The German teen responds with one word, according to the report: ""Cool.""

11:28 a.m.: The gunman crashes into a ditch near the school

Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw said the shooter had been living with his grandmother since March 2022, and he used her car to drive approximately two miles, crashing when he was ""about a block and a half away from the school.""

""He crashed the vehicle at that point in time,"" McCraw said in a press conference after the shooting. ""He exited with a backpack. He took a rifle with him.""

Eduardo Trinidad, an eyewitness to the aftermath of the crash, told local outlet KPRC-2 that the vehicle went through a barricade and into a concrete ditch.

Juan Carranza told the Associated Press he also saw the crash and that the gunman fired at two people outside a nearby funeral home.

11:29 a.m.: A teacher sees the gunman approaching the building, closes the open door on the school's west side, and calls 911

Police originally said a teacher left a door open on the school's west end that allowed the gunman to enter the building, but surveillance video shows the educator closed the door before he reached it, the report says.

11:31 a.m.: The gunman walks through the school's parking lot

Public safety officials originally said an armed school resource officer approached the gunman before he entered the school, and that there was an exchange of gunfire.

But Victor Escalon, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a press conference days later that wasn't true.

""It was reported that a school district police officer confronted the suspect,"" Escalon said. ""That's not accurate,"" he added. ""[The gunman] walked in unobstructed initially.""

Related stories

In the 12 minutes between arriving at and entering the school, the gunman shot at two funeral workers and the school itself before police showed up.

11:31 a.m.: school resource officer drives past gunman, accidentally confronts teacher instead

Texas law enforcement officers said a school resource officer drove past the 18-year-old gunman outside Robb Elementary School and accidentally confronts a teacher instead.

After a teacher calls police to report that someone had crashed a vehicle in a ditch at 11:30 a.m., the gunman then began shooting at the school, McCraw told reporters during the press conference.

11:33 a.m.: The suspect enters the school

The shooter enters the school, likely through the door on the west end of the building that the teacher had closed earlier, the report says.

The door was either ""already unlocked or the lock failed to engage, which the teacher could not have known because the doors lock from the outside,"" the report says.

According to the report, none of three exterior doors to the school were locked, which is a violation of school policy.

The shooter walks through the hallway and then enters room 111 and starts shooting, the report says. The shooter briefly leaves the room, then returns and starts shooting again in rooms 111 and 112, which were connected.

He fired at least 100 rounds in just over two and a half minutes inside rooms 111 and 112, the report says.

""The attacker fired most of his shots and likely murdered most of his innocent victims before any responder set foot in the building,"" the report says.

Speaking on the ""Today"" show, Lt. Chris Olivarez said the shooter had ""barricaded"" himself in a single classroom where all his victims were clustered. Notably, the shooter was able to do this despite the school district's comprehensive security plan, which included police officers and locking doors.

""He began shooting children, teachers, anybody that was in his way. He was shooting people that were in front of him,"" Olivarez told KPRC-2.

11:35 a.m.: Officers arrive and enter the school

At 11:35 a.m., two separate groups of police officers enter the building through two different doors, the report says. One of the doors that police entered through was the same door the shooter used to get into the building.

11:37 a.m.: The shooter fires at officers and drives them back

Two officers approach the divider between rooms 111 and 112, but the suspect fires at them, causing building debris to graze the officers, the report says. Both officers did not return fire, according to the report.

11:38 a.m.: Law enforcement believes the shooter is contained

Uvalde Police Chief Pete Arredondo checks room 110 and tells other officers there were no children inside because it was awards day, the report says.

Arredondo testified that ""he prayed that if Room 110 was empty, the children might be gone from the rooms occupied by the attacker as well.""

Police began treating the shooter as a ""barricaded subject"" rather than an ""active shooter"" at this point, and never changed their designation of his threat level throughout the altercation after it, the report says.

11:43 a.m.: School officials post a public notice saying they're on lockdown

""Please know at this time Robb Elementary is under a Lockdown Status due to gunshots in the area. The students and staff are safe in the building. The building is secure in a Lockdown Status,"" read a notice posted on the school's Facebook page.

Shortly after came another post: ""There is an active shooter at Robb Elementary."" The school said law enforcement was ""on site.""

Onlookers urge law enforcement to confront the shooter

Onlookers outside the school urge police to charge the scene and confront the shooter, even getting so frustrated with the inactivity that they suggest rushing the school themselves.

Javier Cazares, whose fourth-grade daughter, Jacklyn Cazares, died in the rampage, said he arrived to the scene and saw law enforcement officials waiting outside the building.

""Let's just rush in because the cops aren't doing anything like they are supposed to,"" he told the Associated Press. ""More could have been done. They were unprepared.""

A spokesperson from Texas' Department of Public Safety told Insider at the time that it was his ""understanding"" that ""several law enforcement responded and started to make entry into the school to evacuate students, teachers, and staff.""

A mother breaks a police line to rescue her kids

Angeli Rose Gomez, a mother of two students at Robb Elementary, runs past a police line and jumps a fence to rescue her children from the school, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Related stories

Gomez said she drove 40 miles to the school after hearing about the shooting, and found law enforcement just standing outside when she got there.

Parents scream at officers to enter the school

Videos uploaded to social media show Texas law enforcement personnel hold back desperate parents as they scream for officers to go into the school.

The footage captures a large group parents in a parking lot, pleading with officers, as school buses and police cars could be seen in the background. Many people are screaming and crying.

It's unclear if the video was taken during or after the shooting.

11:51 a.m.: police sergeant and US border agents start to arrive

Border Patrol agents couldn't get into the classroom and were forced to ask a staff member to open the door with a key, an anonymous law enforcement official familiar with the events told the Associated Press.

""At that point, we had a tactical law enforcement team arrive made up of multiple federal officers, local officers as well as state troopers, that were able to make forcible entry into that classroom,"" Olivarez said.

""They breached it, engaged the active shooter, and continued to keep him pinned down in that location afterwards until a tactical team could be put together,"" McCraw said, noting the tactical team included border patrol agents, local police officers, and sheriffs.

Initially, McCraw said the gunman was shot and killed around 40 minutes after his encounter with the school resource officer.

But then McCraw offered a drastically different version of events, strung together by 911 calls made by students locked inside classrooms during the shooting as officers remained in a hallway.

In a matter of days, the Texas authorities changed their timeline of events at least 13 times.

12:03 p.m.: Officers assemble in the hallways and students begin to call 911

The 911 calls placed by students suggest the gunfire lasted long after authorities said they arrived at the school.

At 12:03 p.m., a girl called 911 and identified herself through whispers, the report says. The call lasted for exactly one minute and 23 seconds, according to the report.

The Texas House committee report said the committee ""received no evidence that any officer who did learn about phone calls coming from inside Rooms 111 and 112 acted on it to advocate shifting to an active shooter-style response or otherwise acting more urgently to breach the classrooms.""

The girl was identified as Amerie Jo Garza by her grandmother, The Daily Beast reported. Garza's grandmother told the Beast she had just received her award for the school's honor roll. She did not survive.

The Uvalde police chief said in a statement that officers responded to the shooting ""within minutes,"" but did not address if those officers actually went inside the school building.

12:10 p.m.: another 911 call

The same student called 911 again, and told the operator that multiple students were dead, the report says.

12:11 p.m.: Chief Arredondo requests a master key

Arredondo requests a master key, which became his ""primary focus of his attention for the next 40 minutes,"" according to the Texas House committee report.

12:13 p.m.: another 911 call

The student called 911 a third time.

12:15 p.m.: Border Patrol Tactical Unit arrives

Officers waited in the hallway until a Border Patrol Tactical Unit arrived at 12:15 p.m.

12:16 p.m.: Student makes another 911 call and says 8-9 students are still alive

The student called 911 and explained for a third time that several of her classmates and one of her teachers were dead. She said her other teacher was wounded and hiding in room 112, the report says.

12:19 p.m.: another 911 call

A different student in classroom 111 called 911, and hung up after a classmate advised her to keep quiet.

12:21 p.m.: shots heard on 911 call

During that call to 911, McCraw said three shots could be heard over the phone. McCraw said it's believed he was firing at the door. At that point, officers waiting in the hallway moved closer, but had to ask a janitor for keys into the classroom, McCraw said.

A fourth-grade boy who survived the shooting told KENS 5 about the harrowing moments he and his classmates first realized they were under attack. After firing a shot at an adjoining door, the shooter walked into the young boy's classroom, he said.

""He came in and he crouched a little bit and he said, he said 'It's time to die,'"" the fourth-grader told the outlet.

12:36 p.m.: another 911 call

The first student who called 911 called back and told the operator that the gunman shot at the door.

12:45 p.m.: Border Patrol Tactical Unit goes in

A Border Patrol Tactical Unit disregards orders to not engage with the gunman 30 minutes after their arrival on the scene, NBC News reported.

12:50 p.m.: Border Patrol Tactical Unit kills the gunman

""They breached the classroom door. They went in, engaged (the shooter), and killed him at the scene,"" McCraw said.

Shots were heard over the student's 911 call, as well as the sounds of officers moving children out of the classroom.

That was 77 minutes after the gunman entered the school, and 75 minutes after police arrived on the scene.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2022-06-24/san-diegans-protest-scotus-decision-overturning-roe-v-wade,Thousands of San Diegans protest SCOTUS decision overturning Roe v. Wade,"DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO — Thousands gathered at two separate rallies Friday night in downtown San Diego to protest the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and strip away constitutional protections for abortions.

About 1,000 people crowded around the steps of the Hall of Justice before setting off on a march through the streets of downtown.

Around the same time that procession began, another group of more than 1,000 was gathering near Waterfront Park outside the San Diego County Administration Center.

Both groups decried the court’s decision that upended the landmark 1973 opinion Roe v. Wade, which upheld a woman’s right to abortion without government restrictions.

Tori Barron, who works for Planned Parenthood, told the group at the Hall of Justice that Friday’s decision was “outrageously undemocratic” and that “the people are going to fix this … from the bottom up.”

Said Barron: “I’m angry, I’m scared, but I’m ready to fight back.”

Signs at both protests called abortion access a healthcare issue and said there is no way to ban abortions, only to ban safe abortions.

“Forced motherhood is female enslavement,” read one man’s shirt. A woman held a sign that read, “Saving embryos by killing women.”

At the protest outside the county building, a group of pediatricians stood near the front of the large crowd as officials from the local Planned Parenthood and ACLU branches spoke. The county building was lit in pink Friday night in what the county called “support of efforts to amend the California Constitution to enshrine the right to choose.”

Around the same time that larger protest and candlelight vigil outside the county building ended, the marchers from the previous rally arrived at Waterfront Park. Some leaving the other protest joined the march.

A protester named Joni held a sign with different messages on each side. “Separate the church & state women will decide our fate,” read the pink side. “Democracy or theocracy? Get the Christian Taliban out of SCOTUS,” read the yellow side.

“I’ve been at this 32 years now,” Joni, who declined to provide her last name, said as she marched toward the back of the group and showed off a three-decade old abortion rights T-shirt. “Every couple years we come back to the streets … it recycles and repeats over and over, but this is absolutely the worst, most extreme I’ve ever seen.”

Joni said she worked for Planned Parenthood for eight years and always feared this day would come. But since it hadn’t for so long, she was “in denial, until this morning.”

The Supreme Court “has gone too far,” Joni said. “And this time, they’re going to move on to birth control, they’re going to move on to who we love, what happens in our bedrooms.”

Like Joni, many who gathered Friday feared the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority and has lurched even further right in recent years following three appointments by former President Donald Trump, will next turn its attention to rolling back LGBTQ rights and even the use of contraceptives.

Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion to Friday’s decision, wrote that the same rationale the Court used to declare there was no right to abortion should also be used to overturn the court’s 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage, a 2003 decision striking down laws criminalizing gay sex and a 1965 decision declaring that married couples have a right to use contraception.

“They have no shame,” Joni said.

Protesters continued marching throughout Friday night, though the group thinned considerably as the night wore on. At one point, the group passed next to Petco Park just minutes before the Padres recorded the last out against the Philadelphia Phillies, sending fans streaming into the Gaslamp Quarter. Along Fifth Avenue, as protesters marched and chanted slogans like “my body, my choice,” young women inside crowded bars and restaurants came outside to cheer them on.

The march ended just before 10:30 p.m. back at Waterfront Park, where members of local socialist political groups called on the few dozen remaining protesters to start a general workers’ strike beginning Monday.",Q2
https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2022/06/25/acosta-decries-backward-us-declares-pregnancy-centers-insufficient,"Acosta Decries Backward U.S., Declares Pregnancy Centers Insufficient","In a shocking development, CNN Newsroom host Jim Acosta acknowledged the existence of pro-life Democrats and welcomed one, Kristen Day, onto his Saturday show to discuss the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling. Unfortunately, the same liberal talking points remained as Acosta decried the U.S.’s lack of “stellar company” on the issue while suggesting that pregnancy centers aren’t good enough.

Acosta led Day, who is the executive director of Democrats for Life of America, by showing a new found respect for Sen. Joe Manchin, “Here’s what Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said about Roe v. Wade, quote, ‘it's been the law of the land for nearly 50 years and was understood to be settled precedent. As a Catholic, I was raised pro-life, always considered myself pro-life, but I've come to accept that my definition of pro-life may not be someone else's definition of pro-life.’”

He then decried America’s supposed backwardness, “According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, the U.S. joins only three countries: El Salvador, Nicaragua, Poland, that have chosen to roll back abortion rights since 1994. That isn't exactly stellar company.”

Day corrected the record by pointing out the reality is precisely the opposite, “when you look around the world, when you look at Europe, most of Europe has abortion bans after 12 weeks, 13 weeks. So, you know, the U.S. has been out of line with the majority of the world up until now.”

As a native Virginian, Day also referenced Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s desire to enact a new 15-week ban and cited, “Pregnancy centers are -- do incredible work, they are often demonized because they have a religious -- a lot of them have a religious aspect to them. But if you go and visit one, I would urge you, I can take you to one or two, and you can see that they have diapers and clothing. Up until, you know, they support women.”

Acosta then interrupted, “Well, diapers and clothing might not cut it.”

Day would go on to mention that these centers also provide job training and housing and that they have been “doubling and tripling over the last decade.”

It has been a common retort that pro-lifers aren’t really pro-life, just pro-birth, yet when they step up, it still isn’t good enough for Acosta.

https://www.wisfarmer.com/story/news/2022/05/31/farmer-mental-health-emphasized-roundtable-arlington/9996531002/,Bringing farmers' mental health struggles out of the shadows,"Jan Shepel

ARLINGTON – At times farmer Randy Roecker's depression was so overwhelming he would drive out to the back forty, sit in his truck and just cry.

The depression he felt in 2008 over the financial situation on the family farm nearly cost him his life.

“We never knew what depression was until then. We were losing all this money. It was devastating,” the Sauk County farmer recalls.

Mental health is a subject not many farmers will broach. They are an independent and stoic bunch – not wanting to complain or share their feelings too much – and are unlikely to ask for help if they feel depressed or anxious. Fortunately there are several programs designed to develop solutions to overcome those challenges.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Deputy Secretary Jewel Bronaugh joined Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin at a roundtable discussion on farmer mental health at the Arlington Agricultural Research Station Friday, May 27, and spoke of various efforts at the federal level aimed at helping farmers, including a $25 million grant program called the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN).

Baldwin said she and Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, introduced a Farmers First Act which was then incorporated into the 2018 Farm Bill. “The input we have gotten is that having a stable amount of funding coming through USDA was really impactful and it is a top priority for the next Farm Bill,” she said. “We hope to authorize a higher level of funding to expand the programs.”

Funding sources for services

Bronaugh said that besides the allocation and grants through the Farm Bill, the agency is utilizing existing resources to help get at these challenges. “We are using resources from Rural Development and other areas. Since telemedicine and distance learning can be part of the solution, broadband expansion will help. Money is available to all 50 states and our goal is to continue this conversation.”

Baldwin says Farmers First Act authorized $10 million per year, and noted more money was made available via the American Rescue Act. The Wisconsin senator believes the funding will continue at authorized levels.

“So many factors are beyond farmers’ control – the price of what they have to buy things at and the price they get for what they sell,” Baldwin said. “No one should have to work as hard as dairy farmers work and not make a living. I don’t know of any farmers who aren’t undergoing stress.”

Other issues being addressed on the federal level – tariffs, supply chain issues and things as diverse as lock and dam repairs on the Mississippi River so crop farmers can get their grain into international markets –contribute to farmers’ stress levels, Baldwin said.

“There are so many moving parts and we’re doing what we can to address as many of them as possible,” Baldwin said.

Bronaugh added that solutions to the problems of mental health and substance use disorders have been prioritized by the Biden administration. “The conversation is being elevated to the highest levels,” she said.

No return to normal

Joy Kirkpatrick says in the 30 years she has served in the role of UW-Extension’s Farm Succession and Outreach Specialist, she remembers what the 80s did to farm families, how low milk prices of 2008-09 impacted dairymen and the devastation of crops during the 2012 drought.

“We dealt with them as individual events under the concept that when they were over we’d return to ‘normal’,” she told roundtable attendees. “Since 2016 there have been so many challenges everywhere that we now understand we are not going to return to any sort of normal.”

Identifying stressors

Her current work is part of a grant with the FRSAN, bringing together focus groups and farm families to identify stressors farmers are dealing with and what they feel are barriers to getting help for their mental health.

Farmers in the focus groups say not having time away from the farm is a big stressor along with ongoing financial concerns and stress associated with farm succession decisions.

Kirkpatrick has worked closely with the Farm Center at the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection on which families and farmers should be part of the focus group.

A next step in the project will be to bring together people who work with farmers – veterinarians, technicians, milk haulers – to be trained in identifying farmers that are in crisis.

Unfortunately those agribusiness workers and professionals are just as busy and overworked as the farmers, Kirkpatrick said. “Farmers are independent and stoic and do not like to ask for help. Farmers are not going to say they are suicidal.""

Another component of the project is to connect with health care providers to help them understand what farmers deal with in their line of work and in their daily lives.

The $400,000 grant under which Kirkpatrick operates is funded through August 2023.

Subject no one wants to talk about

Roecker says depression is a subject that no farmer or farm family wants to talk about. However, he and his family were forced to deal with it head-on in 2008. “We had borrowed all this money and built a new dairy in 2006 and then 2008 happened. There was the worldwide recession and we went down to $9 milk,” he told Wisconsin State Farmer.

The dairy farm, Roecker's Rolling Acres, is run by Roecker, his daughter and son-in-law, and Rocker's parents. Together they milk 275 cows and run 750 acres.

His parents in their 80s didn’t know how to handle their son’s depression. “Dad said ‘go do your chores’ and I did.

Roecker says he was hospitalized three times for depression. Over a period of about seven years he battled it with therapy and antidepressant medications.

""Pretty soon I had a virtual cocktail of drugs in my medicine cabinet.”

He overdosed a couple of times on those drugs – not entirely wanting to kill himself, but using the “farmer logic” that if a little was good then more would be better. “One thing about a lot of those drugs is that they may treat you for depression but the side effect can be suicidal thoughts. And it’s true. My parents made sure to take all the guns away,"" Roecker said.

Farmer’s low point

“My low point was visualizing my funeral with my family standing by my casket.” That was when he decided to help himself. He took himself off all his meds and threw himself into his farm work with all the willpower he could muster.

Early in his battle with depression, Roecker says he could not even make himself walk or shave or comb his hair. Looking back at photos from that period Roecker and his parents can see how much he was affected by the depression mirrored in his troubled eyes.

To this day Roecker still doesn’t know how he beat depression but has managed to climb up out of the hole he had been in. Then, in 2018, a neighboring dairy farmer, Leon Statz, killed himself after a long battle with depression. That took Roecker back to the toughest days of his own depression.

He felt moved to put on meetings for other farmers to talk about depression and mental health with Brenda Statz, Leon’s widow, and others in his area who felt it was important to get farmers to talk about these issues.

That led to the formation of the Farmer Angel Network, which was highlighted at the meeting in Arlington. “We do different things around the county, bringing light to this subject,” he said. “It shouldn’t be hidden. It’s okay to talk about it.”

Seymour area farmer and Wisconsin Farmers Union President Rick Adamski admitted to attendees that he also struggled with depression for many years as he operated a family farm with all the stressors that entails.

Roecker says he didn’t set out to become the poster boy for farmer mental health, but somewhere along his journey decided that if other farmers saw him talking about it, they might feel okay voicing their own struggles with depression.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)

(RNS) — At least one red state is already making room, it seems, for women to successfully make a free exercise claim.

(RNS) — Thirty years ago, when a broad religious coalition was coming together to counteract Employment Division v. Smith, a 1990 Supreme Court decision limiting religious free exercise claims, the Catholic bishops conference held back.

Sure, its lawyers reasoned, religious freedom is a good thing. But what happens if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade? Wouldn’t returning to the religious freedom standard before Smith enable some women to assert a free exercise right to obtain an abortion?

Eventually, the bishops did join the coalition and in 1993 the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, known as RFRA, sailed through an almost unanimous Congress. But if Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization proves to be the real deal and abortion ceases to be a constitutional right, there’s good reason to think women will indeed advance free exercise claims against new state laws forbidding or severely limiting their ability to obtain an abortion.





Take Judaism, which is generally more permissive of abortion than a number of such laws, to say nothing of the outright bans that could well be coming down the pike.

RELATED: The Christian right’s abortion policy isn’t in my Torah

“Judaism allows & requires abortion in many circumstances,” tweeted Blimi Marcus, an Orthodox Jewish nurse practitioner and professor, shortly after Politico leaked Alito’s draft. “The mother’s well-being takes priority over a fetus, acc to Jewish law. A fetus which harms a woman is termed a murderer.”

She continued, “An overturned Roe will result in Jewish women everywhere being unable to practice their religion,” adding by way of clarification, “Jewish women in red states.”

Some of the red-state anti-abortion laws show an awareness of this free exercise issue — and even allow for it to prevail. For example, Oklahoma’s new fetal heartbeat bill, which bans all abortions after six weeks except when the pregnant person’s life is threatened, contains the following language: “Nothing in this act shall be construed to: 1. Authorize any government entity to substantially burden any religious belief … “

Evidently, pregnant Jewish women who claim that their religious belief is substantially burdened by the law will be able to obtain an abortion in Oklahoma.

To be sure, not all states that ban abortions include such religious carve-outs. In such cases, would a Jewish woman (or another woman who asserts a comparable religious burden) be able to gain a free exercise right to abortion from the federal courts?





Who knows?

In Boerne v. Flores (1997), the Supreme Court declared that RFRA does not apply to the states, so any neutral, generally applicable state law remains proof against a federal free exercise claim. And even in the absence of Smith, the court, in its current configuration, could well find that the state in question had a “compelling interest” in protecting fetuses.

On the other hand, no Supreme Court in history has been so attached to promoting the free exercise of religion as this one. If religious liberty is allowed to trump public health, why not fetal life?",Q2

One of the greatest naturalists of the 19th century, Robert Kennicott, or rather his skeleton, is on display at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington. His heart, however, remains always with The Grove, his family home in Glenview.

It rests in a grave along with his other organs, tissue and hair, says Lorin Ottlinger, director of The Grove National Historic Landmark, a facility of the Glenview Park District. The story of Kennicott's amazing life and mysterious death will be part of a new exhibit, which will include a replica of his skeleton, expected to open next year at The Grove with help from an Illinois Department of Natural Resources' $375,000 Public Museum Grant.

After his mysterious death in 1866, Kennicott's body had nearly as many adventures and travels as the groundbreaking naturalist did during his short life.

Glenview's Robert Kennicott was an acclaimed 19th Century naturalist who sent many specimens to the Smithsonian Institution. His skeleton is on display in the National Museum of Natural History. Courtesy of Chip Clark/Smithsonian Institution

Born in New Orleans on Nov. 13, 1835, Kennicott grew up in Glenview, where his parents, John and Mary Kennicott, built a simple log cabin in 1836. A larger house, which has been restored to its original appearance and used for tour groups, was built in 1856.

“This whole site is a National Historic Landmark because of the Kennicott family,” Ottlinger says of the home rising above a prairie amid hickory and oak trees. In the 1970s, developers were eyeing the property for new construction when “a group of ladies stepped in front of bulldozers to save this place,” Ottlinger says. Hoping to belittle their efforts, critics called the activists “The Frog and Fern Ladies.” But those women embraced that title, saved the land and eventually became what is now The Grove Heritage Association.

The Kennicotts' influence spread across the suburbs, and their name can be found on street signs and at the Kennicott Brothers florists in Northbrook.

One of seven children, Robert Kennicott stored so many plant and animal specimens in jars on his bedroom shelves that there was no room for a bed, forcing him to bunk in his brother's bedroom. But from his bedroom, he could hear the chorus frogs and booming prairie chickens, and watch the majestic sandhill cranes. Influenced by his father, a medical doctor and horticulturist, the young Kennicott began collecting specimens as a boy, even sending some to the newly formed Smithsonian Institution.

Mark Welsh/mwelsh@dailyherald.com The life and death of acclaimed naturalist Robert Kennicott will be part of a new exhibit coming to The Grove National Historic Landmark in Glenview, says Lorin Ottlinger, director of the outdoor history and nature museum built on Kennicotts' boyhood homestead.

“Robert Kennicott was Illinois' first naturalist. He collected more specimens than anyone,” Ottlinger says. The specimens collected by Kennicott on display at the Smithsonian include a stripetail darter fish known by the scientific name of etheostoma kennicotti, and a whitefish given the name coregonus kennicotti. Alaska has a town, river and glacier named in his honor.

“Robert was a special person, and somewhat emblematic of curators at the Smithsonian even today, because he was so dedicated to his work. It was not necessarily a job but a way of life that began when he was just a child, and continues until his death at age 30,” Kari Bruwelheide, a physical and forensic anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, says in a paper about Kennicott.

Mark Welsh/mwelsh@dailyherald.com The bedroom in this 1856 home of famed naturalist Robert Kennicott was stuffed with so many plant and animal specimens he collected that he had to bunk with a brother in another room.

After co-founding the Chicago Academy of Sciences (now the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum) in 1857, Kennicott moved to Washington, where he lived in the Smithsonian Castle. His collection at the Chicago Academy of Sciences burned in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but the rocks he collected are on display at The Grove. Kennicott also was an original member and co-creator of the Megatherium Club, named after an extinct giant sloth, which was a group of eccentric young naturalists who built the Smithsonian's collection.

It was during an expedition to Russian America (now Alaska) that Kennicott was found dead on the banks of the Yukon River on May 13, 1866. “His body was found lying there with his compass at his side,” Ottlinger says.

Mark Welsh/mwelsh@dailyherald.com This cast-iron coffin once featured a glass window so people could see the face of naturalist Robert Kennicott. Lorin Ottlinger, director of The Grove National Historic Landmark in Glenview, says a new exhibit will explore Kennicott's mysterious death and the odyssey of his remains.

There was speculation that he was murdered, killed himself or died from accidental poisoning from the mercury he took to treat his depression, or from the strychnine and arsenic he used to preserve specimens. It took 261 days to return his body to The Grove, Ottlinger says.

The cast-iron coffin that held his body will be part of the new exhibit, which will show that “there's so much you can learn from reading the bones,” Ottlinger says. “Knowing what a prolific scientist he was, he would have wanted that.”",Q2

Bode, who went viral for calling out racism, told the couple to get out of his car after the ""completely inappropriate"" comment.

The male passenger then became angry, calling Bode an ""a******,"" and saying he should ""punch him in the face.""

""You're gonna threaten me with assault?"" Bode asked. ""Cause you guys are racist *****.""

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/how-a-murky-mission-and-partisan-reputation-doomed-the-dhs-disinformation-board,How a murky mission and partisan reputation doomed the DHS disinformation board,"

News that the 3-week-old Disinformation Governance Board appears to be shutting down came as no surprise to its supporters or its detractors, who saw an agency that launched without a clear direction and quickly became a pinata for critics.

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas announced the board during a congressional hearing April 27, setting off a firestorm of events that included fierce questioning of the new agency and its stated mission.

TRUMP-ERA DHS LEADERS DISPUTE WHITE HOUSE TYING THEM TO DISINFORMATION BOARD

“The board has been grossly and intentionally mischaracterized: it was never about censorship or policing speech in any manner,” reads a statement from an unnamed spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. “It was designed to ensure we fulfill our mission to protect the homeland, while protecting core constitutional rights. However, false attacks have become a significant distraction from the department’s vitally important work to combat disinformation that threatens the safety and security of the American people.”

Mayorkas verbally announced the board’s formation during the hearing, but DHS never issued a press release about the group, and department leaders were mostly averse to speaking about it afterward. According to the Washington Post, even Executive Director Nina Jankowicz was told not to talk about the board publicly. Jankowicz resigned from her position Wednesday.

Criticisms of Jankowicz included her history of making misleading statements, such as those regarding British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s discredited Trump-Russia dossier, and downplaying controversy embroiling President Joe Biden’s son. A former disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center and adviser to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, much of Jankowicz’s career has focused on domestic disinformation rather than foreign threats.

The board was lampooned as an inappropriate government foray into free speech, with many comparing it to the Ministry of Truth from George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984. A group of 175 House Republicans sent a letter to Mayorkas earlier this month demanding more information about the disinformation board.

Blowback came swiftly following the initial announcement, and it was never made entirely clear what the board’s purpose was. DHS eventually issued a fact sheet but did not directly answer follow-up questions from the Washington Examiner.

Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the board was the continuation of Trump-era DHS initiatives, a claim the agency’s leaders from the period disputed. Chad Wolf, formerly the department’s acting secretary, applauded the board’s demise.

“I’m glad to see that DHS is stepping back from this terrible idea, but I’m still unnerved by the fact that anybody within DHS or the Biden administration would have thought to green light it in the first place,” Wolf said.

For many, the board morphed into a punch line for criticism of the Biden administration. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, joked that the board should review a Biden tweet he disagreed with.

Some conservatives also questioned DHS’s statement that mischaracterizations of the board led to its demise.

“Oddly, this Disinformation Governance Board was supposed to be powerful enough to combat foreign operatives and global disinformation campaigns,” said Jenny Beth Martin, honorary chairwoman of Tea Party Patriots Action. “For three weeks, the Biden administration has scolded us that this was all about foreign disinformation. But some domestic ridicule shut it down? Really?”

It remains unclear if the board is being totally dissolved or if it might return in some other form. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during Wednesday’s press briefing that the board has never convened and that former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick will do an “assessment.”

At the same time, she said work to address disinformation against national security will continue.

“Neither Jankowicz nor the board have anything to do with censorship or with removing content from anywhere,” she said. “Their role is to ensure that national security officials are updated on how misinformation is affecting the threat environment. [Jankowicz] has strong credentials and a history of calling out misinformation from both the Left and the Right.”

The review process is supposed to be completed within 75 days, during which time the board will not meet. The White House was not involved in the decision to initiate the pause, Jean-Pierre added.

It’s an uneven landing for the board, says Cato Institute policy analyst Will Duffield, but perhaps an appropriate one given its tangled history.

“It seems like sort of an awkward shutdown,” Duffield said. “But then, it was launched awkwardly too.”",Q2

Mick Mulvaney, Trump's former acting chief of staff, on Cassidy Hutchinson: “I know her. I don’t think she is lying.”

Mick Mulvaney – the acting chief of staff under former Pres. Donald Trump from Jan. 2019 to March 2020 – tweeted during the committee hearing that there was “no one closer” to Trump than special assistant to the Chief of Staff Cassidy Hutchinson.

He said that as a top aide, Hutchinson would be covered by the same “executive privilege” as former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows or Assistant to the President Peter Navarro, and that “If she can testify, then so can they.”

Mulvaney said he expected to hear from former Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Tony Ornato, former Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel and Meadows before the hearings were concluded.

Thompson: 'Serious discussion' about Cipollone being interviewed or testifying

Select Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., told reporters that former special assistant to the chief of staff Cassidy Hutchinson had four separate interviews before testifying because “the legal advice she was receiving didn’t allow her to be as forthcoming as we thought.""

Once Hutchinson changed attorneys – from the Trump White House chief ethics lawyer to Jody Hunt, a longtime ally of former Trump administration Attorney General Jeff Sessions – ""she began to open up more and more about what was happening around January 6,” Thompson said.

Following Hutchinson’s testimony on Tuesday, Thompson said he expected there would be “serious discussion” in the committee about inviting former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to be interviewed or testify.

Hutchinson repeatedly mentioned Cipollone as one of the most outspoken in Trump’s inner circle, imploring Trump to speak out against the rioters on both Jan. 6 and 7.

Raskin: Committee will look into witness tampering

Speaking to reporters after the hearing, U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, R-Md, said the Jan. 6 committee looks to investigate further into tampering of witnesses, after two witnesses told the committee they had been pressured into testifying in favor of former President Donald Trump.

“It's a crime to tamper with witnesses, it’s a form of obstructing justice,” Raskin said. “The committee won't tolerate it and we haven’t had a chance to fully investigate it or fully discuss it, but it's something we want to look into.”

As for looking into potential crimes – either tampering or by others involved in the Jan. 6 attack – Raskin said that falls under the Justice Department’s jurisdiction.

He said the committee plans to release a list of recommendations following the end of the hearings about how to “safeguard the integrity of our government and how to make sure that elections don't come under attack.”

Witnesses sitting for depositions in front of the Jan. 6 committee have received calls from former colleagues advising them about how they should testify before the committee, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said Tuesday, saying the practice raises “very serious concerns.""

One witness described a caller talking about “protecting who I need to protect” and being a “team player,” according to written text of the exchange with the unnamed witness shared by the committee Tuesday. “They have reminded me a couple of times that Trump does read transcripts and just to keep that in mind as I proceed with my interviews.”

Another witness testified, “[A person] let me know you have your deposition tomorrow. He wants me to let you nkoow that he’s thinking about you. He knows you’re loyal, and you’re going to do the right thing when you go in for your deposition,” according to the committee.

Trump urged to condemn Jan. 6 attack over concerns of 25th Amendment

Trump was extremely reluctant to release a statement condemning the Capitol attack the day after Jan. 6. Former aide to Mark Meadows, Cassidy Hutchinson, told the committee a group of White House staffers had to convince him to give a speech.

“Mark (Meadows), Ivanka (Trump), Jared Kushner, Eric Herschmann, Pat Cipollone, Pat Philbin, those are people I’m aware of,” said Hutchinson, recalling who was in the group that convinced Trump. “Kayleigh McEnany as well.”

There was genuine concern in the White House over the 25th Amendment being invoked and removing Trump as president, which was part of how Trump was convinced to give a speech.

Giuliani and Meadows both wanted presidential pardons related to Jan. 6

Former chief of staff Mark Meadows and President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani both sought pardons from Trump in relation to Jan. 6, said Cassidy Hutchinson, former assistant to Meadows.

The two are the latest in a growing list of Trump allies who Hutchinson knew sought pardons.

In last week’s hearing, Hutchinson testified that GOP lawmakers Mo Brooks, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, Louie Gohmert and Scott Perry all sought pardons as well.

Cheney: People spoke of invoking the 25th Amendment against Trump

Hutchinson and Cheney discussed post-Jan. 6 talk from prominent officials about invoking the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution against Trump, removing him from office for incapacity.

The 25th Amendment was ""a way of stripping the full power of the presidency from Donald Trump,"" Cheney said.

Hutchinson said officials discussed the amendment as a way to give themselves ""cover"" for their own actions. No one followed through on the 25th Amendment idea.

Instead, the U.S. House voted to impeach Trump for a second time.

Fox News host and Trump Jr. texted Meadows

Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Donald Trump Jr. texted chief of staff Mark Meadows on the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021 saying that the president needed to condemn the violence taking place at the Capitol.

“Hey mark, the president needs to tell people in the capitol to go home,” Ingraham wrote at the beginning of a series of three tweets. “This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy and playing into every stereotype. We lose all credibility against the BLM/antifa crowd if things go south.”

“He’s got to condemn this sh—,” Trump Jr. texted. “Asap. The capitol police tweet is not enough.”

Ivanka Trump wanted her father to send people home

Ivanka Trump said on multiple occasions on Jan. 6 that she wanted her father to implore rioters to go home, following the same advice of White House counsel urging former President Donald Trump to take “swift action.”

“She wanted her dad to tell them to go home peacefully and she wanted to include language that he necessarily wasn’t on board with at the time,” former special assistant Cassidy Hutchinson said.

Hutchinson 'disgusted' at Trump's attack on Pence

Hutchinson said that, as a staff member, she was disappointed at a Trump tweet on Jan. 6 attacking Vice President Mike Pence, even as he was under threat of death by Trump rioters. Outside of her job, Hutchinson said she had a different reaction

""As an American, I was disgusted,"" Hutchinson said. ""It was unpatriotic. It was un-American.""

She said Pence and the Capitol were under attack over a Trump lie about election fraud.

‘I read that tweet and made a decision at that moment to resign’

Former Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger told the committee he made the immediate decision to resign after seeing Trump’s tweet that former Vice President Mike Pence didn’t have the “courage” to overturn the election.

On the day of the Capitol attack, as rioters breached the Capitol, a member of Pottinger’s staff handed him a printout of Trump’s tweet.

“I read that tweet and made a decision at that moment to resign,” said Pottinger. “That’s where I knew I was leaving that day, once I had read that tweet.”

‘He doesn’t think they’re doing anything wrong,’ chief of staff said of Trump on threats to Pence

Hutchinson said she overheard Trump, Mark Meadows and Trump lawyers in the White House discuss the chants of “Hang Mike Pence” as rioters attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6.

She recalled Trump White House attorney Pat Cipollone telling Meadows, “We need to do something.”

“You heard it, Pat,” Meadows said, according to Hutchinson. “He thinks Mike deserves that. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong. To which Pat said something to the effect of, 'This is f---ing crazy.'""

Meadows: Trump ‘doesn’t want to do anything’ about violence at Capitol

Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told White House lawyer Pat Cipollone on Jan. 6, 2021, that President Donald Trump didn’t want to do anything to stop the violence that was taking place at the Capitol, according to Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony.

Cipollone came “barrelling toward our office,” Hutchinson said, before opening the door, shaking his head, and telling Meadows that the rioters had made it to the Capitol. He urged Meadows to come with him to go speak to Trump.

“He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat,” Hutchinson said Meadows said, and Hutchinson says Cipollone responded, “Mark, something needs to be done. People are going to die and the blood is going to be on your f---ing hands. This is out of control. I’m going down there.”

Hutchinson: Meadows 'needs to snap out of this'

When Cassidy Hutchinson, former special assistant to ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, saw the rioters were getting closer to the Capitol, she went into Meadows’ office to see if he was aware of what’s going on.

She found him “sitting on his couch on his cellphone,” not paying attention to the news.

Hutchinson said seeing the rioters get closer felt like watching “a bad car accident that’s about to happen where you can’t stop it, but you want to be able to do something.”

“I remember thinking in that moment, “Mark needs to snap out of this, and I don’t know how to snap him out of this, but he needs to care,” Hutchinson said.

Flynn took the 5th when asked about peaceful transitions of power

Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows spoke with Roger Stone and Michael Flynn the night before the Capitol attack “regarding what would play out the next day,” according to Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Hutchinson confirmed to the committee that Meadows spoke with both Stone and Flynn, but was “not sure” the exact contents of the conversations.

Stone was at the Capitol attack and had “multiple members of the Oathkeepers who were allegedly serving as his security detail,” said Cheney. In deposition to the committee, Flynn exercised his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked if violence at the Capitol was justified.

Trump reacts to witness Cassidy Hutchinson, claims he barely knew her

The former president issued a number of statements during the hearing attacking Hutchinson.

""I hardly know who this person, Cassidy Hutchinson, is, other than I heard very negative things about her,"" Trump said in a post on the Truth Social website.

In an initial statement, Trump did not address any specifics of Hutchinson's testimony. They included statements that he knew Jan. 6 protesters had weapons and that he lunged at a Secret Service agent in an effort to grab the steering wheel of the presidential SUV to drive to the U.S. Capitol.

In subsequent posts, Trump denied wanting to see protesters with weapons or trying to grab the wheel of his vehicle.

Said Trump: ""She is bad news!""

Note: Other Trump White House aides of Jan. 6 issued statements during the day defending Hutchinson, and praising her testimony.

Alyssa Farah Griffin defends Cassidy Hutchinson

A conservative commentator who previously worked as an assistant to President Donald Trump defended Cassidy Hutchinson, the former principal aide to chief of staff Mark Meadows who is testifying in front of the Jan. 6 committee.

“People of sound mind don’t reach to try to grab a steering wheel, from the backseat, to drive to the Capitol to overturn a democratic election,” Farah Griffin tweeted, referencing Hutchinson’s testimony about Trump’s behavior that day.

“Cassidy Hutchinson is 25 years old and has more courage than many elected members of Congress more than twice her age,” she also wrote.

Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego: Trump 'had insurrection on his mind'

“Like a lot of insurrection leaders, he knew his insurgents, and he knew how to motivate them,” Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., told reporters during the hearing recess.

“There's no such thing as this many coincidences in life. The fact that the Oathkeepers, the Proud Boys, they all showed up. They all had weaponry, that they happened to stick outside the magnetometers, the fact that he knew that they weren't dangerous,” Gallego said.

“The fact that he was trying to get to the Capitol to basically lead them into the Capitol, you know, tells you that this president had insurrection on his mind, was trying to interfere with Congress's duty to certify the election,” Gallego said. “The question is, what happens next and where is (Attorney General) Merrick Garland in all of this?”

Angry Trump threw lunch against the wall after Barr announced there was no voter fraud

Furious after Attorney General Bill Barr announced he found no evidence of widespread voter fraud to the Associated Press, Trump threw his lunch against the wall, according to Hutchinson.

Hutchinson said she saw a broken porcelain plate in the White House dining room following the Dec. 20, 2020, incident and ""ketchup dripping down the wall.""

“The valet had articulated that the president was extremely angry at the Attorney General's AP interview and had thrown his lunch against the wall,” Hutchinson said.

Such tantrums were not uncommon by Trump, she said.

“There were several times throughout my tenure with the chief of staff that I was aware of either him throwing dishes or flipping the tablecloth to let all the contents of the table go onto the floor and likely break or go everywhere,” Hutchinson said.

Trump grabbed steering wheel, lunged at aide

Former President Donald Trump was under the impression he was heading to the Capitol following his rally.

""I'm the f---ing president. Take me to the Capitol now,"" Trump said, according to Hutchinson.

When he was told he wasn't going, Trump, sitting in the back of his SUV in the motorcade, reached forward and tried to grab the steering wheel in order to move the vehicle in the direction of the Capitol, even though aides said he had to go back to the White House. He later lunged at his security chief in an apparent attempt to choke him.

Hutchinson said she heard this story in the White House from Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato. She said Trump’s security chief Robert Engel, who had been in the car with Trump, was in the room with them. At no point did Engel correct the story, Hutchinson said.

“Mr. Engel grabbed his arm, said, ‘Sir, you need to take your arm off the steering wheel,’” Hutchinson testified. “’We’re going back to the West Wing. We’re not going to the Capitol.’ Mr Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel and when Mr. Ornato recounted this story for me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.”

She also said that White House lawyer Pat Cipollone warned her that if Trump went to the Capitol to follow his supporters on Jan.6, they ""would be charged with every crime.""

Hutchinson: White House counsel warns of Trump being charged if he marched on Capitol

Hutchinson, an aide to former President Donald Trump, said White House counsel Pat Cipollone voiced concerns repeatedly about Trump’s plan to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as potentially illegal.

“Please make sure we don’t go up to the Capitol, Cassidy,” Hutchinson quoted Cipollone as telling her the morning of Jan. 6. “Keep in touch with me. We’re going to get charged with every crime imaginable if we make that movement happen.”

Trump never walked to the Capitol. But he said he would during his speech on the Ellipse that morning. Cipollone warned Hutchinson that Trump could be charged with obstructing justice or defrauding the count of Electoral College ballots if he did that.

“We need to make sure that this doesn’t happen,” Hutchinson quoted Cipollone as telling her Jan. 3. “This would be legally a terrible idea for us. We have serious legal concerns if we go up to the Capitol that day.”

Trump wanted to go to the Capitol with Jan. 6 protesters

Multiple White House aides told the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack that Trump wanted to accompany the Jan. 6 rally attendees on their march to the Capitol.

Max Miller, former White House aide, said Trump had a desire to drive down to the Capitol after his speech “came up” in conversation.

“He brought it up. He said ‘I wanted to go down to the Capitol.’”

Another former White House aide, Nick Luna, said Trump wanted to “march” to the Capitol with the protestors. “I was aware of the desire of the president to potentially march, or accompany the rally attendees to the Capitol.”

– Kenneth Tran

Hutchinson: Trump's lawyers were concerned he was inciting a riot

Hutchinson told the committee that White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and other lawyers stressed to Trump and aides that marching to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, could expose him to a number of criminal charges – including inciting a riot.

It would look like ""we were inciting a riot or were encouraging a riot,"" Hutchinson recalled the White House counsel saying.

A riot is exactly what happened when Trump's supporters showed up at the Capitol after Trump's fiery rally speech.

Other potential charges included obstruction of justice and defrauding the electoral vote count, Hutchinson said in quoting White House lawyers.

– David Jackson

Trump attorneys worried about legal ramifications of Trump’s speech on Jan. 6

Hutchinson said Trump lawyers had “many discussions” on the morning of Jan. 6 about their concerns of what Trump planned to say in his speech outside the White House.

Eric Herschmann, one of the attorneys, said Trump would be “foolish” to include language that the president requested in which the president would say, “We're gonna march the Capitol. I'll be there with you. Fight for me. Fight for what we're doing. Fight for the movement.”

Later, Trump attorney Pat Cipollone said it would be a “legally terrible idea for us” if Trump followed through and marched to the Capitol while Congress counted electoral votes.

Meadows had 'lack of reaction' to violence at the Capitol

Hutchinson, principal aide to chief of staff Mark Meadows, said she tried repeatedly to tell Meadows about violence at the Capitol while Capitol Police were being overrun by attackers.

A couple of times before she was able to tell him, she opened a door to a car he was in, and he closed it. She said a backlog of information she needed to relay to him built up. When she was finally able to pass on information about violence at the Capitol, she said he barely reacted.

“He almost had a lack of reaction,” Hutchinson said. “I remember him saying, ‘All right,’ something to the effect of, ‘How much longer does the president have left in his speech?’”

– Erin Mansfield

Despite threat of violence, Trump was 'furious' there was extra space at Ellipse

In text messages between former Deputy Chief of Staff Anthony Ornado and former aide to Mark Meadows, Cassidy Hutchinson, Trump was “f—ing furious,” at there being extra space at the Ellipse prior to the Capitol attack.

“He was furious because he wanted the area that we had on the Ellipse to be maxed out at capacity for all attendees.” Trump was told that everyone who wanted to attend was already there, but Hutchinson said he was still angry.

When looking at photos of the crowd, Trump was “very concerned about the shot, meaning the photograph that we would get because the rally space wasn’t full.”

– Kenneth Tran

Rally attendees had weapons

Meadows stared at phone while told about weapons on Jan. 6

Hutchinson said Meadows did not look up from his phone when Tony Ornato, White House deputy chief of staff of operations, informed him that rioters who were gathered for a Trump rally outside the White House on Jan. 6 had weapons.

She recalled Meadows remained looking down at this phone for a few seconds. He then asked her what she was hearing.

“And I looked at Tony and I was like, ‘Sorry, I just told you about what was happening.'""

Trump supporters with weapons later made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol.

Trump didn't 'care that they have weapons. They’re not here to hurt me'

In the backstage area of Trump’s rally held on Jan. 6, Hutchinson overheard Trump tell staff that he didn’t care whether people had weapons, to let them into the rally area because “they’re not here to hurt me.”

Hutchinson said Trump was upset at the size of his rally crowd and was primarily angry that staff wasn’t letting through his supporters that were carrying weapons.

“Let the people in, take the f–ing mags away,” Trump said, referring to magnetrometers, or metal detectors.

Hutchinson: Security chief briefed Trump about weapons in Ellipse crowd

Hutchinson said the deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato, notified Trump before 10 a.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, about people on the Ellipse carrying weapons including flagpoles, sticks, spears, knives and guns including pistols and rifles.

Former chief of staff Mark Meadows didn’t react to his own briefing by Ornato. But then he looked up and said, ‘Have you talked to the president?’” according to Hutchinson. “Tony said, ‘Yes, sir. He’s aware too.’ He said, ‘All right, good.’”

The vice chair of the committee, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., asked Hutchinson to reinforce that Ornato had briefed the president about weapons at the location where he was about to give a speech.

“That’s what Mr. Ornato relayed to me,” Hutchinson said.

Police saw men with rifles, handguns hiding in trees near Trump’s rally

On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, police said there were men within walking distance of the ellipse armed with AR-15-style rifles and Glock-style pistols. Some hid out in trees.

In radio communication played by the Jan. 6 committee Tuesday, police said two complainants saw the stock of an AR-15 under one man’s jacket. Another police officer described three men in fatigues walking with AR-15 rifles.

“Look for the don’t tread on me flag,” one officer said describing a man in a tree. “American flag face mask. Cowboy boots. Weapon on the right side hip.”

Aide recalled hearing 'Oathkeeper' and 'Proud Boys' during Jan. 6 planning

Cassidy Hutchinson said that while in the White House, she heard the words “Oathkeeper” and “Proud Boys” as Jan. 6 drew closer.

“I recall hearing the words ‘Oathkeeper’ and the words ‘Proud Boys,’ closer to the planning of the January 6 rally when Mr. Giuliani would be around,” said Hutchinson, in deposition to the Jan. 6 committee.

Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., also revealed that on Jan. 3, U.S. Capitol Police issued a report noting “that the Proud Boys and other groups planned to be in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6,” and that they targeted Congress rather than counter-protestors.

Hutchinson: DNI Ratcliffe considered Trump fighting election results ‘dangerous’

Hutchinson said the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, avoided involvement in the administration’s post-election agenda of fighting the results of the 2020 election.

Ratcliffe, a former Republican member of the House from Texas, thought searching for missing ballots and challenging election results in specific states would hurt former President Donald Trump’s legacy, according to Hutchinson.

“He had expressed concern that it could spiral out of control and potentially be dangerous either for our democracy or the way that things were going for the Sixth,” Hutchinson said in videotaped testimony to the committee. “He felt that there could be dangerous repercussions.”

Hutchinson: Trump and top aides knew that Jan. 6 could get dangerous

Hutchinson recounted how a number of White House officials expressed fears that the Jan. 6, 2021, election protests could get violent because of extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers - and that Trump had to know as well.

On tape, Hutchison talked about how national security adviser Robert O'Brien wanted to meet with Meadows about the potential for violence.

""I was apprehensive about the 6th,"" Hutchinson told the committee at one point.

The committee is trying to prove that Trump and his allies knew that Jan. 6 could get dangerous – yet egged on their supporters anyway.

‘Scared and nervous’ after talking to Giuliani, Meadows

Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to Mark Meadows, said she started feeling “scared and nervous” about what could happen on Jan. 6 after talking to Meadows about comments made by Rudy Giuliani.

Hutchinson relayed Giuliani’s comments to Meadows.

“He didn't look up from his phone and said something to the effect of there's a lot going on … Things might get real, real bad on January 6,” Meadows said, according to Hutchinson.

“That evening was the first moment that I remember feeling scared and nervous for what could happen on January 6,” Hutchinson said.

– Joey Garrison

Meadows told aide, ‘Things might get real, real bad’

Former President Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows told his principal aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, that “Things might get real, real bad on Jan. 6,” according to Hutchinson’s testimony on Tuesday.

Hutchinson said went to Meadows after walking Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to his car on the evening of Jan. 2, 2021, four days before the insurrection attempt. Giuliani asked her, “Cass, are you excited for the sixth?” she testified. “It’s going to be a great day.”

When Hutchinson asked Giuliani what was going to happen on Jan. 6, she says he told her, “We’re going to the Capitol. It’s going to be great. The president’s going to be there. He’s going to look powerful.” He also told her to go to Meadows: “Talk to the chief about it.”

– Erin Mansfield

Who is Cassidy Hutchinson?

Hutchinson was a special assistant to the president for legislative affairs and aide to Meadows. She told the panel she attended key meetings and often knew about meetings involving Trump and Meadows.

“Almost all, if not all, meetings Mr. Trump had, I had insight on,” Hutchinson told the panel.

Hutchinson described White House strategy sessions where lawmakers discussed how to reject electors from specific states. She said how Meadows communicated with encrypted applications such as Signal. She said Meadows burned documents in his office fireplace after meeting with Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., according to reports in The New York Times and Politico.

And Hutchinson said Meadows described Trump as speaking approvingly of rioters chanting ""Hang Mike Pence"" while ransacking the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump denied using the phrase. Meadows has defied a committee subpoena to testify, and the House cited him for contempt.

What did Hutchinson say about White House meetings with lawmakers?

Hutchinson named the lawyers and lawmakers who met repeatedly with White House officials during December to challenge electors in several states Trump lost.

She said the strategy sessions in person and by phone included Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Jody Hice of Georgia, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Debbie Lesko of Arizona and Perry.

What did Hutchinson say about fake electors?

Trump's lawyer John Eastman proposed a scheme for seven states President Joe Biden won to submit alternate sets of electors to Congress, to potentially delay certification of the results or overturn the election.

After White House officials met with advisers outside the executive branch, such as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Hutchinson said the White House counsel's office called the strategy ""not legally sound,"" according to one of her depositions.

She said the counsel office's guidance ran along the lines of: ""That's not legal, we're not putting ourselves in that line of fire"" or ""Don't raise that to Mr. Trump, it's not appropriate, and it's not a legal theory we want to entertain right now.""

What has Hutchinson said about pardons?

Hutchinson described in videotaped testimony Thursday how lawmakers who attended the meeting Dec. 21, 2020, such as Biggs, Brooks, Gaetz, Gohmert and Perry, sought pardons.

John McEntee, former director of the White House presidential personnel office, also described Trump as considering a blanket pardon. And Eric Herschmann, a former White House lawyer, said there was a general discussion of pardons for those who defended Trump.

""I guess Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks, I know, have both advocated for there'd be a blanket pardon for members involved in that meeting,"" Hutchinson said. ""Mr. Gaetz was personally pushing for a pardon, and he was doing so since early December.""

Each of the lawmakers denied wrongdoing. Biggs, Gohmert and Perry denied asking for a pardon.

Gaetz called the investigation a witch hunt. Brooks defended his pardon request by saying Democrats could abuse the judicial process by prosecuting Republicans.

What did we learn on Thursday?

Here are three highlights from the committee's last hearing on Thursday:

Trump wanted the DOJ to ""lend credibility"" to his claims of election fraud and told agency heads to ""leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,"" according to evidence.

Trump sought to replace then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen with Clark, an environmental lawyer. The committee presented a draft letter written by Clark addressed to Georgia legislative leaders which falsely alluded to possible voter fraud in key states.

A roster of GOP lawmakers, including Reps. Mo Brooks of Alabama, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Andy Biggs of Arizona, asked for presidential pardons the day after Jan. 6, 2021, according to aides.

Hutchinson: Meadows traveled to Georgia to monitor vote count

Meadows traveled Dec. 22, 2020, to Cobb County, Georgia, where he met without an appointment with Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs to visit a building where ballot signatures were being audited. Hutchinson said Meadows was visiting his son in Georgia for Christmas, so monitoring the ballot counting was convenient.

""He wanted to do more of a status check to see where they were at with things, if they had thoughts that they needed any more resources, if there was anything that the White House could do to help ease the process along,"" Hutchinson said.

Why is the panel holding this hastily called hearing?

The hearing, which was announced Monday after committee members said they wouldn't hold another until late July, will be the sixth in June.

Previous sessions featured testimony about police injuries during the riot, about former President Trump's aides telling him lost the election, and his pressure on state officials, Vice President Mike Pence and on Justice Department officials.

The chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Thursday the investigation continues and new information is pouring in.

""Those hearings have spurred an influx of new information that the committee and our investigators are working to assess,"" Thompson said.

Documentary evidence

Among the new evidence, a British documentarian provided the panel with previously unreleased recordings of exclusive interviews with Trump, his children and former Vice President Mike Pence before and after the Capitol attack.

Alex Holder said in a tweeted statement he began the project in September 2020 and hadn’t expected the recordings to be subpoenaed. His lawyer said the Trump's had no editorial control over the video.

The recordings are scheduled to be part of a three-part series to be released this summer called, “Unprecedented.”",Q2
https://www.crisismagazine.com/2022/three-cheers-for-the-pro-life-movements-political-and-legal-arms,Three Cheers for the Pro-Life Movement’s Political and Legal Arms,"You’ve heard it all. The pro-life movement is too political. It is too connected with the Republican Party. The Republicans have done nothing to advance the cause of the unborn child. Pro-lifers are fools and chumps for being so closely aligned with the do-nothing GOP. Pro-lifers, and especially Catholics, have no home in either political party. And don’t get me started on how Donald Trump has harmed the pro-life movement. This is the chatter one hears from certain quarters.

Yet here we are on the cusp of overturning the federal abortion regime. We are about to do what many thought was impossible. We owe this impending, upending victory to the entire pro-life movement—the folks saying Hail Marys in front of abortuaries, those intervening with women entering abortion clinics, those who educate the public about what abortion is. We owe it to folks who have done nothing more than send an occasional check to their favorite pro-life group.

But, most especially, on this day, we owe it to perhaps the most reviled part of the pro-life movement, that is, the political and legal arms of the movement. This will have been a victory of hearts and minds, to be sure, but most of all it will have been a victory of partisan politics and the law.

Consider the wild carom shot the political and legal arms of the movement have been tasked with. Consider the various tracks of action necessary to bring us to this moment.

First, elect a majority of the United States Senate and ensure most of them are willing to vote pro-life.

Second, elect a president, a series of them, in fact, willing to nominate judges and justices who view Constitutional interpretation in an originalist way, all the while staying clear of any kind of pro-life litmus test.

Third, you have seen the Federalist Society and others working to change legal education so that students and professors might incorporate originalism into their thinking and actions. Keep in mind that it has only been the Left who has been allowed to have an abortion litmus test for judges and justices. This is because the Left openly espouses a totally made-up Constitution.

Fourth, where the tracks come together is when there has been a nominating fight for judges and justices, ensuring they get through what has become a nasty process.

Fifth, and then on yet another track, there are those in the states who worked on electing pro-life legislators and advanced laws and therefore legal challenges that might eventually work their way through the court system to the Supreme Court.

It has been a wonderful tapestry of related action in politics—federal, state, and local, and the law.

How crazy and wonderful has been the effort that has led to being on the cusp of overturning the federal abortion regime, a regime that The New York Times said was settled with Roe in 1973. This has been a regime supported and buttressed by all the power centers of the country—the major news media, Hollywood, major corporations, rich foundations, the elite academy.

It has not been easy. In these long years, we have been betrayed. We have known all along that the GOP was not completely with us. Many in the GOP who called themselves pro-life did so only to pay lip service and get elected. But the GOP was the only game in town. The Democrats turned into the Party of Death decades ago. There has been no home for pro-lifers there.

Even the judicial path has been fraught. Do you remember the Harriet Miers fiasco? George W. Bush nominated her with the blessing of the Federalist Society. But pro-lifers blocked her, and she was replaced with Samuel Alito. She came thisclose (sic) to sitting on the Court, and we all assumed she would be a squish like Sandra Day O’Connor or a flat-out enemy like David Souter. Remember him? We have been fooled. We have been chumps. God’s fools. God’s chumps. And, for Him, we kept going.

Consider the new attacks from the right on the very idea of originalism. Members of the Newest Right, particularly Josh Hammer of Newsweek and Adrian Vermeule of Harvard, advocate a new kind of originalism because the old kind has not work. Just look at the Bostock decision drafted by Neil Gorsuch that equates transgenderism with sex. Take a look at the decision by John Roberts upholding Obamacare. It did make one wonder if the Federalist Society project was ever going to work out. Perhaps “the living Constitution” was embedded too deep into legal skulls to ever change.

In response, Hammer and Vermeule argue that we ought to look not to the Constitution but to our policy proscriptions and how these policy desires align with what they define as the “common good.” This is a theory not dissimilar to what the judicial Left has been doing since the Warren Court decades ago, the Court that kicked prayer and the Bible out of school.

And then along came the Alito draft that may overturn Roe v. Wade and, perhaps, rescue originalism. He looked back hundreds of years to see whether abortion has even been a part of our jurisprudence or the norms of our lives. Of course, it hasn’t. Abortion on demand in the Constitution was created out of whole cloth not long before Roe came to the Court. What’s more, the precedent of Roe and Casey cannot hold if the underlying arguments failed in the first place.

The entire pro-life movement, all of it, will be able to take a humble bow when Roe is swept into the wastebasket of history. But three huzzahs must be aimed at those two most despised arms of our movement, all those who have toiled in politics and all those who have worked in legal theory and education.

There must be a final tip of the hat to the most unlikely pro-lifer, Donald Trump. None of this would have happened if he had not trounced Hillary Clinton. I don’t think Jeb Bush or any of the others could have whipped her. Once elected, this man acted in the most pro-life ways. We were astonished. Maybe a Jeb Bush would have stood by Kavanaugh when he was under withering assault. Maybe not. The fact is, Donald Trump beat Hillary. He nominated pro-life justices, and he stood by them. And he did all this while under continuous criminal attack from the Deep State. Our joy and thanks must extend to him.

Three cheers. Hip hip hooray. Hip hip hooray. Hip hip hooray.

The accident that involved Sytch, who went by the name Sunny during her active years in WWE, reportedly occurred on March 25 at U.S. Highway 1 in Volusia County, per TMZ Sports.

According to The Daily Mail, the 49-year-old former WWE wrestler was not charged by the authorities. However, officials from Ormond Beach Police noted that Sytch crashed her 2012 Mercedes into the rear of a 2013 Kia Sorento.

Reports noted that a third car was also involved in the collision, but its passenger did not require medical attention for their injuries. TMZ noted that the car was a 2011 GMC Yukon, and the passengers of the said vehicle complained of injuries in their neck, side, back, and head.

Ormond Beach Observer reported that the passenger of the 2013 Kia Sorento was identified as Julian Lafrancis Lasseter from Daytona Beach Florida.

The said Florida man was reportedly transferred to Halifax Health Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

""Our hearts go out to the Lasseter family that lost their loved one in such a tragic event,"" Ormond Beach Police Chief Jesse Godfrey said.

Officers reported that the WWE Hall of Famer was also transported to the same hospital where the Florida man was transported. However, officials did not specify the injuries the former wrestler sustained.

WWE Hall of Famer Tammy Sytch Florida Accident

Florida cops mentioned two witnesses of the crash, claiming that Sytch had been ""driving at a high rate of speed"" before hitting the 2013 Kia driven by the deceased Florida man.

The Kia Sorento had been stopped at a spotlight. But after the Sytch's car crashed in its rear, the said vehicle then crashed into the 2011 GMC Yukon that was also stopped at the stoplight.

In the police documents, authorities believed that Sytch was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash.

Authorities then took a blood sample from Sytch, according to The Daily Mail. However, the results of the said test were not yet released.

The Ormond Beach Police Department (OBPD) then assured us that they are actively investigating the fatal crash that involved the WWE Hall of Famer.

""The investigation may lead to criminal charges, which are pending toxicology results,"" the authorities said in a statement.

Reports also claimed that the OBPD also requested an expedited timeframe for the processing of the samples.

The results will be made available as soon as the department received them.

WWE Hall Of Famer Tammy Sytch Other Violations

It was not the first time that Tammy Sytch was caught in a violation in connection to car crashes.

The Daily mail stressed that the WWE Hall of Famer had at least six SWI arrests, including a 2019 charge in New Jersey for driving the wrong way on a one-way street.

The former wrestler was also arrested five times in less than a month in 2012 for a variety of charges. Charges Sytch encountered during that time included disorderly conduct and third-degree burglary.

This year, the WWE Hall of Famer was also arrested for trying to stab a lover using a pair of scissors.

To stream KHOU 11 on your phone, you need the KHOU 11 app.

HOUSTON — The odds of arresting catalytic converter thieves are slim to none at Harris County’s two biggest law enforcement agencies, according to an analysis of records obtained by KHOU 11 Investigates.

Marie Featherston learned that the hard way after a thief cut the catalytic converter off her daughter’s SUV. It happened outside of their church -- of all places.

“She starts her car and my husband and I looked at each other and went ‘uh oh,” she said. “None of us suspected anything.”

Church security video showed how the thief parked right up against her daughter’s vehicle, then slithered under “like a snake” as the mother described it, to cut off the part that contains the valuable precious metals.

“He was in the parking lot from the time he entered to the time he exited for less than six minutes,” Featherston said.

In their case, the bad guy got away with the crime, and records reveal so does nearly everyone else in the Harris County Sheriff’s Office jurisdiction. From January 2021 to May 2022, 4,543 catalytic converter theft incidents were reported, but only 56 arrests were made. That’s a 1.2% clearance rate.

“That is absolutely unacceptable. I don’t know how else to say it,” Featherston said.

Major Wayne Kuhlman oversees HCSO's criminal investigations bureau.

“I’m certain that the guys know what their success rate is,” Kuhlman said. “They know they’re winning right now.”

He said a huge challenge is proving a catalytic converter is actually stolen. Most auto manufacturers do not etch the part with a VIN or vehicle identification number, to easily tie the part back to its rightful owner.

“You almost have to watch them finish the act, have it in their possession, move in on them and arrest them,” Kuhlman said.

At the Houston Police Department, investigators face the same hurdles.

“If I can't prove you have stolen property, then there are no charges,” said Sgt. Tracy Hicks with HPD’s auto theft crimes task force. “We do catch people that have a truckload of catalytic converters that we let go.”

So how many people does HPD arrest for stealing catalytic converters? Turns out, the department doesn’t exactly know. Responding to an open records request, HPD’s records division initially provided data showing 5,355 incidents reported from April 2019 to April 2022. During those three years, it identified only 20 arrests — a 0.4 % clearance rate.

Hicks disputed those numbers.

“Trust me, we've had way more than 20. I mean, we've had 20 in the last month and a half, two months,” he said.

When asked for clarification, HPD could not come up with total arrest numbers. A department spokesperson said catalytic converter theft suspects are often charged with other crimes, and HPD is unable to track those because of “coding issues with their records system.”

Regardless of the police agency, victims like Featherston said car owners continue to suffer and it’s time for a change.

“The criminals are winning, they’re the ones getting rich,” she said. “Something needs to be done.”

Earlier this month, Houston city council banned business-to-business reselling of stolen catalytic converters and now requires anyone in possession of a cut converter to show proof of ownership.

City Theatrical’s all-in-one Multiverse Studio Kit

UK - City Theatrical will demo its latest technologies on stand N-C04 at PLASA Focus Leeds 2022 at the Royal Armouries Museum.

Live demos will include the Multiverse wireless DMX/RDM 2.4GHz system, including PLASA Award for Innovation winner Multiverse Transmitter 2.4GHz, the Multiverse Studio Kit for film and video, RadioScan Spectrum Analyser, and DMXcat Multi Function Test Tool, as well as QolorFLEX 5-in-1 and HiQ High CRI LED Tape, QolorFLEX Multiverse wireless DMX/RDM Dimmers, and other City Theatrical unique lighting accessories.

In addition to its special commendation in the 2019 PLASA Awards for Innovation, the Multiverse wireless DMX/RDM system was recognised as the winner of the Live Design Award for Best Debuting Product at the 2018 and 2019 LDI Shows in the USA, for the ability of the Multiverse Transmitter 2.4GHz to broadcast up to 10 universes of DMX data while using less radio energy than other single universe wireless DMX transmitters.

City Theatrical’s Multiverse Studio Kit is an all-in-one, battery-powered wireless DMX/RDM solution that offers reliable wireless DMX functionality with greater usability, making wireless DMX easier to install and use for film and video projects. Multiverse Studio Kit features contactless charging for its six Multiverse Studio Receivers, which each contain a long-life lithium-ion polymer battery giving 20 hours of use. Each Multiverse Studio Receiver features a full four button user interface with a backlit LED display, which makes setup easy and gives feedback on system performance, as well as a DMX corded connector, which allows the external antenna to hang below the lighting fixture for improved data fidelity.

Multiverse users can plan their wireless DMX broadcast using a RadioScan Spectrum Analyser as a frequency scanner, and set universes on each receiver from their smartphones using City Theatrical’s DMXcat app, which allows them to change their wireless DMX/RDM setup from anywhere on set, whether it is a lighting fixture with a Multiverse Module inside, a lighting fixture receiving its data from a Multiverse Node, or any wired fixture downstream of those devices. The Multiverse Transmitter is Wi-Fi enabled, allowing for communication and control from tablet-based Wi-Fi lighting controllers.

The QolorFLEX LED Tape line includes 40+ high quality tape options that help lighting designers put light in places that were once thought impossible and create lighting fixtures and effects in a new and inexpensive way. At PLASA Focus Leeds, City Theatrical will be demonstrating QolorFLEX 5-in-1 LED Tapes, which are offered in RGB plus Warm White or Amber plus Cool White colours. This LED tape has a high output brightness and all LEDs are identical to create a more even illumination.

City Theatrical will also be demonstrating its QolorFLEX HiQ LED Tape, which was designed to have a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 95, making it an ideal high CRI LED tape for the needs of the film industry. Available in three types (3200K, 6000K, and 2700K to 6500K in a single chip), HiQ LED Tape offers exceptional on-camera colour rendition and the ability to match the light sources already being used on set.

QolorFLEX LED Tapes connect easily to QolorFLEX Dimmers for ultra-smooth, flicker-free dimming. City Theatrical QolorFLEX Dimmers include a family of miniature low voltage wireless dimmers with Multiverse wireless DMX/RDM connectivity, which were recognized by LDI Show Awards as Best Debuting Product Awards.

QolorFLEX 2x2.5A Multiverse Dimmers are small, low voltage, constant voltage, two-output dimmers designed to be mounted in small spaces such as props, costumes, wands, and candles. QolorFLEX 5x2.5A Multiverse Dimmers are slightly larger and can be controlled wirelessly using City Theatrical’s Multiverse or SHoW DMX Neo wireless DMX/RDM technology, or with wired DMX, and provide 20-bit PWM resolution and 8-bit or 16-bit control for extremely smooth dimming at the low end of the dimming curve.",Q2

The crash happened at approximately 3:56 p.m. when 53-year-old Wayne Grotton of Monroe lost control of his 2013 Harley-Davidson motorcycle, said Shannon Moss, public information officer for the Maine State Police. It is unclear at this time whether he was wearing a helmet.

The initial investigation by the Maine State Police shows that alcohol and “excessive speed” were involved in the crash, but no other vehicles or people were involved, Moss said.

The Kennebec County Sheriff’s Office and Waldo County Sheriff’s Office assisted in the investigation.

https://www.newdelhitimes.com/key-moments-in-blac-chynas-trial-against-kardashians/,Key moments in Blac Chyna’s trial against Kardashians,"To keep up with the Kardashians for the past two weeks, you would’ve had to spend a lot of time at a downtown Los Angeles courthouse, where they’ve been watching and testifying at a trial over a lawsuit brought against them by former reality television star Blac Chyna. In a verdict delivered Monday while defendants Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were all in New York attending the Met Gala, the Kardashians were victorious. Here’s a look at the scene, the surroundings and the case that pulled them in.

THE SETTING

The Stanley Mosk civil courthouse is among the most heavily trafficked by celebrities in the world. The famous divorces decided here alone could fill a walk of fame. Kim Kardashian appeared on video in a Mosk courtroom in February to be declared single in her ongoing divorce with Ye, and appeared here in person to finalize her divorce from previous husband Kris Humphries.

In recent years it’s been best known as home to the high drama, and colorful protests, surrounding the Britney Spears conservatorship. Keanu Reeves and Don Johnson each sat through most of civil trials they were parties to. Members of Michael Jackson’s family appeared for much of the long wrongful death case against his doctor.

Still, the courthouse has rarely seen such consistent presence from a group of such well-known stars.

THE SCENE

The Kardashian defendants had all been expected to testify in person during the trial. But many in court were surprised, and a little star struck, when all four strode in wearing business suits on the first day of jury selection, which turned into a public forum where dozens of prospective jurors got to vent their mostly negative feelings about the family. (A few proudly proclaimed their fandom.)

The women sat in the front row of the courtroom — there were too many of them to sit at the defendants’ table — for most of the trial. Kim Kardashian, who is studying law, often carried a binder and took notes.

Court security escorted the family into the courthouse through an underground parking garage. The women waited nearby in a guarded room until proceedings were about to begin, then deputies shepherded them across the hall into the courtroom. That quick walk still provided memorable moments, as when Kim Kardashian’s boyfriend, “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, greeted her with a kiss after showing up during closing arguments.

Private security guards — sharply dressed men in sportscoats with telltale earpieces — were both in the courtroom and outside it. At the midday break they brought food to the secluded room from places such as Urth Caffe, a popular LA lunch spot.

The Kardashians’ treatment is common for high-profile parties with court business, due to, as their attorney told one prospective juror, the “dark side” of fame. Some have had to get restraining orders in this courthouse due to stalkers.

But the prospective juror wasn’t entirely satisfied with that explanation, saying, “Does that mean that they need Fiji water hand-delivered to them as they sit in court?”

The courtroom with a capacity of 200 was rarely more than half full during the 11-day trial. About a dozen reporters were in the room throughout. Unlike the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial happening simultaneously in Virginia, which was televised and may have stolen some of the thunder of these proceedings, no cameras were allowed. A pair of sketch artists provided the only visuals.

THE SUIT

Chyna’s lawsuit was filed in 2017 in the aftermath of her engagement to Rob Kardashian. She originally alleged that six women from the Kardashian family had defamed her by falsely spreading word that she had physically abused him, and interfered with her contract by convincing the E! network to cancel their “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” spinoff, “Rob & Chyna.” She sought as much as $108 million.

It was the sort of inter-celebrity suit that that is usually dismissed or settled long before it gets to trial. But this one improbably survived for five years. Two defendants, Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, were dropped during that time.

THE STORIES

Kris Jenner’s two days on the stand provided drama when she testified that she feared Chyna was going to “murder” her son Rob in December of 2016. She teared up when she described being already vulnerable because Kim Kardashian had been tied up in Paris by armed robbers who stole $10 million in jewelry just a few months earlier.

Rob Kardashian, who appeared only to testify, also had a dramatic and emotional stint on the stand, in which he said that Chyna twice held a gun to his head and beat him with a metal rod.

Chyna testified that she was never violent against him, saying she had grabbed his gun playfully, and was joking around when she put a phone cord around his neck. She conceded that she had damaged a television and a gingerbread house in her anger.

Kardashian lawyer Michael G. Rhodes seized on this in his closing argument. “Who does that? A gingerbread house?” he said. “It’s the happiest thing you can put in a house.” Davidson, in the back of the courtroom, had to stifle a laugh.

Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were each on the stand only briefly, and their testimony was not especially eventful. The judge dismissed Kim Kardashian as a defendant in the defamation part of the case when he decided no violating statement had been identified.

The jury apparently did not find any of the Kardashians’ stories terribly convincing. They found on the verdict form that they had often acted in bad faith, and were not justified in what they told executives, but found that their statements hadn’t affected Chyna’s TV career or the fate of her show.

THE SAGA

The legal fight is far from over. Chyna’s lawyer says they will appeal the verdict. And a set of separate allegations against only Rob Kardashian will be heard at another trial in about a week.

Although pugs are adorable dogs, humans have bred them to be severely flat-faced, making them very likely to suffer from intense, painful health issues. They spend a lifetime of suffering unnecessarily. Breeders are still trying to run a business at the end of the day, and until the demand for these designer breeds is put to a halt through a government ban, animal welfare is at risk. Sign this petition to urge the U.S. government to ban the breeding of pugs.

In only 11 years, upwards of 1,400 thoroughbred horses have died at the Parx Racing track in Pennsylvania. These incredibly intelligent animals suffer tremendously when raced at bone-breaking speeds through racetracks all so that humans can bet money on which ones will win. For most of these animals, their lives consist of nothing but stressful travel, rigorous training, and being injected with performance-enhancing drugs and high doses of painkillers. Sign this petition to demand that Pennsylvania authorities shut down this murderous horse-racing track now!

6. Stop Subjecting Rats to Unnecessarily Cruel Suffering

Rats are consistently categorized as a “pest”, and constantly tortured and killed to be managed to keep populations lower and not threaten public health. In Norway, rats are currently subjected to horrific population control measures. Many rats are killed using poisons, which can have especially awful side effects, which include extreme hunger and thirst, vomiting, dehydration, and internal bleeding.

The fire spread to the popular Latin American restaurant, which was also home to Relief & Resource Co. A home south of the restaurants caught on fire as well. This fire comes less than one week after another devasting fire in historic downtown Holly.

As this story is still developing the exact details of the damages are not yet known, but you will see in the pictures below they do appear to be severe. Please avoid this area as fire crews work on the scene. I will keep you updated as additional information is made available.

El Topo has always been a favorite of mine. I love the food as well as the staff there. Relief & Resource Co. is another local favorite. How often do you get to go inside of a speakeasy through a Pringles machine?

Here is to hoping both businesses are able to reopen.

https://www.fayobserver.com/story/news/2022/04/15/fsu-names-former-fort-bragg-general-new-military-affairs-advisor/7316530001/,How a former general will foster relationships with Fort Bragg military community and FSU,"Retired Brig. Gen. Arnold Gordon-Bray's appreciation for historically Black colleges started when his mother graduated from Benedict College during the 1960s in South Carolina.

Decades later, the former division chief of the Joint Special Operations Command is helping foster relationships between the military community and Fayetteville State University, North Carolina’s second-oldest university and the oldest HBCU in the University of North Carolina system.

Gordon-Bray was named as FSU’s senior advisor of military affairs and the director of its Center for Defense and Homeland Security this week.

In his role as senior advisor to FSU's associate vice chancellor for military affairs, FSU Chancellor Darrell Allison said Gordon-Bray will “enhance and promote FSU’s support of the military-connected community,” a news release from the university said.

The news release said he will spearhead enrollment growth efforts at FSU’s Center for Defense and Homeland Security and promote participation of the military-connected community in certification courses offered by the school's Center for Enterprise Resource Planning and Advanced Analytics.

Allison said Gordon-Bray “has the extensive experience and knowledge that are key to supporting and growing our student military-connected programs.”

“Certainly, he understands the nuances of the role and is exceptionally positioned and prepared to lead,” Allison said in the release.

After more than 30 years of service in the Army, Gordon-Bray's last assignment was with the U.S. Africa Command.

He also served as commander of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, and helped spearhead military operations in Iraq with a brigade combat team consisting of more than 4,500 service members.

He supported Operation Iraqi Freedom during the surge of 2007 as principal advisor to the Iraqi ground forces commander and aided in transforming 35,000 Iraqis into a force of 300,000 with six divisions capable of functioning independently.

Gordon-Bray said Thursday that being part of FSU is a culmination of influences from his mother, his father-in-law's legacy and his former boss' vision.

He said his mother, Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray, always embraced the ideals of what HBCUs stand for, “to elevate people of color” and to maintain a culture of caring.

“I want to be part of that experience,” Gordon-Bray said.

As a paratrooper, Gordon-Bray said, he respected the contributions of Black service members who came before him including his late father-in-law retired 1st Sgt. Gordon J. Burke Sr. who served in the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion known as the Triple Nickles. The group was the Army's first all-Black airborne unit and the first all-Black unit integrated into the regular Army,

“Those stories and the stories of my uncles and serving with the 82nd have always kept me connected to Fayetteville,” Gordon-Bray said.

The third reason why he said he chose to be part of FSU was because his former boss’, retired Gen. James Lindsay, had a vision to “marry Fayetteville and Fort Bragg.”

“If I’m able to have any effect to support the vision and fulfill the dreams of someone attending this great HBCU, then wow,” Gordon-Bray said.

According to FSU, the appointment is part of the university’s “commitment to better serving the needs of the military-connected community,” with Allison’s Feb. 3 announcement that FSU will provide free tuition to all military-connected students this fall as an example.

Gordon-Bray said he is honored to use his knowledge and connections at Fort Bragg to be part of FSU’s vision and commitment to the military community.

He said FSU has had a role in the lives of others in the military community like retired Command Sgt. Maj. Michele Jones, an alumna of Fayetteville State University. She became the first Black woman to be the senior enlisted advisor for the Army Reserves in October 2002 and was later appointed by the Obama administration as a member of the Senior Executive Service from July 2009 to December 2012.

Charlene Austin, the wife of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is also an FSU alumna.

Gordon-Bray said Charlene Austin is proud of her FSU connection and was the second person to call to congratulate him on his latest appointment.

The first to offer congratulations was retired Maj. Gen. Al Aycock,former Fort Bragg garrison commander, deputy chief of staff for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command-Korea. Aycock earned his master's from FSU.

Gordon-Bray said he looks forward to seeing future FSU grads make history and hopes that active-duty military and dependents will take advantage of the school offering free tuition starting in the fall.

“The education that you’re receiving in a classroom with four walls is only the beginning of your growth,” he said.

Growth during college, he said, is about finding a balance with time management and growing spiritually, physically and emotionally.

Gordon-Bray said FSU’s announcement that it will pay tuition for military students and their families allows them to have opportunities to learn with others.

Though Gordon-Bray is a past deputy commander of Army Cadet Command, he said his latest role won’t be overseeing ROTC cadets, but that doesn’t mean that he isn’t willing to offer advice to cadets or to help connect them to generals and leadership at Fort Bragg.

“Other schools and other military schools have those kinds of relationships, and I want FSU to understand that it can have that kind of relationship, too,” he said.

Gordon-Bray said he hopes to cultivate relationships between former Fort Bragg military leaders and its current leaders with FSU and its military-connected students and remain relevant “with those who will lead our nation’s armies tomorrow.”

Gordon-Bray said Science, Technology, Engineering and Math learning is important because it’s about planning for jobs that don’t exist yet.

He used cyber literacy as an example, saying it should be thought of as being more than just computers; that it is in everything in our lives.

He said all students, whether military-connected or business majors, should recognize the importance of the cyber realm.

“Part of what I hope to instill in students at Fayetteville State University is to see not only the eminent STEM jobs but also the jobs STEM will create,” Gordon-Bray said.

He said that is why he is glad to be part of FSU’s Center for National Defense and Homeland Security to “elevate and bring forward” that preparation.

He views his role as augmenting the vision of education for military-connected students.

“Students who come through this university are wondering ‘What’s next and when?’” Gordon-Bray said. “My goal is to help them be able to embrace the impossible and help them literally become all that they can be and all that they want to be.”

As the center’s director, Gordon-Bray will assist in growing enrollment of military-connected students in FSU’s academic degree programs and serve as a key business development lead, connecting Department of Defense stakeholders with FSU subject matter experts, FSU said.

According to the release, Gordon-Bray brings experience that includes having a master’s in national security and strategic studies from the Naval War College in Rhode Island and having a master’s in international strategic studies from the Air War College, in Alabama.

He has also been part of national, state and community boards including the North Carolina Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and Kiwanis International Carolina District where he serves as a lieutenant governor.

His military awards and honors include the Army Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Legion of Merit (with Oak Leaf Cluster), and the Bronze Star.

https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2022/03/30/staunton-man-found-not-guilty-first-degree-murder-mead-maurice/7220185001/,Staunton man cleared of murder charge: 'I wanted to help him. I didn't want him to die.',"STAUNTON — After sitting in jail for 21 months and listening to two days worth of testimony, Daniel D. Mead, charged in a 2020 killing, was finally given a chance to tell his side of the story Wednesday in Staunton Circuit Court during day three of his trial.

Facing the possibility of life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder, a Staunton jury took more than three hours to find Mead not guilty in the killing of 28-year-old Bradley A. Maurice, a Raphine man who was stabbed at the Springhill Village Apartments.

Mead had been held in jail since his arrest in June 2020.

The soft-spoken Mead, 35, took the stand Wednesday and fielded numerous questions about the deadly encounter with Maurice, a friend of his who had been kicked out of the Valley Mission after failing a breathalyzer test at the Staunton homeless shelter.

After being contacted by Maurice's partner, on June 24, 2020, Mead picked up the couple and their three young children at Thornrose Cemetery in Staunton and took them back to his place at the Springhill Village Apartments. There, Mead said he shared one shot of alcohol with Maurice and Chasity Agee, Maurice's partner.

While at the apartment, Mead gave Maurice a job application from his employer at the time. Evidence showed Maurice listed Mead as a reference, referring to him as a ""close friend"" on the application. Mead also said he checked his lease and decided he would be able to provide Maurice a place to stay for a week.

""I just wanted to help get him back on his feet,"" he said.

Afterward, Mead settled into a video game while Agee played with one of her children. ""I later realized Brad was in the kitchen drinking,"" Mead testified.

Mead said he kept cinnamon whiskey, rum and vodka in his freezer, and said he saw Maurice drinking alcohol straight from one of the bottles. ""Copious amounts,"" he said. After putting the booze back in the freezer, Mead said Maurice grew angry.

""He acted irate,"" he said.

Mead said Maurice then began mumbling. When Mead asked him to repeat himself, Maurice told him, “You ain’t no man.”

Mead said he immediately asked Maurice to leave his apartment. He said Maurice passed him and said it appeared as if he was going to exit the residence. But Maurice, he said, quickly turned around and got in his face, threatening him.

Mead said he grabbed Maurice’s left hand while Agee held his right hand. But when Agee let go, he said Maurice punched him in the lip. His booking photo, entered as evidence, shows Mead with an abnormally large upper lip.

“I realized the situation was escalating rapidly,” he said.

Mead testified he grabbed a butterfly knife that was hidden behind a jewelry box near his front door on a bookcase, and said it was for self-defense. Mead said after he opened and closed the knife in front of Maurice, his friend's demeanor changed and he calmed down.

But when he got into the hallway just outside of the apartment, Maurice once again became irate and began yelling and making threats, Mead said, which were recorded by a bystander and played for the jury. In the recording, he tells Mead he's going to ""knock him out.""

“I was terrified,” Mead said.

Mead made it down to the parking lot and removed some of the couple’s belongings from his car. Moments later, he said Maurice emerged from the apartment and went down to the parking lot as well. There, he said Maurice started eyeing his car up and down.

Mead testified that he said, “Brad, please don’t do anything to my car.” At that point, Maurice rushed at him and Mead said he pushed him back. Mead then pulled the knife from his pocket “to try and keep him at bay,” he said.

He said Maurice approached him a second time as he held up the knife, and said he pushed him back again, not realizing he'd poked Maurice with the knife.

“The knife did not seem to threaten or bother him at all,” he said.

After a third charge, he slashed at Maurice’s chest. “I couldn’t believe he was still coming at me. I was really scared,” noted Mead, who said he’d never been in a physical altercation.

After a fourth charge, he stabbed Maurice. “We both stood there in shock,” Mead said. ""I could not believe I had stabbed one of my best friends.”

Maurice soon collapsed. Mead said he ran to his apartment, put the knife back on the bookcase and grabbed his ID because he knew authorities had already been called to the scene.

“I felt like I was on autopilot,” said Mead, who told police where to find the knife.

Maurice was pronounced dead a short time later.

Mead testified for nearly 2 ½ hours Wednesday before the defense rested its case. “I wanted to help him. I didn’t want him to die,” he said.

A defense witness, Trey Gaither, testified Wednesday he was walking his dog along the back of the apartment complex when he saw Mead and Maurice in a confrontation. He said Maurice appeared to be the aggressor and it looked like he was ""trying to provoke a fight."" Gaither didn't witness the stabbing.

Another witness, Ciara Jones, testified Tuesday that she saw Mead lean in, pullback and place something in his pocket.

Autopsy photos showed where Maurice was poked, slashed and fatally stabbed, and his blood-alcohol content was measured at.197, more than two times the legal limit to drive in Virginia. A toxicology expert testified Wednesday that Maurice's BAC was the equivalent of about 10 beers.

During closing arguments, Staunton Commonwealth's Attorney Jeff Gaines acknowledged Maurice was drunk and belligerent. ""He abused the hospitality of a good friend, but that doesn't mean he has to die and lose everything,"" the prosecutor said.

Defense attorney William Little II said Maurice was to blame, and said his client's actions were self-defense. ""That man was not stopping,"" he told the jury.

Mead and Maurice had been friends for about seven years.

""From the vey first day that I met him, I believed in his innocence and I knew I could prove it,"" said Little, who contended during the trial that Maurice ran into the blade.

""Daniel didn't stab Brad. Brad stabbed Brad,"" he said.

The jury had options to convict Mead of a lesser charge, such as second-degree murder or manslaughter, but acquitted him instead.

Staunton Chief Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Joseph Perry, who handled the case with Gaines, declined comment following the trial when asked about the jury's verdict.

https://www.hppr.org/hppr-news/2022-05-05/oklahomas-governor-just-signed-a-texas-style-abortion-ban-heres-how-it-could-affect-texas,Oklahoma’s governor just signed a Texas-style abortion ban. Here’s how it could affect Texas,"Oklahoma’s Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a Republican-backed bill modeled after Texas’ law banning abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It took effect immediately.

He already signed a bill into law last month making it a felony to perform an abortion with one exception. Another measure still making its way through that state’s legislature bans all abortions, except in certain cases like rape or incest.

This comes as the U.S. Supreme Court — which has a conservative majority — could soon overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide. An initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to Politico, which released it Monday, NPR reported .

For now, Seema Mohapatra, a visiting professor of law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said Oklahoma’s new Texas-style law won’t just affect that state’s citizens, adding that it will also impact Texans seeking to have the procedure.

“Oklahoma abortion care providers were reporting that many of their patients were Texas residents after SB 8 [Texas’ abortion law] passed, and they had an increase in the number of patients that they were seeing,” said Mohapatra. “And so, in terms of the proximity between Oklahoma and Texas, that access is now cut off as well.”

According to researchers with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project , nearly half of the Texans who traveled out of state to get an abortion between September and December 2021 obtained the procedure in Oklahoma after Senate Bill 8 took effect Sept. 1.

TxPEP’s research also showed that a large number of Texans traveled to Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico for out-of-state abortions as well. That’s an average of about 1,400 Texans per month .

The only enforcement mechanism for Texas’ law is allowing private citizens to sue anyone involved in helping someone get the procedure. Oklahoma’s new law has a similar provision.

Meanwhile, as the nation awaits a decision on Roe, Mohapatra expects more states will try to pass similar Texas-style measures as well as other bills that lessen access to abortion.

“With the leaked opinion, states are going to be even more aggressive in the kinds of anti-abortion legislation that they’re going to pass because they know that a decision is forthcoming that is going to overturn Roe. v. Wade,” said Mohapatra.

A federal appeals court recently ended a lawsuit from abortion providers seeking to overturn Texas’ abortion law by instructing a lower district to dismiss all charges.

Abortion providers, including Whole Woman’s Health and Planned Parenthood, had sued over an enforcement aspect of Texas’ six-week abortion ban.

At issue was whether Texas medical licensing officials could punish physicians who violate the law since they were the only defendants allowed to be left in the lawsuit by the U.S. Supreme Court in a December ruling. But, the Texas Supreme Court later ruled in March that those officials did not have the authority to enforce the ban.

“So, there’s no one to sue,” Mohapatra said. “There’s no kind of repercussions for that rule, and other states are seeing that and copying it.”

Meanwhile, Idaho was the first state to pass a Texas-style abortion ban, and it was signed into law by that state’s Governor in March. It was set to go into effect last month, but Idaho’s Supreme Court temporarily blocked the law as legal challenges there proceed.

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-06-04/tulsa-uvalde-shootings-put-focus-on-waiting-periods-for-gun-buyers,"Tulsa, Uvalde shootings put focus on waiting periods for gun purchases","People wait in a line to enter a gun store in Culver City in March 2020. The man who shot and killed four people this week at a Tulsa, Okla., hospital bought his AR-style semiautomatic rifle just hours before he began the killing rampage. In Oklahoma there is no waiting period requirement for the purchase of such weapons.

When he was sentenced for killing three teenagers and gravely wounding another at a house party north of Seattle, Allen Ivanov said he was sorry and that he couldn’t explain why he did it.

But he noted one factor that allowed him to carry out the shooting — “the ease of acquiring a gun.” The then-19-year-old bought the assault-style rifle a week before the attack and was so unfamiliar with the weapon that he sat in his car outside the party and studied the owner’s manual before opening fire on his ex-girlfriend and others.

That theme has repeated itself, yet again, in America’s latest spate of mass shootings — in Buffalo, N.Y.; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Okla. — which claimed 35 lives in a span of less than three weeks. It is renewing the debate over whether restrictions such as waiting periods and bans on young adults buying semiautomatic rifles could have saved lives.

“If those had been in place, it would have made a difference,” said Paul Kramer, who led a successful 2018 effort to impose a 10-day waiting period on semiautomatic rifle purchases in Washington state, as well as a ban on young adults buying such weapons, after his son Will was gravely wounded when Ivanov attacked partygoers two years earlier. “Those mass shootings would not have unfolded the way that they did, and very likely, lives would have been saved.”

Just nine states and Washington, D.C., have explicit waiting periods before people can purchase at least some types of firearms. The restrictions can give authorities more time to conduct background checks and keep impulsive, emotional people from immediately accessing weapons they might use to kill themselves or others, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

The federal government has no waiting period. A bill that passed the Democratic-led U.S. House last year would extend the review period for background checks from three days to 10, but it’s opposed by Republicans and is not part of current negotiations in the Senate over how Congress can respond to the recent massacres.

In Tulsa, authorities said the gunman who killed his surgeon, another doctor and two other people Wednesday bought an AR-style rifle just hours beforehand, as well as a handgun on May 29. The shooter, Michael Louis, 45, of Muskogee, Okla., had recently had an operation and blamed his doctor for continuing back pain.

In Uvalde, the 18-year-old shooter who killed 21 people at Robb Elementary School had purchased two rifles in the preceding week.

California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia have waiting periods for purchases of all types of weapons, ranging from three to 14 days. Minnesota and Washington impose waiting periods for handguns and semiautomatic rifles, while Maryland and New Jersey have waiting periods only for handguns.

Advertisement

In addition, several other states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Massachusetts, require buyers of at least some types of guns to obtain permits first, sometimes requiring completion of safety classes. Those restrictions can function like waiting periods.

Oklahoma has no law mandating a waiting period, but some Democratic lawmakers called for a special session of the Legislature to address it among other gun violence measures after the Tulsa shooting.

“Oklahoma students will be in school in two months,” said House Minority Leader Emily Virgin. “If we fail to act before then, it will be because the Legislature has no will to do so. That’s something that I hope all Oklahomans are paying attention to.”

They suggested a waiting period on firearms purchases, raising the state’s minimum age for purchasing weapons from 18 to 21, and a “red flag” law, allowing guns to be temporarily seized from people who might pose a danger to themselves or others. Those proposals are likely to go nowhere in a GOP-controlled Legislature that has for years pushed for loosening state gun laws instead.

Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is running for reelection, said last week after the Texas shooting that it was too soon to talk about firearms policy.

Florida stands out as a Republican-led state that imposed gun restrictions after a mass shooting. In 2018, after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland left 14 students and three staff members dead, then-Gov. Rick Scott signed legislation that included a three-day waiting period and raising the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21.

Scott, now a U.S. senator, “encourages all states to look at the action he took in Florida to determine what works best for their state,” his communications director, McKinley Lewis, said in an email Friday.

Nationally, about one-third of mass shooters purchased a gun within a month of their crimes, said James Densley, co-founder of the Violence Project, a nonpartisan research group that tracks mass shootings dating back to 1966.

According to a 2017 Harvard Business School review, laws that delay the purchase of firearms by a few days reduce gun homicides by roughly 17%. But Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, called waiting periods “an ineffective policy to try to affect gun crime.”

“The big concern we have is when people want to exercise their right to bear arms, especially when they’re a first-time gun user, they’re delayed in their ability to get the tools that they need to protect themselves,” Paredes said.

Daniel Webster, co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health, said waiting periods are important, and it’s obvious to him why more states don’t require them: Many firearm laws, he said, are “written by people who sell guns.”

Supporters say requiring a wait of a few days or more between the purchase and delivery of a gun provides an important “cooling off” time for someone who is angry or contemplating suicide.

“If you get, for whatever reason, a person who is purchasing the gun to use it to harm others, the fact that they can’t get the gun in their hands immediately may give an opportunity for the circumstances to change by the time they do get it, assuming they’re entitled to get it in the first place,” said Rhode Island Atty. Gen. Peter Neronha.

Giving law enforcement enough time to complete a thorough background check is another advantage of extending the waiting period, he said.

Hawaii has the longest waiting period in the U.S., at 14 days. Alan Beck, an attorney representing residents who are challenging various aspects of the state’s gun laws, said the two-week period seems arbitrary. If it’s meant as a cooling-off period for someone who is angry, he said it won’t have an effect on potential gun buyers if they already own a firearm.

But state Sen. Karl Rhoads said he believes the waiting period combined with other strict gun control laws have worked, noting that Hawaii has a low homicide rate.

“If you’re really angry about something and you can go buy a gun and you can get it immediately, then you may act on your impulse,” Rhoads said. “If you have to wait a couple of weeks, you may calm down and think better of it.”

Former Florida state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who represented Parkland in 2018 and is now running for Congress, said waiting periods alone aren’t enough. Raising the purchase age, adopting red flag laws, increasing mental health spending and boosting school security are all essential, he said.

“No one change is going to make a big difference,” Moskowitz said. “But every change added together is.”",Q2

The Villisca ax murders — one of the most heinous crimes in the state's history — took place overnight on June 9, 1912. It remains unsolved despite years of investigations, multiple grand jury hearings, a slander lawsuit and a murder trial, according to the Iowa Cold Cases blog.

Here's what to know about the 110-year-old cold case:

'Somebody murdered in every bed': The night of the killings

The bodies of Josiah and Sarah Moore, their four children and two visiting girls were found in the Moore home in Villisca, a Montgomery County town located about 100 miles southwest of Des Moines. Josiah was a prominent businessman and well-known church worker in town, according to reporting from the former Des Moines Tribune.

The children were identified as: Herman Moore, 11; Katherine Moore,10; Boyd Moore, 7; and Paul Moore, 5. Lena Stillinger, 12, and Ina Stillinger, 8, who were visiting the family, were the daughters of J.T. Stillinger, a wealthy farmer living southeast of Villisca.

According to reporting from the Tribune, the victims were killed with an ax the killer, or killers, found in the family's backyard, while they slept sometime around or after midnight. The family had spent the evening at a program at the local Presbyterian Church and returned home around 10 p.m.

Neighbors reported they did not hear any cries from the rooms of the sleeping family.

The family was discovered in the morning after Josiah Moore didn't answer a call from his clerk. Neighbors became concerned that the Moores were not up doing their typical morning routines, prompting neighbors to call some of their relatives.

One person tried in vain to open the doors and windows of the home before calling the town marshal, who broke down the door when he arrived. The slain family members were found in different bedrooms throughout the house.

The marshal, Henry Horton, told a Moore relative as he walked out of the home: ""Somebody was murdered in every bed,"" according to Iowa Cold Cases.

The killer had added two ""bizarre"" touches to the murder scene, according to Iowa Cold Cases: Investigators found a 4-pound piece of slab bacon leaning against the wall next to the ax. The murderer also had searched dresser drawers for pieces of clothing to cover the mirrors in the house and the glass in the entry doors. Officials found a plate of uneaten food and a bowl of bloody water in the kitchen.

Nothing else was disturbed in the residence, according to Tribune archives.

Bloodhounds were sent from Nebraska in an attempt to hunt down a suspect.

""The slaying of the entire family promises to become a mystery which will take much time to unravel,"" a Tribune reporter wrote at the time.

Reverend acquitted by jury for family's murder

Authorities chased multiple leads over the years, including the Rev. Lyn George Jacklin Kelly, who left Villisca on a train the morning after the murders and allegedly told passengers about eight dead souls in Villisca who were butchered in their beds, according to Iowa Cold Cases. The bodies had not been discovered at that point.

Kelly signed a confession months later saying God had whispered to him to ""suffer the children to come unto me.""

He recanted his confession at his September trial. The jury deadlocked 11 to one for acquittal, according to Iowa Cold Cases. A second jury also acquitted Kelly in November.

No one else has ever been tried for the murders.

Visit the Villisca Ax Murder House

Documentaries, movies, and books have been created about the slayings at the Villisca house.

The house, redubbed the Villisca Ax Murder House, now is open for tours and overnight visits.

https://www.ktvh.com/news/federal-rule-will-require-montana-water-systems-to-catalog-lead-service-lines,Federal rule will require Montana water systems to catalog lead service lines,"HELENA — Over the last few years, there’s been a lot of discussion about the impacts of lead in drinking water – especially in places like Flint, Michigan. In response, the federal government has revised its regulations on lead – and one of the new requirements means more than 1,000 water providers in Montana will have to catalog any lead pipes in their system.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized its new “Lead and Copper Rule” late last year. It includes a provision, giving water systems until 2024 to complete an inventory of lead service lines – identifying where any are or confirming they don’t have any.

The rule applies to community water systems – including cities, towns, subdivisions and mobile home parks – that serve at least 15 households or 25 people. It also includes “non-transient” systems, like schools, nursing homes and other institutions that serve the same people over an extended period.

The Montana Department of Environmental Quality says the number of public water systems varies, but in a 2020 report, they identified 762 community systems and 296 non-transient systems.

Ryan Leland, the city of Helena’s public works director, says their water testing hasn’t shown any problems with lead contamination. He says the city didn’t have many lead water mains, and they’ve already replaced most of them.

“We have them identified, we’re on GIS, we have the plans,” he said. “They tend to be the mains that are undersized that we wanted to replace anyway. They corrode faster in our soils – that’s one main reason that they really didn’t use the lead.”

The bigger task will be identifying lead in service lines – the pipes that run from the mains to individual houses. Leland says the city plans to send out materials this summer or fall that will help residents look at their homes’ service lines and identify whether they’re likely to contain lead.

“We’re going to have to rely on homeowners to be able to look at what their service lines are,” he said.

For the moment, the rule doesn’t require lead service lines to be immediately removed. However, Leland said most of those lines are likely significantly corroded, so city leaders will recommend homeowners replace them if possible, to avoid the risk of leaks.

Leland said, when the city has identified lead service lines during large street projects, they have replaced them from the street to the property line. He said, from the property line to the home, those lines are the responsibility of the landowner. The city does offer zero-interest loans for eligible property owners wanting to replace service lines.

Lead was common in water pipes until Congress banned it in 1986. The EPA still estimates 6.3 million to 9.3 million homes nationwide have lead service lines.

Leaders have identified negative health effects from exposure to lead in drinking water – particularly for children. Early lead exposure has been linked to learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental delays and stunted growth.

The Montana Department of Environmental Quality says they’re working on ways to assist water systems with this process, providing technical support and guidance. They’re also working on a platform that the systems can use to enter their inventory results, but it’s still a while away from officially launching.",Q2

Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said Monday his investigators identified Shawn Eugene Gardner, 51, from the register at Motel 41 on U.S. 41. Gardner had to show a driver's license to rent the room, which Wedding said he did in exchange for $100 cash from the fugitives.

The sheriff's office did not arrest Gardner, Wedding said, because his actions didn't constitute a crime.

Gardner refused to speak to the Courier & Press about his interaction with the Whites in Evansville. He relayed that message from the Vanderburgh County jail, where he is being held in lieu of a $500 bond on unrelated charges of possession of methamphetamine, possession of a syringe and being an habitual offender.

More:Evansville local likely helped Casey and Vicky White get Motel 41 room, sheriff says

""His response: 'Absolutely not speaking,'"" Wedding said, including an obscenity he said Gardner used to punctuate the point.

Gardner pleaded guilty to attempted rape of an 80-year-old Evansville woman in 2003. The Courier & Press reported his arrest on Oct. 30, 2002, stating he was suspected of raping the woman in her home, stealing jewelry and coins and threatening to kill her and himself. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with credit for 150 days served, according to court records.

The National Sex Offender Public Website identifies Gardner as homeless.

How did Shawn Eugene Gardner meet Casey White and Vicky White?

Wedding said the Whites, who were the subject of a nationwide manhunt, met Gardner as he was leaving a motel on Fares Avenue on May 3. Gardner told investigators he didn't recognize the fugitive couple, the sheriff said.

Casey White and Vicky White were captured in Evansville on May 9. They had disappeared from the Lauderdale County jail in Alabama, triggering an 11-day, multistate manhunt. Casey is a convicted felon serving time for attempted murder and kidnapping. Vicky White was the corrections officer who reportedly helped him escape. She died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound following the chase.

The fugitives needed Gardner's help to rent Room 150 at Motel 41, Wedding said. Being an escaped convict on the run, Casey White didn't have an ID. Vicky White's name and photo was being published all over the nation.

Paul Shah, manager of the budget motel on U.S. 41, insisted last week that the Whites had been visiting a local resident who was staying there.

“(The Whites) were not officially registered guests here,"" Shah said. ""Somebody else checked in and they were visiting those people.""

Shah would not identify the renter, adding that the room was still occupied and is “still under that person’s name.”

But Wedding said Gardner told a sheriff's detective he never entered Room 150.

After the sheriff's office identified Gardner from the Motel 41 register, investigators tracked him down with help from the Evansville Police Department.

EPD spokeswoman Sgt. Anna Gray said a sheriff's detective asked police to be on the lookout for Gardner. An EPD officer spotted him and notified the detective.

It wasn't that hard to find Gardner even though he is homeless, Gray said.

""We get that quite often. You know, the officers on the street, they get to know a lot of the homeless people out there, and they know where they stay and know them by sight,"" she said.

""So it’s just a matter of, ‘Yeah, I recognize him. I know he hangs out at this area, so I’ll be on the lookout for him.' They just got lucky enough to find him.""

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trulieve-executives-buying-their-company-shares-here-s-what-we-know-1031491351,"Trulieve Executives Buying Their Company Shares, Here's What We Know","A significant number of Trulieve (OTC:TCNNF) executives, including CEO Kim Rivers, CFO Alex D'Amico, president Steve White and Christine Hersey, executive director of investor relations bought up company shares. The list goes on to include another half-dozen company executives to reach a total of 31,650 shares. Rivers now owns just under 2.5 million shares, D'Amico acquired 1,500 shares and Trulieve's president Steve White bought 7,000 shares.

Most analysts agree that company stock buy backs create value for own shareholders. In this case, Trulieve seems to be demonstrating extreme confidence in the company.

""Trulieve has consistently demonstrated its ability to build scale in this competitive industry, and our leadership team jumped at the opportunity to buy additional shares as soon as our trading window opened post earnings. We are more confident than ever in Trulieve’s future despite ongoing market volatility experienced by cannabis and mainstream sectors alike,"" Kim Rivers told Benzinga.

""Trulieve is strategically positioned to meet growing national consumer demand through our enhanced cultivation capabilities and expansive retail footprint,"" Rivers added.

Meanwhile, Cantor Fitzgerald's Pablo Zuanic maintained an Overweight on Trulieve, in a recent note, though he lowered his price target to $57 from $59 on slightly reduced EBITDA estimates.

When Trulieve's earnings came out, Rivers said the Tallahassee-based company was ""off to a great start in 2022.""

That comment was born out as the company continues opening cannabis dispensaries across various states, with the two most recently in West Virginia where it is expected to open five more this year. Trulieve has at least 167 operated and affiliated dispensaries nationwide, with operations in Massachusetts, California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, now including West Virginia in its northeast hub and applications in Georgia, its southeast hub.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2022-06-21/concerns-raised-as-san-diego-launches-enforcement-of-long-awaited-street-vendor-law,Concerns raised as San Diego launches enforcement of long-awaited street vendor law,"SAN DIEGO — Enforcement of San Diego’s long-awaited street vendor crackdown begins Wednesday, potentially bringing an end to three years of chaos that has dramatically changed the look and feel of many popular city locations.

Community leaders and merchant groups say they’re cautiously optimistic the new city law will make a big difference, but some are concerned about inadequate enforcement.

Others are frustrated the new law won’t take effect in coastal areas for several months while the city awaits Coastal Commission approval, possibly flooding those areas with even more vendors fleeing tougher restrictions in inland areas.

Meanwhile, leaders in Mission Beach say vendors should immediately be banned in areas around Belmont Park because of a 1980s ballot measure they say the city has been failing to enforce for many years.

Critics continue to say the city’s new vendor law is too punitive and aggressive, stressing that it bans vendors from most high-traffic and profitable areas. They also say it has racist overtones because most vendors are immigrants of color.

City officials characterize the new law as the right balance between fostering vendors as a new class of entrepreneurs and preventing them from damaging the character of parks, beach areas and business districts.

“San Diego has long awaited these regulations that will bring vendors into the formal economy and ensure access to San Diego’s public spaces for all,” said Councilmember Dr. Jennifer Campbell, who spearheaded the new law.

Cities across California have had to react to SB 946, a 2018 state law that decriminalized sidewalk vending but allowed cities to impose limited regulations if they focus only on health and safety — not keeping vendors out.

San Diego recently started issuing permits that vendors will need to continue operating under the new law. Vendors who serve food will also need a county health permit and a food handler’s card.

The city will enforce the permit requirements and other elements of the new law, such as where vending is allowed, with a team of code enforcement officers — not police officers.

“I hope it will make a difference,” said Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter Association. “I’ll have a very good sense after the first day.”

Trimble successfully persuaded the City Council, which approved the new law 8-1 in May, to partially ban vendors from the entire Gaslamp Quarter. But he noted Tuesday that some Gaslamp vendors aren’t mom-and-pop operations, but larger-scale efforts where multiple hot dog vendors work for the same company.

“It’s going to take a lot of effort to dismantle the hot dog operators downtown,” he said. “It’s going to take a lot more than just coming out a couple times and giving people warnings.”

Larry Webb, president of the Mission Beach Town Council, expressed similar concerns.

The new city law includes fines and possible impoundment of vendor pushcarts for rules violations. But Webb noted that it would take as many as four violations for vendors to experience fines and penalties that really matter.

Webb is also frustrated city officials have decided not to start enforcing the ban in the coastal zone — essentially any land west of Interstate 5 — until the California Coastal Commission can consider the new law and possibly amend it.

He said Santa Monica and some other coastal cities have enforced street vendor crackdowns in recent years without Coastal Commission approval.

A spokeswoman for City Attorney Mara Elliott said Tuesday that Elliott’s reasoning for seeking such approval before launching enforcement along the coast is confidential.

“There is no public memo on this topic,” said the spokeswoman, Leslie Wolf Branscomb.

Webb said enforcing the law inland and not on the coast will prompt vendors facing new restrictions everywhere else in the city to flood the coast.

“We’ve seen a big increase in the last several weeks,” said Webb, estimating that there are roughly 100 vendors in the area on weekdays and many more on weekends.

Webb also thinks Mission Beach could be saved from vendor chaos by a sort of magic bullet. He says city voters approved a ballot measure in the 1980s aimed at upgrading Belmont Park by banning retail operations there except the brick-and-mortar businesses in the park.

He said the city hasn’t enforced the measure in many years, but could start enforcing it now.

In Ocean Beach, community leaders say Veterans Plaza near the pier is overrun by vendors and could get worse because of the city’s plan to delay enforcement on the coast.

“We’re hoping the Coastal Commission will take this up quickly and stop the chaos,” said Denny Knox, leader of the Ocean Beach Main Street Association. “It seems unreasonable for communities to have to deal with this. It was never meant to be a swap meet.”

Knox said there is some cautious optimism that the city’s approval of the new law will prompt vendors to move to new locations immediately, instead of waiting for the Coastal Commission.

“We’re hoping these vendors see the writing on the wall and know it’s not going to be a long-term shtick,” she said.

There have also been complaints about vendors taking over Scripps Park at the Children’s Pool in La Jolla and parts of Balboa Park.

The new law bans vendors only during the busy summer months — instead of possibly banning them year-round — in Balboa Park and many of the city’s beach areas.

It also targets vendor bans on main thoroughfares in some business districts, like Little Italy and Ocean Beach. Vendors can continue operating on the cross streets and side streets in those areas.

In addition to restricting where vendors can operate, the new law restricts what they can sell. Prohibited items include alcoholic beverages, tobacco, vaping products, cannabis, pharmaceuticals, live animals and weapons — including knives, guns, or explosive devices.

To help vendors prepare, in-person workshops have been hosted in both English and Spanish this spring by the Logan Heights Community Development Corporation.

The law also creates “entrepreneurship zones” — places where vendors would get chances to flourish together with possible financial help from the city. Locations for those zones have not been chosen.",Q2
https://punchng.com/new-york-to-clamp-down-on-bitcoin-mining/,New York to clamp down on bitcoin mining,"The state of New York wants to ban new bitcoin mining operations, a move that some industry insiders fear could have a domino effect across the U.S.

According to CNBC, the bill, which is making its way through Albany, calls for a two-year moratorium on certain cryptocurrency mining operations that use proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions.

Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, has virtually become synonymous with bitcoin, though ethereum — at least for another few months — still uses this method to secure its network.

Lawmakers sponsoring the legislation say they are looking to curb the state’s carbon footprint by cracking down on mines that use electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels. For two years, unless a proof-of-work mining company uses 100% renewable energy, it would not be allowed to expand or renew permits, and new entrants would not be allowed to come online.

The net effect of this, according to Galaxy Digital’s Head of Mining Amanda Fabiano, would be to weaken New York’s economy by forcing businesses to take jobs elsewhere.

“New York will be left behind, losing to other states at best, and at worst, other more progressive nations. New York is setting a bad precedent that other states could follow,” said Fabiano, echoing a concern held by many in the crypto industry.

At this point, the State Assembly has passed the bill, and it is now under consideration by the Democratic-controlled State Senate, which will soon vote on the measure. If it passes, it will land on the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it.

“If it passes, it would make New York the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure,” explained Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce.

Miners compete in a low-margin industry where the only variable cost is typically energy, so they have a strong economic incentive to migrate to the world’s cheapest sources of power – which also tend to be renewable.

A third of New York’s in-state generation comes from renewables, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New York counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100 per cent carbon free electricity goal, and the state produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains.

The state also has a chilly climate, which means less energy is needed to cool down the banks of computers used in crypto mining, as well as a lot of abandoned industrial infrastructure that’s ripe for repurposing.

Crypto mining company Coinmint, for example, operates a facility in a former Alcoa aluminum smelter in Massena, which taps into the area’s abundant wind power, plus the cheap electricity produced from the dams that line the St. Lawrence River. The Massena site, at 435 megawatts of transformer capacity, is billed as one of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the U.S.

But not all operations run on renewables. Companies like Greenidge Generation, which operates its bitcoin mining facility in a former coal plant retrofitted for natural gas, have drawn the ire of some lawmakers who now want to stamp out the state’s crypto mining industry.

The northern border town of Plattsburgh temporarily enacted its own local ban on cryptocurrency mining operations in 2018, and just last year, politicians tried to shut down parts of the mining industry statewide. That move failed after a union representing electrical workers came out in defense of the mining industry.

This latest effort, however, appears to have real teeth.

One section of the bill currently under consideration in Albany involves conducting a statewide study of the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining operations on New York’s ability to reach aggressive climate goals set under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires New York’s greenhouse gas emissions be cut by 85 per cent by 2050. Boring tells CNBC the recent swell of support in favour of this year’s proposed ban has a whole lot to do with this mandate to transition to sustainable energy..",Q2

The Ecuadoran National Assembly failed to override a presidential veto of an abortion bill that critics feared would make abortion a human right and require healthcare workers in the country to participate in the practice against their will.

After President Guillermo Lasso partially vetoed an abortion bill passed by the majority-Catholic South American country's unicameral legislature, the National Assembly had until Friday to override the veto.

The motion to lift the presidential veto Thursday received just 17 votes, far short of the majority required for a veto override. National Assembly President Guadalupe Llori has adjourned the legislative session, so the president’s veto of the measure stands.

Valerie Huber, the CEO of the Institute for Women’s Health who served as the U.S. special representative for Global Women’s Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the Trump administration, told The Christian Post in an email that the pro-life movement “won” the battle in Ecuador.

“It was created supposedly to just create a very narrow exception for abortion in matters of rape but in reviewing the law, it was pages and pages and pages of things that had absolutely nothing to do with that narrow exception,"" Huber argued.



""More than 20 times, it asserted abortion as a human right. It removed all conscience protections for any kind of healthcare providers that would be called upon in that country to provide abortion against their consciences.""

Ecuador's abortion laws are opposed by international abortion-rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, which contends that the country's criminalization of abortion ""undermines the ability of women and girls to access essential reproductive health services.""

“Ecuador should remove all criminal penalties for consensual abortion,"" Ximena Casas, women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""At a minimum, it should guarantee effective access to abortion on all legal grounds and stop prosecuting women and girls seeking essential medical care.”

Huber had voiced her concerns about Ecuador's abortion bill in an April 5 op-ed for National Review. She argued that the bill “sets the stage for a whole upending of the country’s laws"" and asserts ""that abortion is a fundamental right.""

Huber praised Lasso for removing “any assertion that there is an international right or that abortion is a human right,” adding that he “addressed virtually all of the concerns that we had in terms of how it would not only harm women, but it was unconstitutional because Ecuador has a very pro-life provision in their constitution.”

Article 45 of the Ecuadoran Constitution proclaims that the government “shall recognize and guarantee life, including care and protection from the time of conception.”

Huber insisted that the Institute for Women’s Health ""is not a pro-life organization"" but should be seen as ""a pro-women’s health organization.”

“We would like it if we never had to talk abortion,"" she stated. ""It’s really those who are elevating abortion over authentic women’s health that are conflating the two.”

“But I will tell you that those who would insist that a woman can’t have health without abortion are organized,"" she continued. ""They have overtaken the narrative surrounding women’s health. But it’s a disingenuous narrative that most Americans and most citizens around the world don’t realize how harmful this really is to women.""

Huber expressed concern about “women’s health being subjugated to an ideological agenda with little concern for women themselves.” She also lamented the “external interference” of members of the U.S. Congress in the “internal abortion decisions of other countries.”

A letter written by Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., and 19 other congressional Democrats urging Lasso to support the legislation drew the ire of Huber. Human Rights Watch also expressed support for the legislation and the congressional Democrats’ letter.

“Research by Ecuadorean and international human rights organizations shows that abortion restrictions do not stop abortions from happening,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. “Instead, they force women and girls to seek abortions in clandestine settings where abortions are carried out unsafely and lead to health complications and even death. The World Health Organization has reported that the rate of unsafe abortions is four times higher in countries with restrictive abortion laws than in countries where abortion is legal.”

The pressure campaigns from U.S. lawmakers and nongovernmental organizations constituted “colonialism by another name,"" Huber contends.

She cited the efforts in support of the law as an example of how “American abortion activists want to impose their extremism on other countries.” The effort, she says, extends far beyond Ecuador and touches “virtually any country that currently has laws protecting life during every stage of life.”

“The sad reality is that few Americans know what the United States is doing to devalue life abroad and to pressure countries to change their laws on areas that are fully within the sovereign right of those countries to decide and that the United States should not be interfering,"" she said.

Huber argues that some provisions in U.S. law prevent officials from ""exporting an abortion agenda."" She cited the Helms Amendment, which prohibits any tax dollars being used abroad for abortion or for its promotion. The 1981 Siljander Amendment states that the U.S. tax dollars may not be used to fund or lobby for abortion.

“[The] United States is a major funder for foreign assistance, particularly foreign health assistance. So the threat of withholding foreign assistance unless governments change their policies or laws regarding certain issues is always of concern,"" Huber said. ""And we have heard from a variety of countries how this continues to be a lever used by the U.S. government.""

“We’re not talking about using these sorts of levers over what most Americans would believe to be legitimate reasons regarding authentic human rights violations or things such as this,"" she continued. ""We’re talking about foreign assistance being used as a lever for the promotion of ideological colonialism around these very sensitive topics, those topics where the U.S. had absolutely no business interfering in the internal affairs of that country.”

She also said that if a country refuses to make amendments to specific laws, the U.S. may use the visa-granting process or trade incentives.

""Democracy is being … redefined to include these issues of ideological colonialism,” she asserted.",Q2
https://www.ktvu.com/news/bay-area-japanese-americans-reflect-on-80-years-since-u-s-incarceration,Japanese Americans reflect on 80 years since U.S. incarceration,"Eighty years might feel like distant history for some people, but for Karen Korematsu, May 30, 1942, will always mark a moment in her family's personal history.

""This Monday, May 30th will be 80 years when my father was arrested in San Leandro for disobeying military orders,"" said Korematsu.

It was eight decades ago when the U.S. government put more than 110,000 Japanese immigrants and American citizens into concentration camps based on their ethnicity, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That number would grow to 120,000 by the time World War II ended in 1945.

Korematsu's father Fred Korematsu was an American citizen who challenged the government by refusing to report to the assembly center in April 1942. He was picked up by police in May.

""He thought he had rights as an American citizen. Why should he go to a prison camp when he had done nothing wrong and only because he looked like the enemy,"" said Karen Korematsu. Her father Fred Korematsu stayed in the East Bay until he was caught.

For Satoshi Hibi, a 91-year-old Bay Area man, memories of April 1942 are quite clear.

At the time, a stranger snapped a family photo of Hibi standing with his mother and his younger sister. The photo shows them waiting with their luggage along a street. Hibi is standing and wearing a jaunty hat as he faces his mother. He was just a grammar school student at John Muir Elementary School in Hayward.

The stranger, it turns out, was the famous photographer Dorothea Lange, who was taking photos for the government.

""We were waiting to take the bus to Tanforan,"" said Hibi,

At the Tanforan racetrack in San Bruno, Hibi remembers being confused.

""We were not allowed to leave. They give you a number and assigned a place,"" said Hibi, ""We were told to make mattresses. All the residents had to go put hay in the bags. That's what we used for mattresses. I got pneumonia, and I was at camp hospital.""

Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941 had unleashed a tidal wave of fear and anti-Japanese hate.

Hibi and other children who were too young to understand war, were old enough to feel the pain of prejudice.

""I remember losing all my friends. Their parents said don't go there,"" said Hibi, ""I was picked on, beaten up at school.""

""We lost everything,"" said Hibit, whose parents were artists and ran a Japanese school in Hayward.

""When the order came, people just had days, less than a week to get their affairs in order. People had to sell their homes, their businesses, their farms. They could only bring what they could carry,"" said Steve Okamoto, whose parents were American citizens and were sent to the Tanforan, assembly center when he was just a baby.

His family had been in San Francisco since 1898. Still, they were forced to leave their home and were sent to Tanforan racetrack.

""My family and others, we had to live in a horse stall, a horse stall that was filled with manure and urine, no partitions in toilets, having to lose your name and wear a tag with a number,"" said Okamoto.

Tanforan was one of the dozens of makeshift assembly centers on the West Coast.

From there, people were transported to one of the 10 concentration camps or other detention centers across the U.S. The internees were forced to live for years in drafty barracks behind barbed wire on desolate land. Families were sometimes separated, their livelihoods and lives lost.

Hibi's family was imprisoned at Topaz, Utah.

The internees' fate had been decided by the stroke of a pen, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942.

Executive Order 9066 authorized the military to create military exclusion zones and force civilians out.

The Executive Order never mentioned Japanese immigrants or citizens. Discrimination and fear on the West Coast, however, had been growing long before Pearl Harbor.

""It was years and decades of discriminatory legislation. Japanese could not become citizens in this country. They could not own land,"" said Rosalyn Tonai, executive director of the National Japanese American Historical Society.

""The attack on Pearl Harbor really catalyzed that fear and prejudice that ran rampant, which led to the incarceration and exclusion of Japanese Americans along the West Coast,"" said Tonai.

It was at San Francisco's Presidio that Lt. General John DeWitt declared the entire West Coast a military zone.

DeWitt's office, remains preserved, but empty on the second floor of a Presidio building that's now a private school.

National Park Service Ranger James Osborne DeWitt gives tours of DeWitt's office and the role the Presidio played in the incarceration of Japanese Americans.

""It was in this office in March of 1942 that he signed all those assembly orders,"" said Osborne, ""The 108 exclusion orders applied only to people of Japanese ancestry.""

Some 80,000 of those in the concentration camps were American citizens, many of them children.

""So really this is where it became racist. And there were none on the East Coast saying people of German ancestry all have to report,"" said Osborne, ""Because there was this sense of urgency, we'd just been attacked, it was easy to say they aren't as human as we are, or they're not as loyal.""

Osborne says ironically, DeWitt knew that less than a mile from his office housed in building 640, was a secret project, the Military Intelligence School where 58 Japanese Americans were training to become wartime interpreters, loyal soldiers even as the law punished their parents.

""This was top secret, they could not tell their families under court-martial, they were threatened not to tell anyone their whereabouts or what they were doing. This was actually one month before Pearl Harbor,"" said Rosalyn Tonai, Executive Director of the National Japanese American Historical Society.

The school building along Crissy Field is now a museum and also honors the tens of thousands of young Japanese Americans who joined the military to fight for the U.S., despite being in a segregated unit.

The 100th Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team was the most highly decorated unit in history, for its size and duration, receiving numerous awards including 21 Medals of Honor.

Other Americans took a different path to show their patriotism, fighting for their rights in the courts.

Fred Korematsu, Mitsuye Endo, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui, all filed cases objecting to the incarceration.

""All due process of law was denied. So the Japanese Americans never were charged with a crime, access to an attorney or had their day in court. And my father thought it was wrong as an American citizen,"" said Korematsu.

Korematsu's legal battle went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. He lost his case Korematsu v. United States in a 6-3 decision by the justices.

At the Presidio Officers Club, an exhibit has a quote, however, from dissenting Justice Owen Roberts, who called it ""a clear violation of Constitutional rights.""

""This...is the case of convicting a citizen as a punishment for not submitting to imprisonment in a concentration camp, based on his ancestry and solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty,"" writes Justice Owen Roberts.

In the 80 years since Executive Order 9066, there's been a national reckoning of the wrongs.

Researchers uncovered secret government documents showing no Japanese American espionage or need for mass incarceration.

In the courts, judges vacated the convictions of three men, Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and Min Yasui.

In 1989, President Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act which included an official apology for the incarceration and a $20,000 check for reparations.

""The Japanese Americans did get reparations. It took almost 50 years for Congress and President to sign the Civil Liberties Act,"" said Osborne.

The letter of apology and reparations check from President Bush came too late, however, for many who had already passed on.

At the Presidio Officers Club, an exhibit called Exclusion details the Presidio's role in the incarceration proceedings.

In the hallway as part of the exhibit, a wall of windows bears the names of the detainees. Satoshi Hibi's name is among those who were incarcerated in Topaz, Utah.

Each person's story is a part of the nation's history.

Now, it is a race to honor the legacy they leave behind while they are still able to share their stories.

The National Japanese American Historical Society has re-opened the Military Intelligence Service Historic Learning Center with new exhibits to help educate students and the public about the history of Japanese Americans who are credited with helping to bring the war to a close more quickly.

At Tanforan, a memorial to the 8,000 people who passed through the assembly center is set to be completed in July.

""We're building a memorial right now because most of these 8,000 they're not here any more,"" said Okamoto.

For some survivors, there is the hope that history will not be repeated.

The Korematsu Institute is planning to hold more educational seminars and workshops nationwide in the coming years to raise awareness about Fred Korematsu's case and the implications it has on current issues.

""My message is Fred Korematsu was one person who made a difference in the face of adversity and so can you,"" said Karen Korematsu.

There is also hope that future generations will find lessons to live by.

""During wartime, the treatment of innocent people,"" said Hibi, ""People are not treated as individuals but as members of groups.""

""I would like them to know what FDR did. It's his ultimate responsibility,"" said Hibi, ""He could have asked for more tolerance.""

https://1025kiss.com/ten-more-rules-buffalo-springs-lake-should-consider-approving/,10 More Insane Rules Buffalo Springs Lake Should Consider Approving,"Get our free mobile app

As we reported Wednesday, the Buffalo Springs Lake Board of Directors, staff and ordinance committee members will host a town hall Thursday evening at 7 p.m. as they seek public input on some controversial rules and ordinances they're looking at putting into place.

Some of the more controversial/ridiculous rules being considered would limit how many fishing poles a person can use, ban loud or just annoying music, outlaw language that offends people, and even prohibit the throwing of balls. Seriously, you can read the the story and the language of those ordinances here. Also included as a possible rule? No pets at the beach.

In the spirit of those crazy proposed rules, we've come up with 10 more that we think the people of Buffalo Springs Lake would like.

Spray-on Sunscreen

Those wishing to use spray-on sun screen must do so before arriving at Buffalo Springs Lake or must stand a minimum of 10 feet away from other individuals so as not to accidentally discharge sun screen onto someone else. After spraying and rubbing in sun screen, the user must be approved by Buffalo Staff that the sunscreen has been used in the proper manner.

Beach Dwellings

(a) Sand Castles, Sand Huts, Sand Homes, or any type of sand building of any kind is prohibited unless the builder applies for and receives a proper Buffalo Springs Lake Sand Dwelling Permit. Permits can be purchased for a low $35 fee at the gate. Each permit is single use meaning that if a Sand Dwelling is destroyed by nature or family member, another permit is required to rebuild.

(b) Sand Dwellings can be no taller than 3 feet high and no wider than 3 feet. No rocks, sticks, or vegetation is allowed in the building of a Sand Dwelling.

Large Groups

No more than 5 people may gather in a group in any one space on the beach or along the shoreline. Parents who have more than three children can pay for an extra child waiver at the gate.

Splashing of Water

Any purposeful splashing of water is prohibited at Buffalo Springs Lake. Not every visitor to the beach or to the lake wants to get wet. Splashing of water could also result in injury or drowning.

Modesty

Those at our beach should dress in modest swimwear so as to not upset the ordinary sensibilities of others. Also, this isn't a club; it's a lake, and children are present.

Fishing Activities

Hooks are no longer permitted at Buffalo Springs Lake as they could cause injury and trauma to fish and humans. Noodling and catching fish via net are both still acceptable.

Pickleball

It sounds fun, but includes a potential projectile, laughter and paddles. This can't be allowed.

Limiting Our Carbon Footprint

To better serve our climate, no more than 20 gas-powered trucks and SUVs will be allowed inside Buffalo Springs Lake at any given time. A climate fee for such vehicles will be imposed at the gate. For our visitors with electric vehicles, no fee will be assessed and you will receive priority parking and access to the boat ramp.

Cookouts & Grilling

Smoke from foods being prepared on the grill should not be allowed to linger or float into someone else's space.

Scary Stories While Camping

Visitors are no longer allowed to tell scary stories around a campfire. Such stories may scare kids and could cause crying which could annoy or wake up others. Positive, up-lifting stories around a campfire are encouraged.

These are just a few more rules that I thought the leadership at Buffalo Springs Lake may enjoy. Am I missing any?

Progressive Christian leaders are planning what they hope will be the largest gathering ever of low-income Americans and their allies in Washington, D.C., this weekend to help advance anti-poverty and anti-racism efforts.

Known as the “Mass Poor People’s & Low-Wage Workers’ Assembly and Moral March on Washington and to the Polls,” the gathering is scheduled for Saturday and was first announced earlier this year by The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival.

The organization behind the rally takes its name from the Poor People’s Campaign launched by the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in 1967. The organization is led by the Rev. William Barber II, an NAACP leader and pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Goldsboro, North Carolina.

Barber has often voiced his support for left-leaning causes, such as abortion, and was a strong critic of former President Donald Trump. In 2017, he remarked that faith leaders praying over the then-president at the White House “borders on heresy.” Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, Barber hosted openly gay Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg at his church and maintained that Jesus never spoke out against homosexuality.

The Poor People’s Campaign seeks to “confront the interlocking evils of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, militarism and the war economy, and the distorted moral narrative of religious nationalism,” according to the organization’s website.

The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has voiced its support for eliminating the Senate filibuster to get President Joe Biden’s agenda passed. The filibuster requires most legislation to receive 60 votes to pass. The Senate currently consists of 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, meaning that most legislation requires the support of at least 10 Republicans before it can become law, an elusive goal in a highly polarized era.

The Rev. Liz Theoharis, the co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, previously cited abolishing the filibuster as necessary to “save the soul of our democracy” and thwart the effort to “filibuster the expansion and protection of voting rights, to filibuster living wages, and healthcare, and housing, and adequate guaranteed incomes, and debt cancellation, and water, and sanitation, and housing rights, and so much more.”

The Rev. Alvin O’Neal Jackson, national executive director of the June march, told The Christian Post in an interview that the event is part of an overall effort to “shift the political narrative,” “build power” and “make real policies to fully address poverty and low wealth from the bottom up.”

“This March will be the largest gathering of poor people and their moral allies in the history of our country,” Jackson asserted to CP.

“It will be a generationally transformative and disruptive gathering of poor and low-wealth people, state leaders, faith communities, moral allies, union and partnering organizations.”

Jackson views the event, which he noted as being an “assembly-march,” as something that “will spring us toward the 2022 elections and beyond.”

“Before the assembly-march and after the assembly-march we will be doing MORE: mobilizing, organizing, registering, educating, engaging and empowering people for a movement that votes,” he added.

The march hopes to influence candidates running in the upcoming midterm elections for Congress, in which all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 35 seats in the Senate will be contested.

Several mainline and Evangelical church leaders have announced their intentions to participate in the rally.

The Rev. Jimmie Hawkins, director of the Presbyterian Church (USA) Office of Public Witness in Washington, has spoken at past Poor People’s Campaign events.

In an interview with CP, Hawkins explained that he was “inviting Presbyterians from around the country to be present and to participate locally in chapters working in their states.”

“The Poor People’s Campaign is one of our coalition partners, and we have participated in many of their events, their prophetic council weekly calls, and shared announcements of their programs,” Hawkins said.

“The campaign’s policy statements align with those of the PC(USA) on many issues, including healthcare, voting rights, living wage, criminal justice reform, and others.”

Hawkins told CP that he sees the rally as “a mobilization of low-wealth people around the world on issues of common concern” and that it was “of vital importance that people are able to cross racial and political differences to address the issues that affect all.”

“It is an opportunity to create a community that is composed of those most impacted by restrictive policies and harmful legislation and organized to act,” he concluded.

The Rev. Nancy Petty, pastor at Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh, North Carolina, will also be taking part in the march, having been a longtime supporter of the Poor People’s Campaign.

Petty told CP that she supported the march because her faith “requires me to speak out against injustices and to be an advocate for the marginalized and the oppressed,” noting that the June 18 march “addresses issues of injustice.”

“From the perspective of my faith, I feel a responsibility to be involved in these kinds of movements that advocate for the poor,” she said. “Are we going to be a nation that keeps widening the gap between the poor and the rich?”

“Or are we going to live up to the ideals of our founding forbears that we are a nation that is a nation of opportunity, that cares, that we care for one another, that we believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all?”

The Poor People’s Campaign event will take place the day before Juneteenth, a holiday celebrating the day in 1865 when Union troops announced to black slaves in Galveston, Texas, that they were free.

Also known as Freedom Day or Jubilee Day, Democrat President Joe Biden signed a law last year making Juneteenth an official federal holiday, the first new federal observance since Republican President Ronald Reagan created Martin Luther King Day in 1983.",Q2
https://kdal610.com/2022/06/24/the-experiences-that-led-these-u-s-abortion-opponents-to-activism-2/,The experiences that led these U.S. abortion opponents to activism,"By Sharon Bernstein, Gabriella Borter and Brad Brooks

(Reuters) – For a Mississippi doctor, it was a glimpse of a fetal arm. For a police officer, it was the treatment of anti-abortion protesters outside a clinic. A Catholic leader was galvanized by the civil rights movement.

These and other experiences shaped prominent abortion opponents in their decades-long effort to see the U.S. Supreme Court reverse the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion.

That long-awaited moment came on Friday, when the conservative-led court overturned Roe. Four leaders of the anti-abortion movement reflect on how they reached this point.

DR. BEVERLY MCMILLAN

Most Fridays, Dr. Beverly McMillan, 79, can be found praying outside Mississippi’s only abortion clinic.

Her quiet opposition is a far cry from the start of her obstetrics and gynecology career. In 1975, McMillan became the first doctor to provide abortions at Mississippi’s first free-standing abortion clinic.

She resigned abruptly three years later, she said, “struck with the humanity” of a pregnancy she aborted. In an interview, she recalled how she could make out the tiny arm muscle of a 12-week-old fetus, reminding her of her young son.

The Jackson, Mississippi, resident has dedicated much of the four decades since trying to sway public opinion against abortion.

About 60% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Even so, McMillan and fellow anti-abortion advocates successfully pushed for legislation such as her state’s 15-week abortion ban, which spurred the legal battle that led to the Supreme Court ending federal protections for abortion.

McMillan, who serves as vice president on the Pro-Life Mississippi board, said the organization was dedicated to getting practical support for women struggling in pregnancy.

“While this was a necessary step in continuing to build a culture of life in America, there is still a lot of work to be done,” she said after the ruling.

She hopes one day there will be a “personhood amendment” to the U.S. Constitution that says what to her has long been obvious: “Human life begins at conception and has the same inalienable rights that born people have.”

TONY PERKINS

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Christian policy and lobbying group in Washington, says he felt called to the anti-abortion movement on a summer day in 1992.

He was off duty from his job as a reserve police officer in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and had joined members of his church to check out an Operation Rescue protest at a local abortion clinic. He was shocked by what he called police abuse of the hundreds of anti-abortion protesters gathered at the clinic.

He spoke out and was fired from the force, he said.

“I just saw this for the first time in a much different light,” said Perkins, an ordained Southern Baptist minister. “This really is a colossal battle between … good and evil.”

Upon entering politics and serving as a Louisiana state representative from 1996 to 2004, he pushed through legislation aimed at restricting abortion, including the first version of a state law regulating women’s health clinics. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law in 2020.

Perkins, 59, said abortion became the litmus test for evangelical Christians as their political force grew in the last three decades: If a politician opposed abortion, they likely agreed with evangelical voters’ other policy stances.

He credits the Roman Catholic Church with leading the way in the abortion fight but said evangelicals injected new energy into the movement from the 1980s onward by getting anti-abortion politicians elected to statehouses.

Those socially conservative lawmakers passed a raft of state-level restrictions on abortion.

Soon after the ruling on Friday, Perkins tweeted he was “grateful that the tyranny of Roe has ended.”

THERESA BRENNAN

In February 2020, Theresa Brennan left her job as a corporate lawyer to take the helm of the anti-abortion group her grandparents helped found in California in 1967.

The Right to Life League says it was the country’s first organization dedicated to opposing abortion. Brennan remembers how as a child she longed to join her grandparents and parents at the group’s annual fundraising gala.

Later as a young woman, she disagreed with their stance, feeling it wasn’t her place to tell others what to do with their bodies. It wasn’t until she had her own children that Brennan says she fully embraced her family’s anti-abortion beliefs and, later, their activism.

“I think being pregnant and realizing what that was really made me think twice,” said Brennan, 52.

Since becoming the group’s president, Brennan has put her legal background to work providing advice to the network of crisis pregnancy centers, anti-abortion medical clinics and maternity homes the organization represents.

As some of the pregnancy centers move toward becoming clinics that provide some medical guidance and services, Brennan helps them comply with state laws regulating such activity.

Her organization also lobbies against abortion rights bills and provides donations of diapers and other supplies to pregnancy centers and maternity homes.

The end of Roe v. Wade makes it all the more important to direct funds and other resources to help women and children, she said.

“It would transform the entire movement, I’m certain of it, if we could just get the resources,” she said. “Because if women really felt supported and had the resources, they would choose to have their baby.”

ARCHBISHOP JOSEPH NAUMANN

Under Archbishop Joseph Naumann’s direction, the Archdiocese of Kansas City has put $500,000 behind an August ballot measure asking Kansas voters to amend the state constitution to say it does not include a right to an abortion.

With Roe overturned, Naumann called on “all Catholics and all people of good will” to support the amendment.

“I am grateful the Supreme Court has returned the right to the people to determine public policy that protects the lives of unborn children as well as their mothers from the tragedy of abortion,” he said in a statement.

Naumann, 73, was in seminary in 1973 when the Roe decision legalized abortion in the United States. Like other devout Catholics, he opposed abortion, but at the time he was more focused on the civil rights movement.

He said he began to view abortion through the lens of civil rights in 1984, when he was asked to lead the church’s anti-abortion efforts in St. Louis. He felt the right to life was fundamental to the unborn, who he believed were fully human from the moment of conception.

“Of course it is a right of a woman to decide when to bear a child, but once that child is conceived, there are two human beings who both have rights at that point,” he said.

The archbishop said the St. Louis role taught him numerous ways to fight abortion, at church and beyond, and he took that knowledge with him as he rose through its hierarchy. He served seven years on the U.S. bishops’ Committee on Pro-Life Activities including as chairman.

He has joined bishops who have said President Joe Biden and other Catholic leaders who support abortion rights should not take Communion.

Naumann said he has deep sympathy for women facing unplanned or difficult pregnancies. He was raised by a single mother, he said, after his father was murdered at work while she was pregnant with Naumann.

BOISE, Idaho — Timmy Kinner, the man who killed a 3-year-old girl during a mass stabbing in Boise in 2018, has been moved out of an Idaho prison.

On Thursday, Idaho Department of Correction spokesman, Jeff Ray, confirmed to KTVB Kinner was moved to an out-of-state facility.

""An interstate agreement allows states to exchange residents to assure their safety, and the secure and orderly operation of a correctional facility, Ray said. ""Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Kinner has been moved to an out-of-state facility to assure his safety and the safety of others.""

In June of 2021, Kinner was sentenced to two fixed life sentences without parole, followed by 120 years behind bars.

Kinner pleaded guilty earlier in 2021 to first-degree murder and 11 other charges in connection to the mass stabbing at a child's birthday party at the Wylie Street Station Apartments.

Three adults and six children were wounded, including the little birthday girl Ruya Kadir, who died from her injuries.

Bifituu Kadir, her mother, said the attack happened when she stepped back into her apartment to get Ruya's cake.

""I had a very happy girl. My daughter was very happy. She was sitting outside,"" Kadir said through a translator. ""That man was outside sitting. So I had no idea that this individual was planning to kill my daughter.""

""I wish he killed me instead,"" she continued during Kinner's sentencing.

Officials say Kinner, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, knew no one at the party and had no reason to target the victims. Although those hurt were refugees from Iraq, Syria and Ethiopia, police say they do not believe their immigration status played any role in the attack.

Defense attorneys painted Kinner as a deeply mentally ill man from a troubled background. Abandoned in a storage shed at age two, Kinner was showing signs of possible schizophrenia by age seven, and ended up a caretaker for two smaller siblings with special needs while still a young boy himself. Both of his parents were addicted to crack cocaine, capital mitigation specialist Julia Yackel said, and as many as seven members of his family have been diagnosed with schizo-type or psychotic disorders.

Kinner bounced from homeless shelters to jails to prison to Los Angeles' infamous Skid Row before alighting in Boise just before the attack.

In a victim impact statement, Ruya's mother said that her life had been difficult as well, but she never used it as an excuse for violence. Kadir said she left her own family at 12, and cleaned toilets to eke out a living. Sometimes she wanted to die, she said, but her infant daughter gave her the will to live back. Ultimately, the two of them came to the U.S. as refugees when Ruya was just four months old.

Kinner pursued victims as they ran away, hid behind a curtain and leapt out onto them, and seemingly chose the youngest and smallest to go after, prosecutor Dan Dinger said. At some point, he came upon Ruya, sitting outside in the June evening, waiting for her slice of cake.

https://www.towleroad.com/2023/05/montana-tiktok-ban-unrealistic-and-misguided-experts/,Montana TikTok ban unrealistic and misguided: experts,"While US politicians voice concerns that China could get TikTok user data, the lack of national data privacy law leaves brokers free to gather and sell information about what people do online

San Francisco (AFP) – A total ban of TikTok in the US state of Montana is set up to face an epic battle in the courts, but many experts wonder whether the law is even technically possible.

Montana is the first US state to ban TikTok, with the law set to take effect next year as debate escalates over the impact and security of the popular video app that is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.

“You would have to build a Great Fire Wall of Montana,” said Tarah Wheeler, chief of cyber security firm Red Queen Dynamics and a senior fellow for Global Cyber Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.

“Maintaining a ban in the state and remaining free of the kind of surveillance you are trying to escape is not possible,” she added.

The prohibition will serve as a legal test for a national ban of the Chinese-owned platform, something that lawmakers in Washington are increasingly calling for.

Five TikTok creators in the state have already filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing the ban is illegal and violates free speech rights.

The app is accused by a wide swathe of US politicians of being under the tutelage of the Chinese government and a tool of espionage by Beijing, something TikTok furiously denies.

Despite its immense popularity, TikTok faces an ultimatum by the White House that it split from its Chinese owners or stop operating in America.

According to the law, which was signed on Wednesday by Governor Greg Gianforte, a violation takes place each time “a user accesses TikTok, is offered the ability to access TikTok, or is offered the ability to download TikTok.”

Montana could not enforce the ban “without doing a whole bunch of other things we don't want the governments of any level in the United States being able to do,” said Cyber Threat Alliance chief Michael Daniel.

Causing further trouble, young TikTok fans are likely to take advantage of free virtual private network (VPN) software that lets people disguise where devices are.

Technically adept teenagers in Montana will suddenly use VPNs to be seen logging from other states, Wheeler said, which also introduces vulnerabilities to spyware or malware, which are known to lurk in some VPNs.

Teens being teens

While the ban was passed under the auspices of protecting TikTok users in Montana from China snooping, no clear evidence of that has been shown, according to Jason Kelley, acting activism director at internet rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.

It is the lack of national data privacy law in the United States that leaves users vulnerable, with brokers free to gather and sell internet user information, Kelley noted.

“If China wants data on users, they could just go buy it,” Kelley told AFP.

The bill behind the ban mentioned TikTok pranks referred to as “challenges,” and one Montana legislator lamented his son taking part in one of those.

“Reading between the lines, I think these legislators are angry that they don't understand the culture of TikTok and how young people use it,” Kelley said.

“Montana legislators wanted to do anything to push back on the negative impact of teenagers being teenagers and the influence of TikTok to do stupid things.”

And, while the law bans Apple or Google from making TikTok available for download in Montana there are other places online to get apps for Android-powered smartphones.

“There is no chance this law will work, even if it is implemented by TikTok to the extent possible,” Kelley said.

The ban will take effect in 2024, but be voided if TikTok is acquired by a company incorporated in a country not designated by the United States as a foreign adversary, the law read.

This was an invitation by Montana legislators for TikTok and the White House to come up with some sort of arrangement that would see the app divest from ByteDance.

Lyrissa Lidsky, professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law, told AFP that the ban will easily be seen to violate fundamental free speech laws in the US where companies are afforded the same rights on speech as individuals.

“The politicians think that this is a successful political strategy whether it's constitutional or not,” she added.",Q2

At least 90 firefighters fought the fire for about 90 minutes after it was discovered at a loading dock, but the risk of an explosion forced them to retreat. The fire quickly consumed the entire building and caused it to collapse.

A National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Tuesday ordered that Sultan, accused of sheltering terrorists, be freed on bail. But he was never released and was, instead, detained illegally at a Srinagar police station, Sultan’s lawyer Adil Abdullah Pandit told The Telegraph.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Today, we received information that he has been booked under the PSA,” Pandit said. “It’s now clear they want to keep him behind bars and the charge of harbouring terrorists was just an excuse.”

The PSA allows detention without trial for up to six months, and makes bail difficult to obtain. Pandit said Sultan would be sent to Jammu’s Kot Bhalwal jail, 300km from Srinagar, on Monday.

The special NIA judge had said he was granting bail because he had found “no direct evidence nor any substantial evidence on record that would have connected the accused” to the alleged crime.

Sultan had received the John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award from the American National Press Club in 2019 and featured in Time magazine’s 10 “most urgent” cases of threats to media freedom around the world in 2020.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit organisation, later ran a full-page ad in The Washington Post to express solidarity with him.

Last year, the Clooney Foundation for Justice, established by Hollywood star George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal Clooney, announced it would monitor Sultan’s trial. But the hearings have been deferred multiple times, with hardly any held since the pandemic broke out.

Sultan, a reporter with the news magazine Kashmir Narrator, is the first Valley journalist to be booked under the anti-terror Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and was arrested in 2018. He is charged with sheltering militants who had killed a policeman, an accusation his family and lawyers deny.

His only child, daughter Areeba, born a few months before his arrest, has been participating in the family’s tireless campaign for his release.

Sultan’s family, magazine and lawyer insist he was arrested for his professional work, saying his ordeal began after he wrote an article, “The Rise of Burhan”, for the magazine in 2018.

Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani was killed by the security forces in July 2016. The police had earlier accused Sultan of glorifying militancy in his writings.

Sultan is the third Valley journalist detained under the PSA since January this year, after news portal editor Fahad Shah and his trainee reporter Sajad Gul.

A Press Council of India fact-finding committee recently revealed that a staggering 49 journalists had been arrested in the Valley since 2016. It said the government was slowly choking the media in the Valley through “extensive curbs”.",Q2
https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/firefighters-extend-deployment-schedules-to-fight-multiple-wildland-fires/,Firefighters extend deployment schedules to fight multiple wildland fires,"FARMINGTON, N.M. – It’s a relentless battle for firefighters so far this year. Crews have been working around the clock to contain fires – some over 100,000 acres in size.

Those battles are not fought alone, but with the help of firefighters from across the southwest on wildland fire deployments.

“When I first started 24 years ago, and if we had a 10,000-acre fire, at that time that was a big fire, now the fires that we are seeing are two to three to 400,000-acre fires,” David Vega, deputy chief of operations for San Juan County Fire and Rescue, said.

Vega adds that fighting fires today is a lot harder than it was in previous years.

“Those fires require a tremendous amount of resources to contain and control those fires, so no agency can do it alone,” said Vega.

So, San Juan County Fire and Rescue dedicates resources to just that – helping out their neighbors.

“A typical wildland deployment is a two-week commitment, potentially to go up to 21 days we have an engine right now on the Cerro Pelado Fire, that’s supporting operations there, that crew just completed a two-week deployment and was requested to extend for another seven days so that engine will be out for 21 days,” Vega said.

Every boot on the ground matters, especially when fighting a fire that’s hard to control.

“Those winds prevent aircraft from flying, so not having that air support is making the job of contain and controlling those fires difficult. So every time there is a blow-up situation, those crews have to pull back on the line and hunker down in a safety zone and wait until the fire gets to a point geographically where it’s safe,” Vega said.

Vega adds that there is no longer a fire season, but a fire year. Crews will have to work up to 18 hours a day to fight them.

“These guys and gals are missing birthday parties, missing seeing their kids every night. If they’re in areas where there is no cell service, they’re not able to contact their families at night and that puts an emotional strain on the crews,” Vega said.

Vega adds that it is important for New Mexicans to create a wildfire evacuation plan, in case a fire sparks near your home.",Q2

Body camera footage shows detectives surrounding the Spring Hill home where a man held two elderly residents and two children hostage. (Pasco Sheriff)

SPRING HILL, FL — Deputies from the Pasco and the Hernando County sheriff's offices shot and killed a man they said broke into a home and began shooting at deputies outside, according to Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis.



In a joint news conference with Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco late Tuesday afternoon, Nienhuis said around 2:30 a.m. a man and woman broke into a home on Balsam Avenue in Hudson, tied up an 89-year-old man who was sleeping in the house and stole some items from the home and the man’s SUV.

Nocco said a second woman was waiting outside and drove off in a separate vehicle. The resident, who was unharmed, freed himself and called 911 around 6 a.m. About 45 minutes later, Hernando County deputies were called to a vehicle on fire on Dandelion Court in Spring Hill that turned out to be the stolen SUV, said Nienhuis.

Just before 1:30 p.m., Pasco detectives found the vehicle driven by the third accomplice and followed it to where the driver and passenger, both women, were disposing of items stolen during the home invasion. The detectives confronted the two women, who admitted to stealing the items and told detectives that the man who took part in the home invasion was at a home on Holly Hock Lane in the Hernando County section of Spring Hill.

While Hernando detectives obtained a warrant for the home, other detectives kept an eye on the home and spotted a man outside the house around 1:20 p.m., Nienhuis said. The man fled when he spotted the detectives and a Pasco K9 was brought in to track him as residents reported seeing a man jumping fences in the area.

The man eventually broke into a home and took the residents — two elderly people and two children — hostage, Nienhuis said. Around 1:50 p.m., the man went into the garage of the home and began shooting at law enforcement outside. “Make no mistake about this,"" Nocco said at the news conference. ""If the individual started firing rounds that were going inside the house, we would have attacked. We would have gone inside that house. We would have neutralized the subject and rendered aid.” Instead, law enforcement didn't return fire for fear of accidentally shooting one of the hostages. When the man finally left the house, he exchanged gunfire with deputies, who shot him around 2:05 p.m. He was taken to a local hospital, where he later died, according to Nienhuis.

At least four deputies were involved in returning fire — three Hernando County deputies and one Pasco County K9 deputy, Nienhuis said. All four have been placed on administrative leave while the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigates the shooting.

The names of the deputies involved, and the victims have not been released. The Hernando Sheriff’s Office identified the man who was fatally shot as Victor Thomas Torres, 42.

“It’s sad there’s any loss of life, but at the same time, the suspect dictated our actions,” Nocco said.",Q2

Tennessee state law regulates who can perform marriages, specifically blocking online ministers

A 2019 law added possible felony charges for flouting the ban

A federal lawsuit challenging Tennessee's ban on online-ordained ministers performing marriages can go ahead, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this week.

The suit, which argues in part that a 2019 law violates religious protections of the First Amendment, has been mired in questions over a procedural tangle on sovereign immunity that could have killed the suit in early stages.

The Universal Life Church Monastery, a ministry that ordains ministers online, sued Tennessee over the law in 2019. They argued in legal filings that the law violates the constitution by discriminating against ""certain religions or religious denominations.""

The law, the suit says, ""prefers"" certain denominations because it allows some ministers to solemnize marriages while preventing those with ""online ordinations.""

Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton and judges Jane Branstetter Stranch and John K. Bush heard arguments and joined Friday's opinion, penned by Bush.

The appellate court considered the state's motion to dismiss and ultimately upheld that certain online ministers have standing and several defendants, including district attorneys in Rutherford, Hamilton and Putnam counties, are not immune.

General Assembly:Tennessee marriage bill fails to advance in General Assembly after age-limit controversy

Tennessee has long regulated who can preside over weddings, Bush wrote in the opinion, all the way back to a 1778 act. In opinions from the state attorney general and actions by lawmakers, Tennessee has chipped away at the ability of ULC ministers, and those similarly ordained, to legally ""solemnize the right of matrimony.""

The 2019 law clarified criminal penalties — a Class E felony punishable by one to six years in prison and a $3,000 fine — could be levied against an online-ordained minister in some circumstances.

The crime would be prosecuted as someone making a false entry in a government record — ""for instance, by claiming to have solemnized a marriage despite knowingly lacking the requisite authority,"" Bush explained.

Lawmakers raised concerns the ability to become ordained by filling out a simple form online, as ULC offers, falls short of the law's requirements that the person being ordained did so as a “considered, deliberate and responsible act."" That argument has been echoed by attorneys for the state in the ongoing litigation.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in 2019 said the suit raised ""serious constitutional issues"" that should be considered at trial.

He issued an injunction allowing ministers ordained online to continue to perform legal marriages.

Appellate judges ruled only on the immunity question, not the constitutionality of the law. The case will continue in the U.S. District Court in Middle Tennessee.

Steur was one of 10 people shot and wounded on April 12 when a gunman fired dozens of bullets in a train full of morning commuters. The man charged in the attack, Frank James, has pleaded not guilty to terrorism and other counts.

In the lawsuit, Glock is accused of “marketing that emphasizes firearm characteristics such as their high capacity and ease of concealment, that appeal to prospective purchasers with criminal intent.""

The lawsuit was filed as the nation reels from last week's massacre of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

In February, the families of nine victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting reached a $73 million settlement in a lawsuit against Remington, the maker of the rifle used in that attack.

The families said the company should have never sold such a dangerous weapon to the public. They said their focus was on preventing future mass shootings by forcing gun companies to be more responsible with their products and how they market them.

Gun rights groups said the settlement would likely have little effect on rifle sales and gun makers, who continue to be shielded from liability in most cases under federal law. But some experts said it may prompt insurance companies to pressure gun makers into making some changes.",Q2

Korangi SSP Faisal Bashir Memon said that Abdullah recently returned home in Ibrahim Hyderi after spending 40 days with Tableeghi Jamaat.He left his home on Friday at 3pm and was found unconscious on a street near a mosque in Zaman Town’s Tasawar Mahal checkpoint at about 6pm, he said, adding that two people from the mosque informed the checkpoint in charge about the man lying unconscious. The policemen went there and found a cell phone in his pocket. They rang to his mother, who reached the spot along with her brother Yasir.They took Abdullah to a nearby hospital in Korangi where doctors asked them to take him to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases. They moved him to the cardio facility, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.The SSP said the family took away the body without completing medico-legal formalities. At around 10.15pm, Yasir, the maternal uncle of the victim, called Madadgar-15 and said Abdullah was ‘tortured to death’ allegedly by the policemen posted at the checkpoint.He said soon after 100-150 protesters gathered at the Tasawar Mahal Chowki and restored to violence and set two parked motorbikes on fire.The SSP said after a considerable time, the police pacified the protesters and convinced the family to take the body to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for a post-mortem examination.He said doctors did not find any apparent injury marks on the body. However, Dr Summaiya Syed, the additional police surgeon of the hospital, said the cause of death was reserved for histopathological and chemical examiner’s report.She said the post-mortem examination was carried out in the presence of relatives and police at 2am on Saturday.The family alleged that that Abdullah had gone to buy Iftar items on a motorbike. He was stopped by the policemen deputed at the checkpoint. As he did not carry with him the bike’s documents, the policemen allegedly took him inside the kiosk and allegedly tortured him.The SSP said DIG-East Muqaddus Haider ordered an inquiry to ascertain the veracity of the family’s allegations.Policeman commits suicideLater, a policeman, who was present at the checkpoint and called for initial inquiry, committed suicide by shooting himself to death.The Sharafi Goth police said that Head Constable Mohammad Sajjad, 38, was posted at the Tasawar Mahal police post along with two other policemen when the incident was reported.The Korangi SSP said Sajjad and two other policemen were called on Friday night after the incident. He said he appeared to be an “emotional person” and was in “depression”.He said apparently he ended his life as he feared that he might be implicated in a murder case.",Q2
https://www.wqcs.org/wqcs-news/2022-04-20/bills-curbing-disneys-special-district-and-social-media-exemption-advance,Bills Curbing Disney's Special District and Social Media Exemption Advance,"Tallahassee - Wednesday April 20, 2022: Governor DeSantis came under fire Tuesday from Democrats in the Senate’s Community Affairs Committee over the 2 bills he submitted to lawmakers at the start of the ongoing special session on re-districting.

One of the measures removes the theme park exemption in a bill targeting companies that censor conservative speech, an exemption carved out for Disney last year in a bill that has since been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court which issued a temporary injunction blocking it. The Governor’s bill removing that exemption was introduced by Republican Senator Jennifer Bradley. She said the intent is to remove the theme park exemption to satisfy the court’s objection. “This bill makes clear to the court that it is the opinion of the legislature and ultimately the governor that we intent for this bill to apply to those entities,"" said Sen. Bradley.

However Democrat Senators Janet Cruz and Gary Farmer weren’t buying it. They called the measure the Governor’s attempt to punish Disney for its opposition to the Parental Rights in Education bill, that critics have called the 'Don’t Say Gay' Bill.

“That’s what this is about,"" said Sen. Cruz. ""We’ll get ya, if you say anything that a Governor who’s running for President doesn’t want you to say."" Sen. Farmer called it ""an act of political payback by our Governor.”

The other measure proposed by the Governor would terminate Disney’s special jurisdiction, the Reedy Creek Improvement District, by June 1 of 2023, unless lawmakers decide to revise the terms of the District at their next Session, before then.

Republican Sen. Bradly was again called on to introduce it. “There remain 6 Special Districts that have not had any legislative oversight what-so-ever for over 50 years. And so the bill says, let’s start that oversight. And I do believe that it is reasonable to say that Disney and Reedy Creek is not above Legislative oversight.""

Democratic Senator Tina Polsky opposed. “We haven’t pointed to one thing that we thought Reedy Creek has done wrong that the independent special district needs to be taken away. All of this going after our number one attraction in the state makes no fiscal sense. And what’s the end goal. Do we want Disney to shut down? That we don’t need the tourism dollars? We don’t need the tax dollars?”

The only other republican on the committee to speak in support of the 2 bills was Travis Hutson.

“Looking at this independent District, they have a whole host of exemptions from local government, and pretty much they can do whatever they want. So, I’m willing to have this conversation today knowing that we will have further conversation on how this will look in the future.”

Both bills were approved by the Committee on Tuesday along partisan lines. The full Senate then approved both bills on Wednesday, also along partisan lines. The Florida House is expected to vote on both measures Thursday.",Q2

New York City felt like it was almost its bustling self again as I walked through the streets enjoying the warm spring weather during a recent trip.

The city, like many others, is forever changed after more than two years of the COVID pandemic, but in true New York fashion, the Big Apple is coming back. It was my second trip within six months after about a two-and-a-half-year break.

New Yorkers rolled up their sleeves (more than 80% are vaccinated), masked up and have done pretty much everything they can to get their groove back. However, COVID subvariants continue to emerge in the ongoing pandemic. Some venues are still enforcing proof of vaccination and masks. Face coverings are still required on all public transportation until further notice and in Broadway theaters at least until May 31.

Recently, COVID cases have been on the rise in New York due to the new highly contagious Omicron subvariant, BA.2.12.1. People planning to visit should check the city’s visitor site, under Basic Information, at VisitNewYork.com for the latest.

Some Broadway shows have canceled performances due to COVID. Other shows are taking place. New restaurants are opening, and reservations are harder to get than ever before. New museum exhibits are opening. Big events are coming back like New York Pride, which returns in-person June 26 with the theme “Unapologetically Us.”

“Our community has been through tremendous hardships over the past few years, beginning with the pandemic, and continuing with a reckoning with social justice, threats to our democracy and more recently armed conflict overseas,” stated NYC Pride’s new executive director, Sandra Perez, in a March 25 news release. “Compounding these struggles is the onslaught of legislation around the country that directly targets LGBTQIA+ individuals.

“In spite of these challenges and attacks, we are here to tell the country and the world: we will not be erased,” Perez continued, stating that the community will stand together to face the attacks on the LGBTQ community across the country and around the world. “We will continue to love and live our truth and be our full and complete selves – and we are not going to apologize for it.”

NYC Pride board co-chair Sue Doster noted the importance of the annual celebration that attracts upward of two million people from across the United States and all over the world.

“We’re thrilled to be able to finally invite everyone back,” she stated.

Tourism officials said the city is rebounding.

“The city is as vibrant as ever,” said Chris Heywood, a gay man who’s executive vice president of global communication of NYC & Company, New York City’s destination marketing and convention and visitor’s bureau.

The pandemic did not completely stop New York from retrofitting, innovating and building new hotels, spectacular sites and opening new restaurants.

“That’s the beauty about New York,” Heywood continued. “Resilience is really our middle name. People are going to encounter a city that is continuing to come back.”

New attractions

Some of the new things to see in New York are Summit One Vanderbilt, the Moynihan Train Hall and Little Island, the latest park near the Chelsea Piers.

The city’s newest vantage point is at Summit One Vanderbilt. The Summit is a 65,000 square foot space at the top of the 93-story office and residential building at One Vanderbilt adjacent to Grand Central Station.

The observatory deck opened in October 2021. It is much more than the highest view (for the moment) of New York City; it’s an experience with a view. Each room is an art installation accentuating the feeling of being high in the sky or in the clouds. At the very top are Apres and the Summit Terrace, where my girlfriend and I enjoyed a cocktail while admiring New York’s sparkling skyline under the night sky.

Tickets to catch the sunset view cost about an extra $16. The Summit does not itemize what the extra amount is at checkout, but it’s for experiencing the Summit at the golden hour, the optimal time of day.

It wouldn’t be New York City without the many opportunities to see art. This spring and summer visitors can catch the 80th edition of the Whitney Museum of American Art’s “Biennial 2022: Quiet As It’s Kept,” which opened April 6. The two-floor exhibit brings together a survey of 63 American artists exploring the darkness and disruption of 2020. The title is a colloquial phrase taken from the late novelist Toni Morrison. The show runs through Sept. 5.

Henri Mattise lovers can take in a rare exhibit of the French artist’s early works that formed modern art at the Museum of Modern Art exhibition “Mattise: The Red Studio,” which opened May 1. The show runs through Sept. 10.

The Brooklyn Museum is featuring “Andy Warhol: Revelation,” showing now through June 19.

Brooklyn Academy of Music is featuring the DanceAfrica Festival, which is celebrating its 45th anniversary through the end of this month.

I rarely leave New York without seeing at least one show on Broadway. Right now, it’s all about the classics and some new musicals (“Wicked,” “Chicago” and “Funny Girl”) and plays (“Plaza Suite” and “To Kill A Mockingbird”).

Dining and drinking

Food draws my girlfriend and I to New York just as much as Broadway’s musicals. For this trip, I sought out restaurants that were old favorites that survived the pandemic, some that were reborn, and others that were new.

During the day we lunched at the fun, cheeky and very gay diner Cafeteria; a Chelsea neighborhood staple, Elmo; and famed chef and restaurateur David Chang’s Momofuku Noodle Bar.

At night we hit the town enjoying dishes crafted by some of New York’s finest lesbian chefs. Chef and restaurateur duo Rita Sodi and Jody Williams’ beloved Via Carota lived up to the hype. You can’t go wrong with pasta, but this is exceptional pasta. I also dined at the culinary couple’s newest venture The Commerce Inn. It veers away from the chefs’ usual turf, French and Italian cuisine, exploring and modernizing American Shaker dishes that hit the mark.

Lesbian executive chef Hillary Sterling crafted a distinctive Italian menu at Ci Siamo, restaurateur Danny Meyer’s latest culinary venture. Lesbian executive chef Mary Attea at the Michelin-rated The Musket Room serves a revisioned world on your plate. There was no doubt that I wouldn’t enjoy chef and restaurateur Mark Strausman’s new restaurant Mark’s Off Madison which has a warm atmosphere and incredible, flavorful comfort food.

Two unique restaurants that might signal a shift in the queer culinary scene in New York are Tagmo and Hags. Both restaurants are queer-owned and -operated. They actively hire LGBTQ staff and are deeply involved in the community.

Queer chef Surbhi Sahni is the heart behind Tagmo, an Indian restaurant that opened in Seaport, a small shopping and dining center near One World Trade Center, in September 2021. Tagmo is not your average Indian restaurant. Dining there is a gastronomic adventure through India with all its diverse cuisines.

The much-anticipated Hags is targeted to open just ahead of Memorial Day weekend, May 25. The Lower Eastside restaurant aims to be the first upscale queer restaurant, according to business and life partners Telly Justice, a transgender woman, and Camille Lindsley, a queer woman.

New York’s nightlife isn’t quite what it used to be like yet. My girlfriend and I enjoyed early nightcaps at Tiny’s & The Bar Upstairs in Tribeca, the historic Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, and Bar Veloce in Chelsea.

Village lesbian bar mainstays – Henrietta Hudson and Cubbyhole – and Brooklyn’s Ginger’s Bar got makeovers during the pandemic and recently reopened. Catch roving lesbian events hosted by Dyke Beer and Dave’s Lesbian Bar on their websites or follow them on social media.

The boys are back in action from Midtown to Harlem with bars and nightclubs for every stripe in the rainbow flag. Check out Midtown’s swanky The Townhouse of New York. Head to the

West Village’s Playhouse or get nostalgic at New York’s oldest gay bar Julius’ and the historic Stonewall Inn. Head uptown to Harlem for the last remaining Black-owned gay bar Alibi Lounge.

Where to stay

My girlfriend and I stayed at the Smyth Tribeca. The newly renovated modern 100-room hotel opened in September 2021. The hotel is comfortable, chic and perfectly located on the corner of Chambers Street and West Broadway above the Westside’s 1 line. The subway line is a direct vein to Broadway, the Village and many of New York’s most popular destinations.

BOWLING GREEN, Ohio — The family of Stone Foltz is suing Bowling Green State University, saying it bears responsibility for his March 2021 death following a hazing incident at an off-campus fraternity house.

Cory and Shari Foltz appeared Thursday on CBS Mornings to discuss their son's death and the pending lawsuit. The family is seeking an unspecified amount of money, but according to the lawsuit, they are seeking ""in excess of $25,000"" for each of the two claims listed.

The lawsuit was filed on Shari Foltz's behalf by Columbus-based Cooper Elliott law firm. The plaintiffs contend BGSU is not only responsible for Foltz's death, but knew there was a history of hazing on the campus over many years.

""BGSU is responsible for Stone Foltz's death,"" the lawsuit reads. ""For years, BGSU turned a blind eye to hazing within the Greek organizations on its campus while encouraging students like Stone to join its fraternities and sororities.""

The lawsuit lists a dozen reports of hazing incidents involving BGSU fraternities dating back to 1996. In each case, the lawsuit claims, the university failed to properly handle the incident or punish the Greek organization involved.

The lawsuit also spells out a dozen incidents involving hazing at Pi Kappa Alpha chapters around the country and argues that the fraternity ""has established a system that is toxic and dangerous to unsuspecting undergrads it persuades to pledge.""

""Unbeknownst to the Foltz family, sending Stone to BGSU was a death sentence,"" the lawsuit reads.

Finally, the family argues that BGSU officials knew of the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter's Big/Little hazing ritual that involved forced drinking, but did nothing to stop it.

Statements from Foltz family and BGSU

Alex Solis, deputy chief of staff and Bowling Green State University spokesperson, issued the following statement Wednesday night regarding the complaint filed in the Ohio Court of Claims by the Foltz family against BGSU:

“Stone Foltz’s death was a tragedy, and what his family has endured is unimaginable. However, this lawsuit is meritless and undermines our continued efforts to eradicate hazing. We are resolved in our legal position, and as a state-supported university, we will defend our community vigorously against this action. This will not deter our goal to continue to foster a community of care that serves our students and their families.”

Cory and Shari Foltz statement:

""We promised Stone that we would end hazing on college campuses for good. By filing a complaint against Bowling Green State University, we are doing what is necessary to hold people in power accountable for their woeful inactions to keep students safe and reckless disregard for illegal activity.

Despite being completely aware of the hazing activities that have taken place at Bowling Green for decades, the University enthusiastically endorses Greek life to parents and students. To be clear, any perceived benefit students get from joining a Greek organization is completely and totally outweighed by the risk of injury or death by antiquated and deadly hazing rituals.

What happened to our son at Bowling Green State University is not unique. Students across the country will continue to experience humiliation, injury and death from hazing without immediate change. We demand increased education for students, transparency for parents, zero-tolerance policies for Greek organizations and immediate action from University leaders who have complete control over what happens on their campuses.

Change cannot happen without accountability; more than anything, we want to prevent another family from living our nightmare.""

Foltz's death and aftermath

Foltz, 20, was at a Pi Kappa Alpha, or PIKE, new member initiation the night of March 4, 2021. New members, known as ""littles"" and who were almost all underage, received ""bigs,"" or mentors, who gave their littles high alcohol content liquor and instructed them to drink the whole bottle.

Foltz drank all or nearly all of the bottle given to him before he was dropped off at his apartment. Foltz was found by his roommate and other friends, who called 911.

The roommate performed CPR until EMS arrived. Foltz was taken to the Wood County Hospital and later to Toledo Hospital, where he died on March 7.

The coroner said Foltz died of fatal ethanol intoxication. His blood alcohol content was 0.394 percent, according to the family, who said it was likely even higher immediately after the alleged hazing ritual.

In April 2021, BGSU permanently banned PIKE from campus after the fraternity was found to have engaged in a pattern of hazing over a number of years.

""This expulsion is because of hazing, which is absolutely intolerable,"" a BGSU spokesman said in a statement. ""The University's investigation found the fraternity to be reckless with a disregard for the health and safety of our community. This investigation also revealed a deep culture of deception rooted in the organization, filled with dishonesty and disrespect for our community.""

On July 30, 2021, BGSU expelled three students and suspended 17 others for their role in the incident following an investigation.

In October 2021, Gov. Mike DeWine signed Collin's Law and increased penalties for hazing. The legislation elevated a general hazing charge to a second-degree misdemeanor, and aggravated hazing to a third-degree felony.

Collin's Law was named after former Ohio University student Collin Wiant, who died after a hazing incident in 2018. The legislation stalled in Columbus before being reintroduced after Foltz's death.

https://freebeacon.com/democrats/why-the-looting-wont-stop/,One Man's Case Shows Why the Looting Isn't Going To Stop Any Time Soon,"Two George Soros-backed prosecutors in suburban Washington, D.C., bounced a serial looter who committed multiple grand larcenies and assaulted a cop between their offices for years without a felony conviction.

Fairfax County commonwealth's attorney Steve Descano (D.) and Arlington County commonwealth's attorney Parisa Dehghani-Tafti (D.) since 2020 dismissed or declined to prosecute a 25-year-old Maryland resident for nearly a dozen charges related to larceny. The looting incidents amounted to thousands of dollars in stolen merchandise and include felony offenses, including two grand larcenies and one assault on a police officer, making the offender eligible for years behind bars. The prosecutors found the looter guilty of just a few misdemeanors. No verdict levied more than a few hundred dollars in fines, and he served no time in prison.

The out-of-state offender, Ronald Thomas, spent virtually no time in jail after his arrests thanks to bail reform policies instituted by Descano and Dehghani-Tafti. At least five times he was charged for committing crimes in one jurisdiction while on pretrial release in another. He was twice charged for committing larcenies within a day of having similar larceny charges dropped—with one of those incidents happening in the same county.

The case exemplifies the degree to which lightened sentencing can embolden repeat offenders. Studies have shown that releasing defendants before their trial increases crime. A few years after Cook County, Ill., instituted bail reform, a 2020 study by the University of Utah found a 45 percent increase in the number of released defendants who were charged with committing new crimes and a 33 percent bump in released defendants charged with violent crimes.

""When you lower the likelihood of pretrial detention through bail reform, you increase the number of pretrial defendants who are going to be out on the street,"" Rafael Mangual, a senior fellow and head of research for policing and public safety at the Manhattan Institute, told the Washington Free Beacon. ""There's going to be an increase in crime.""

Those subsequent crimes also tend to be more violent. ""You always hear about the nonviolent drug offender or the nonviolent property crime,"" Mangual said. ""The reality is that there's actually a lot of overlap between who commits violent offenses and who commits lower-level misdemeanors.""

Thomas is no exception. In between when his Virginia cases were opened and dropped, he was charged with theft, robbery, and assault in neighboring Maryland.

Democratic megadonor George Soros donated more than half-a-million dollars to Descano's and Dehghani-Tafti's 2019 campaigns, helping them oust veteran prosecutors who had served a combined 60 years in their counties. Both ran on a progressive criminal justice platform, promising to end cash bail in most cases and reduce incarceration. They've kept those promises and pointed to a general crime decrease as proof of their platform's success. Their critics have countered that fewer convictions can mask the true crime rate.

""You can't claim crime has decreased when you've also bragged about not prosecuting over 20 types of crimes,"" Virginia attorney general Jason Miyares (R.) told the Washington Free Beacon. ""The crime hasn't gone away—only the prosecution.""

Miyares also told the Free Beacon the Virginia prosecutors' pattern of light prosecution will lead to more victims.

""Just because a crime is 'nonviolent' does not mean there was no victim or that no innocent life has been affected,"" Miyares said. ""These far-left prosecutors repeatedly dropped charges against a serial larcenist and allowed him to commit more crimes and victimize more Virginians because they prioritize ideology instead of public safety.""

Descano and Dehghani-Tafti did not respond to a request for comment.

In the past few years, states such as New York and New Jersey have passed laws allowing for pretrial release in most cases. Cities including Philadelphia and San Francisco have followed suit. San Francisco district attorney Chesa Boudin (D.) abolished cash bail in 2020 and has opposed many felony convictions, including for drug-dealing charges, robberies, and larceny. The liberal prosecutor is now facing a recall effort amid a spike in homicides, violent shootings, overdoses, and retail theft.

Thomas carried out his larceny spree as attitudes toward looting shifted since the summer of 2020. Politicians, activists, and writers on the left defended the practice during riots around race that summer in America's cities. In one notable example, NPR interviewed the writer Vicky Osterweil, whose 2019 book In Defense of Looting argued the practice was a ""joyous and liberatory"" response to the injustices of a ""cisheteropatriarchal racial capitalist society."" Reports showed many looters came from out of state to participate and often escaped without charges—an outcome underwritten by progressive bail laws and lightened sentencing guidelines.

Virginia changed its law for larceny sentencing in July 2020 under former Democratic governor Ralph Northam, doubling the felony threshold from $500 to $1,000. Liberal criminal justice reform groups such as Justice Forward Virginia and the Virginia ACLU had long advocated for the move. Justice Forward in 2021 also backed ending third-strike felonies for petit larceny, noting the ""disparate racial and economic impacts that such legislation creates among people of color and the poor.""

Even given the raised sentencing threshold in Virginia, one of the grand larcenies Thomas allegedly committed in Fairfax totaled $4,000—more than four times the new felony threshold. Former members of the Fairfax County commonwealth's attorneys' office who spoke with the Free Beacon said choosing not to prosecute felony grand larcenies is rare.

Arlington County has yet to publish its 2021 annual crime report. In 2020, property destruction, auto theft, robbery, and assault all rose in the county. Fairfax County in 2021 saw an uptick in violent crimes, including a 40 percent increase in homicide.

The Free Beacon reported in March how Descano's office in 2021 dropped felony charges on a man arrested for attempting to abduct and defile a hotel housekeeper. One year later, the man was arrested again after he allegedly killed two homeless men and wounded three others during a nine-day shooting spree in D.C. and New York City.

Those who oppose Descano, Dehghani-Tafti, and Loudoun County commonwealth's attorney Buta Biberaj, another Soros-backed prosecutor, launched efforts to recall the trio in 2022. The groups, Stand Up Virginia and Virginians for Safe Communities, say they are motivated by the dangers liberal prosecutors pose to public safety.

""Yet another career criminal victimizes the community with total impunity because a radical prosecutor-activist handed him a 'get out of jail free' card,"" said Virginians for Safe Communities president Sean Kennedy. ""This case is not the exception any longer, it's the rule.""

Thomas was extradited to Montgomery County, Md., on May 24, according to the Fairfax County Detention Center. He is set to stand trial in June on charges of second-degree assault, theft, and robbery, as well as in July on charges of theft valued at more than $1,500. He was charged in Prince George's County, Md., in 2020 for theft, only to have those charges dropped a year later.",Q2

Earlier this month, University Heights Charter School (UHCS), a pre-K to grade 8 public charter school in Newark, announced that the New Jersey Department of Education has ruled to revoke its charter on June 30 – leaving hundreds of local families stunned and scrambling for alternatives. Read More: Newark School's Charter Revoked; 700 Families 'Frantically Scrambling' According to UHCS administrators, the department of education cited New Jersey School Performance Report Comparative Performance Data from the 2018-2019 school year, including test scores, as part of the reason for the decision, although this year’s scores remain unannounced.

The state also based its decision on the school’s alleged inability to develop a comprehensive academic plan after it was placed on probation in 2019 prior to the coronavirus pandemic, NJ Spotlight News reported. The state's ruling comes as UHCS is preparing students and their families for the end of the 2021-2022 school year on June 17, and the beginning of a summer enrichment program, which was scheduled to begin on July 6.

STUDENT PROTEST On Monday, a group of about 40 sixth grade students held a peaceful protest against the state decision, also speaking in the names of their peers at the other two UHCS facilities: the lower school that stands just across Hartford Street, and the junior high school, located a few blocks away on Fulton Street and Broad Street.

With chants of “Save Our School,” the students kicked off their protest on Hartford Street at 8:15 a.m., marching through nearby neighborhoods and returning at 10 a.m. The march was done with the blessing of school administrators, some of whom joined with teachers to support the students. “We heard the school was to be shut down so this is our way of fighting to keep this school open,” said Jaylene Rivera, a sixth grader who helped to spearhead the rally.

“We want people to hear us and what UHCS means to us,” Rivera said. Emily Cerda, another student leader, is determined to remain a student at University Heights Charter School. “I have been here since kindergarten,” Cerda said. “This school has been very important to me.” “This school helps the community,” agreed one of her classmates, Zymere Ward. “It gives students the education to go further in life.” Crystal Covington, the elementary school vice principal, chaperoned the march and praised students for taking part.

“I told them that I am so proud of them all and I will be with them to the last day,” said Covington, who was joined during the protesting parade by Cathy Davis, the elementary school attendance counselor and sixth grade teachers Chris Mitchell, Heather Pawski, Aaliyah Woodson and Rasheemah Ward. “If we have not taught them anything, we taught them to advocate in what they believe in,” Covington added. PETITION TO ‘SAVE THE SCHOOL’ Hundreds of people have also signed an online petition to “Save University Heights Charter School.” The petition reads:

“We, the undersigned Caregivers, Families, Administrative Staff, Teaching Staff and District Office Administrators, ask for your support as we appeal the New Jersey State Department of Education’s decision to revoke University Heights Charter School’s Charter on June 30, 2022. The information contained in Commissioner Allen-McMillian’s report does not reflect the positive growth University Heights Charter School has made over the past two years. Data driven evidence is an essential aspect to the growth of any organization.” Since the appointment of new leadership and staff in 2020, the school has seen several positive developments, the petition claims: ""Lead school through Pandemic & Continued Instruction""

""Zero Harassment, Intimation, and Bully Reports / Safe & Healthy Learning Environments""

""Licensed Teaching Staff""

""Free Before & After School Care Programs""

""Social & Emotional Learning Initiatives for Scholars & Staff""

""Free Supplemental Educational Programs for Scholars""

""Appointment of Parent Board of Trustees""

""Parent Academy Workshops""

""Grand Opening of New Junior High School Library""

""Literacy Initiative- Summer Reading Kick off Celebration- Free Books for All Scholars"" The petition concludes: “We are asking our families to stand strong with us to protect University Heights Charter School's 16-year legacy. It is not in the best interest of our 700 scholars who already have been impacted socially and emotionally to bear the cross of Post Pandemic test scores and inherited previous school administration choices. Our scholars deserved the opportunity to show their growth and talents. UHCS staff work tirelessly ‘To educate our scholars and support our families.’ Please help us save our school.” ENROLLMENT Meanwhile, UHCS has partnered with My Schools Newark to help place students in new schools by September. A representative from My Schools Newark will hold two events at the University Heights Charter School Elementary School campus on Tuesday, June 14 for PK to 4th grades, and Thursday, June 16 for 5th to 8th grades.",Q2

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WLNE) — The Rhode Island General Assembly passed a bill on Thursday that would allow K-9 officers to receive emergency medical treatment if they are injured at a scene.

“Police dogs are some of the most loyal, untiring public servants there are. They protect and serve the public alongside human officers, sometimes at great risk to their own lives and safety,” said Rep. David Bennett, who is one of the bill’s sponsors.

The Rhode Island House approved the bill in a vote last month.

Massachusetts recently passed a similar bill called “Nero’s Law.” It’s named after Yarmouth K-9 Nero, who was shot along with his handler Officer Sean Gannon, while serving an arrest warrant.

Gannon, who was from New Bedford, was killed but Nero survived.

Rhode Island’s version of the bill would allow injured police dogs to receive EMT care and to be taken to a veterinary hospital by ambulance. The current law only allows people to get that type of care.

The bill will now go to Gov. Dan McKee’s desk to be signed into law.",Q2

""Springfield is wild,"" said Hippos Cannabis CEO Nick Rinella.

Six days after opening the doors to their Springfield location, Hippos Cannabis, located on South Glenestone Avenue, got a surprise when at about 10 a.m. a Tesla SUV jumped the curb outside the business and crashed into the front doors of the building.

""That's one way to beat the line on 4/20,"" the business wrote in the caption after sharing security camera footage of the crash on Instagram.

Rinella said besides damage to the entrance area of the store as well as to the car in the parking spot next to the Tesla, there was no other damage and there were no injuries.

The Springfield Police Department classified the incident as a ""non-injury"" accident, but a full report from the department is not yet complete.

April 20, also known as 4/20, is one of the biggest days of the year for their business, Rinella said, adding that he had only been at the Springfield location to make sure things went smoothly (the business also has locations in Chesterfield and a location in Columbia is set to open soon).

""Instead of running into a problem,"" Rinella said. ""A problem ran into us, literally.""

More:Could this year's 4/20 be the last without legal recreational marijuana in Missouri?

Rinella said the dispensary is still open and operational, adding that only the front set of doors was damaged. He estimated it would cost between $5,000 and $10,000 to fix the building.

""This is a big day for us,"" he said. ""A little more exciting than we had planned, though.""

http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/why-are-so-many-mysterious-fires-happening-at-food-processing-facilities-all-across-the-united-states/,Why Are So Many Mysterious Fires Happening At Food Processing Facilities All Across The United States?,"Everyone can see that something really strange appears to be happening, and now even Tucker Carlson is talking about it on television. For months, unusual fires have been erupting at important food industry facilities all over America. Last Thursday, I put together a list of 16 major fires that have occurred just since the start of the year. Unfortunately, since I wrote that article a couple more “mysterious incidents” have taken place. Very early on Saturday, firefighters were called out to battle a fire at a General Mills facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa…

An early morning fire at General Mills led first responders to the roof of the company to attack the flames from above. The call came in around 3:45am on Saturday at the plant located at 4800 Edgewood Road SW. First responders discovered hot spots where a vent stack makes contact with the roof. Steam and smoke were already visible. Crews reached the roof and confirmed the location of the fire below them with the help of thermal imaging. Firefighters removed roofing material and found the flames working their way through the ceiling and traveling with the vent stack.

Oddly, this fire erupted less than 48 hours after a plane crashed at a General Mills facility in Covington, Georgia…

Investigators spent Friday at the General Mills plant in Covington combing through the wreckage of a deadly plane crash that happened the previous evening. A twin-engine Cessna crashed into several semi trailers at remote part of the cereal plant on Thursday evening killing two people, the Covington Police Department said.

Is it just a “coincidence” that there were two major disasters at General Mills facilities within 48 hours of one another?

That is what some would have us believe.

Of course there have been a whole bunch of other “coincidences” happening lately too.

Less than a week ago, the headquarters of Azure Standard burned to the ground in a massive fire. CEO David Stelzer is admitting that all Azure Market liquid products will be out of stock for the foreseeable future as a result…

He also added, “For our customers, three primary product groups are affected due to the destroyed automated liquid pour facility, fruit packing facilities and carob products facilities.” He continued, “Because of this, we will experience out-of-stock status for Azure Market oils, honey and vinegars – basically any Azure Market liquid product – as well as our carob products for the short term. We are not yet at fruit harvest, so no immediate impact will be experienced from the loss of our fruit packing facility. None of the products we distribute for our vendors will be affected,” he concluded.

And just a few days before that, a “four-alarm fire” destroyed a very important food processing facility in Salinas, California…

Authorities Thursday lifted all evacuation and shelter-in-place orders in an area of Salinas where a four-alarm fire sparked a day earlier at a food processing plant, prompting fears of a possible explosion and hazardous plume of ammonia, city officials said. The fire was initially reported at about 7:15 p.m. Wednesday at the Taylor Farms processing facility on Abbott Street and prompted an order early Thursday for evacuations affecting an estimated 2,700 people and a shelter-in-place order affecting an estimated 35,000 people.

If these were isolated incidents, perhaps we never would have even taken notice of them.

But they aren’t isolated incidents.

In fact, fires have been mysteriously erupting at America’s food processing facilities for many months.

This is absolutely not coincidental. pic.twitter.com/6pJsOEGIjd — Kween JosieNN+ (@KweenJosie) April 23, 2022

Strangely, the latest fires happened during the same week that the FBI admitted that America’s farmers are now being specifically targeted by ransomware attacks…

A new warning right now for local farmers. The FBI says you need to be on alert for ransomware attacks. As KDKA money editor Jon Delano explains, those attacks on farmers could impact the rest of us at the grocery store. Whether it’s a dairy or poultry farm, a cattle farm, or a farm that grows grain, farming is a key part of Pennsylvania’s economy.

Could there be some relation between these two stories?

For now, the FBI is not saying.

And most of the talking heads on television are assuring us that there is nothing to be concerned about and that everything will be just fine.

Meanwhile, more fires continue to make the news.

On Sunday, it was being reported that “nearly a dozen wildfires” had just roared through key agricultural areas of Nebraska…

Sunday was far from a day of rest for firefighters across much of the state, as they continued to mop up nearly a dozen wildfires and remained alert for more. By Sunday morning, the Road 702 Fire in the Cambridge area covered 50,000 acres — a much larger area than the 33,000 acres burned in the April 7-9 fire in Gosper and Furnas counties. A management team from the Rocky Mountain area took command of the battle at 7 a.m. Sunday morning.

And a total of 20 wildfires are ripping across New Mexico as I write this article…

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed emergency declarations as 20 wildfires continued to burn Sunday in nearly half of the state’s drought-stricken 33 counties.

I don’t know how all of the things that I have discussed in this article tie together.

But what I do know is that all of them will have an impact on our food supply.

As I have discussed previously, UN officials are warning that we are heading into the worst global food crisis since World War II.

Do you remember when millions of people died of starvation in the 1980s and there were endless appeals on television asking us to give to the hungry?

Well, authorities are telling us that what is coming is going to be much worse than that.

A “perfect storm” of factors is combining to create the greatest stress on global food supplies that we have seen in modern times.

But most of the talking heads on television want you to believe that everything is under control and that better times are just around the corner.

You can believe them if you want, but my recommendation is to get prepared for this crisis while you still can.

Where does the case stand?,"Megan Boswell, the Sullivan County mother accused in 2020 of killing her toddler, will not stand trial until February at the earliest.

Boswell's case drew international attention after a search for 15-month-old Evelyn ended with the discovery of the child's body on family property.

Sullivan County Judge James Goodwin rescheduled the trial from Sept. 26 to Feb. 6 after a motion by Boswell's defense attorney cited ""months and months and months"" of delay in receiving test results from the state crime lab.

Here's where the trial stands.

What has happened since Boswell's arrest?

The judge heard the motion to postpone the trial on Monday. Defense attorney C. Brad Sproles argued the postponement was necessary because of a fingerprint analysis done by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

The fingerprint was found on a piece of evidence the defense attorney described as ""crucial,"" although he declined to be more specific. Sproles said he just received the test results and needs more time to have it analyzed by his own expert.

""I feel like I don't have any choice,"" Goodwin said, noting that forcing an earlier trial date could lead to a conviction being overturned.

Megan Boswell trial:She knew daughter was dead before the body was discovered, investigator says

Megan Boswell's bail remains set at $1 million. She faces a total of 19 charges, including felony murder and aggravated child abuse, and could receive a sentence of life in prison without parole.

In the two-plus years since Megan Boswell's arrest, Sproles has sought to separate the charge of filing false reports from the murder trial, in effect having a separate trial for those charges. Boswell is scheduled to be back in court in September for the hearing on separating her charges.

Sproles also has asked to change the location of the trial. That hearing is scheduled for mid-December.

Widespread coverage sparked by tale of missing toddler

Evelyn was born in November 2018 to Megan Boswell, then 17, and Ethan Perry, then 19.

Megan Boswell was living with her father and two younger siblings at the family compound in Blountville, Tennessee. Perry had joined the military a year earlier after graduating high school.

Evelyn was first reported missing in February 2020 by her grandfather, Tommy Boswell Sr., who told authorities he had not seen the child since early December 2019.

According to investigators, Megan Boswell had been telling people Evelyn was with Perry. She told investigators Perry was refusing to return texts asking about Evelyn, but she did not report her as missing to police on the advice of her mother, Angela Boswell.

Megan Boswell then changed her story multiple times, investigators said. She told investigators Angela had Evelyn and was refusing to return her. Later, she said Angela gave Evelyn to an unnamed person, and Evelyn was safe and would have a better life with that person.

Megan Boswell changed story multiple times

In late February 2020, Megan Boswell admitted to investigators Evelyn was dead but that she did not know where her body was.

Boswell told Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Special Agent David Gratz her boyfriend rolled over onto the child while they were sleeping, Gratz said in a court hearing this spring.

In early March 2020, law enforcement agents found the girl's remains inside a shed at the family compound. According to Gratz, Evelyn's body was discovered in an old playhouse that was originally built for Megan Boswell to play in when she was a child.

Megan Boswell initially was taken into custody in mid-February 2020 on a charge of lying to authorities about Evelyn's disappearance. She was charged with Evelyn's death in August 2020.

Megan Boswell is accused of killing her daughter under two separate legal theories – that the child's death resulted from an act of child abuse or from an act of child neglect. The indictment alleges Megan Boswell abused her daughter's corpse, a charge typically leveled when a body is moved and hidden in some manner.",Q2

KARACHI: A 17-year-old A-level student was killed when a large piece of concrete of a roof broke off and fell on him on main Khayaban-i-Sahar in Defence Housing Authority, Phase-VII, in presence of his parents, who remained miraculously unhurt in the incident, Dawn learnt on Sunday.

Mustafa Hashmi, student of Nixor College in the DHA, was killed on 26 Ramazan.

Speaking to Dawn, Mahmood Alam Hashmi, architect by profession, said that their life was devastated as Mustafa was their only son.

He got a portion of 500 square yards home on rent around six months ago.

The family was told to get the house repaired with their own finances, which they did.

Teen dies in his sleep when roof patch breaks off and fell on him

“I did not realise as to how much shoddy and deadly construction it was,” said the grief-stricken father.

He recalled that after Zuhr prayer on 26 Ramazan, he and wife Khadija Hashmi and their son Mustafa Hashmi were asleep in a room. His son was preparing for the A-level examinations as he had already appeared in two papers.

“When suddenly, we hear a huge sound,” said the father. He recalled that a heavy thick piece of concrete slab had fallen on them. The parents, however, remained safe. The concrete piece had fallen on the head of their son.

The chipped off roof that took on the teen’s life.

“My son died in sleep as he did not cry or utter any word,” Mr Hashmi recalled. He said he realised that their dear one was no more but they took him to Dr Ziauddin Hospital in Clifton where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.

The father complained that the private hospital refused to give them the death certificate of their son reportedly citing ‘legal complications’.

He said he took his son to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to get a death certificate where he used ‘sifarish’ (recommendation) to get the certificate prepared by the medico-legal section.

Subsequently, the coffin was taken to Chhipa morgue.

His funeral prayers took place at Masjid Khadija in DHA at night of 27 Ramazan, which were attended by relatives and others.

Mahmood Hashmi said that his son had lately started course of Hifz-i-Quran.

Substandard building construction

“My son died due to negligence; had the owner maintained its repair properly, my would have been alive today,” observed the father.

He said he might not seek legal proceedings into it, but he wanted to highlight the fact that there were many houses with substandard construction in the DHA and he did not want that whatever happened to them should happen to others.

Mahmood Hashmi said he himself was an architect by profession, but even he could not realise the shoddy construction and wondered as to how others would know that a construction was of a substandard quality.

He said he would not live anymore in the same bungalow, but he wanted that the owners before giving their house or its portion on rent to others should not do such thing and got their homes repaired properly to avoid such tragedies.

A senior police officer, whose son was a class fellow of victim Mustafa Hashmi, said that he was shocked to know when his son had informed him that his friend had died because of the some shoddy construction in DHA.

Trump’s Save America PAC sent $500,000 to a super PAC working to defeat Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom the former president has wanted out of office since he rejected Trump's request to overturn the state's 2020 presidential election results, Politico reports. Trump has endorsed former Sen. David Perdue in the May 24 Republican primary. The PAC donation marks a major change for Trump.

Until now, he's written only small checks to candidates he's backing, though donors have given Trump more than $110 million to spend. The anti-Perdue investment was described as just the first Trump donation of the campaign. It was used to pay for an ad with false claims about the 2020 election, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""If Kemp can't beat voter fraud,"" the commercial said, ""he won’t beat Stacey Abrams,"" the leading Democratic candidate, in the general election. Trump has held a rally for Perdue and a fundraiser, and he cut his own TV commerical for him.

But Kemp has a major financial advantage. Through Tuesday, AdImpact counted Kemp and supporters as having bought or reserved campaign TV ads totaling $11.4 million, while the figure for Perdue is $2.7 million. Polls show Kemp ahead by double digits, and Trump's doubts about Perdue's chances have him undecided about going back to Georgia for another rally, per Politico.

https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/why-is-atlanta-pride-in-october-instead-of-june,Why is Atlanta Pride in October instead of June?,"June is National Pride Month, and LGBTIQA+ organizations are hosting events for community support and to raise money for causes that affect their communities.

Atlanta, notably, holds some pride events in June, such as the Atlanta Pride Run & Walk, and some black pride events later in the summer close to Labor Day Weekend, but the signature pride event is held in October.

The Atlanta Pride Committee operates the Atlanta Pride Festival and Parade in October, but also other programs throughout the year.

NATIONAL PRIDE MONTH EVENTS TO ATTEND IN ATLANTA

Here's why Atlanta's traditions don't mirror other cities:

Why is Atlanta Pride in October?

A drought in 2008 forced the annual Atlanta Pride Festival and Parade to move from Piedmont Park. The year Atlanta Pride was held way from Piedmont Park attendance suffered, according to the Georgia Voice.

The festival moved back to the park in 2009, this time in October. In 2010, the change became permanent.

The October date coincides with National Coming Out Day, which celebrates the anniversary of the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.

Georgia residents know the temperatures in October are typically more suitable for outdoor events than in the heat of summer in June.

In 2022 the dates are for Oct. 7 to Oct. 9

Why is June National Pride Month?

On June 28, 1969, New York police raided a gay club in Greenwich Village, sparking an event called the Stonewall Riots or Stonewall Uprising. There were several violent clashes between protestors and police over the following days. The protests sparked the gay rights movement in the late 60s.

Traditionally, organizations and municipalities pay tribute to people who spoke out during those tense days by celebrating LGBTIQA+ pride in June. Because, in part, of the Stonewall riots, New York is considered the birthplace of Pride marches.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/military/story/2022-04-20/secretary-of-veterans-affairs-visits-san-diego,Secretary of Veterans Affairs highlights renaming of San Diego’s VA Medical Center during visit,"LA JOLLA — Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough highlighted challenges such as transportation support and homelessness during a visit Wednesday to the Veterans Affairs medical center in San Diego.

“We won’t rest until every vet is housed … no veteran should live homeless,” said McDonough, who served as White House chief-of-staff during the Obama administration. He said the federal government plans to move 38,000 homeless vets across the nation into permanent housing this year.

He also championed the role of women veterans, the fastest growing cohort of veterans in the VA system. The medical center was recently approved to be renamed to honor of Capt. Jennifer Moreno, an Army nurse from Logan Heights, who was killed in 2013 during a Special Operations raid in Afghanistan.

“Her story is inspiring,” said McDonough about Moreno, a highly-decorated combat veteran who was killed in action. “Her family’s commitment to this facility is awe-inducing, and importantly, her story reflects the increasingly central role that women play in the United States Armed Forces.”

President Joe Biden signed legislation in March renaming the medical center the “Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.” The formal renaming ceremony scheduled for this summer will make it the first VA medical facility in the nation to be named after a Latina veteran.

The bill was written by Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, who serves as the vice chair of the House Veterans Affairs committee and who hosted McDonough on his tour in San Diego.

“I approach my work on the Veterans Affairs committee as the proud grandson of a World War II veteran. I grew up with a deep appreciation for his service and I’m incredibly grateful for the service of American men and women around the world who’ve dedicated their lives to the same mission as my grandfather, keeping our nation safe and free,” said Levin at an afternoon news briefing about McDonough’s visit.

Rep. Levin and Secretary McDonough met earlier Wednesday with local veterans and employees at the Oceanside VA Clinic and the San Marcos Vet Center to receive feedback and “to learn about the impact of national-level decisions on local VA operations and services.”

McDonough said some challenges he heard during his conversations Wednesday included uneven authorities for transportation support within the VA system, San Diego’s tight housing market and “continuing to be able to pay providers wages where we remain competitive and where they can live at this level of cost-of-living …”

He also stressed the necessity of long-term planning given the United States’ recent extended periods of conflict.

“As we see troops mobilizing again, and as we obviously make prudent decisions to ensure we’re right-postured given the nature of challenges we face, it is true that a very deployed force continues to be under pressure, and so it’s only prudent, but it’s also our solemn obligation to prepare to care for all those people,” said McDonough.

Three live-action prequel series are already in the works — including “House of the Dragon,” which hits screens this August — as well as three animated prequels.

But the purported Jon Snow series would be the first to be set after the events of smash hit “Game of Thrones,” which bowed out with a deeply divisive final season in 2019.

While several major characters died, Snow — who was revealed to be Aegon Targaryen, a potential heir to the Iron Throne — left Westeros in exile, headed for the icy and wild North.

His character had already been brought back from death after being betrayed earlier in the show’s run.

News of the possible spin-off drew mixed reaction from fans online, with some delighted to see more of arguably the standout character from “Thrones,” and others questioning the logic of picking up from the original show’s disappointing finale.

“Bro just re-do the last season at this point… We ain’t gonna get mad at you and you get to make all that money again and have a chance at a competent ending,” said one popular post on Reddit.

During its eight-year run from 2011, “Thrones” was a global phenomenon, scooping a record 59 Emmys with its warring families and fire-breathing dragons, medieval violence and non-stop sex.

Martin signed a five-year deal with HBO in 2021, reportedly worth “mid-eight figures” in dollars, to develop shows both within and beyond the “Thrones” universe.",Q2
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/top-10-international-anti-corruption-1315028/,Top 10 International Anti-Corruption Developments for May 2022,"Designed for busy in-house counsel, compliance professionals, and anti-corruption lawyers, this newsletter summarizes some of the most important international anti-corruption developments from the past month, with links to primary resources. This month we ask: Which company agreed to pay over a billion dollars to resolve foreign bribery and market manipulation claims involving Africa and South America? Are administrative proceedings brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) constitutional? Which U.S. properties were the subject of forfeiture actions for ties to foreign bribery? The answers to these questions and more are here in our May 2022 Top 10 list.

1. Swiss Commodities Trader Resolves Foreign Bribery Allegations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Brazil

On May 24, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Glencore International A.G., a multi-national commodity trading and mining firm headquartered in Switzerland, and certain of its subsidiaries, had reached coordinated foreign-bribery and market-manipulation resolutions with criminal and civil authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Brazil, including by agreeing to plead guilty in the Southern District of New York to one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Also on May 24, 2022, the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced that it had charged the company’s UK subsidiary with bribery and failure to prevent bribery under the UK Bribery Act (UKBA). According to the U.S. agencies, the companies paid more than $100 million to third-party intermediaries, while intending that a significant portion of those payments would be used to pay bribes to officials in Brazil, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Venezuela in order to gain business advantages such as obtaining favorable terms from national oil companies and reducing liabilities related to government audits. The SFO also alleged bribery in South Sudan. In total, the companies will pay a combined total of $1.1 billion pursuant to the DOJ and CFTC resolutions, subject to certain offsets for payments eventually made pursuant to the UK resolution and any potential resolution with Swiss authorities. The company also agreed to pay approximately $39.6 million under a resolution signed with the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor's Office (MPF). In July 2021, Anthony Stimler, a former UK-based trader for Glencore, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and to commit money laundering in relation to the Nigeria allegations.

2. U.S. Appellate Court Finds SEC Administrative Proceedings Unconstitutional

As we have discussed in previous Top 10s, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) typically brings settled FCPA enforcement actions as administrative proceedings, rather than filing civil complaints in U.S. district courts. Thus, although not an FCPA case, the May 18, 2022 ruling by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Jarkesy v. SEC, holding SEC’s use of its in‑house judges to be unconstitutional, is potentially significant for FCPA enforcement. Jarkesy stems from a 2013 administrative proceeding against fund manager George Jarkesy and his funds’ investment adviser, Patriot28. Jarkesy and the adviser were found to have defrauded investors by inflating the value of fund assets, thereby increasing incentive fees. In its 2013 order, the SEC imposed civil penalties, among other remedies. After the SEC rejected respondents’ constitutional challenges to the Administrative Law Judge’s (ALJ) authority, they petitioned the Fifth Circuit for review. The Jarkesy majority held that: (1) SEC’s use of in-house administrative proceedings violated a defendant’s Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial; (2) Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative powers to SEC without an intelligible principle by which to use that legislative power; and (3) ALJs were unconstitutionally insulated from removal in violation of the Take Care Clause of Article II of the Constitution. This decision appears to create a circuit split with numerous other courts who had rejected similar challenges to SEC’s use of ALJs. Jarkesy may not have a major impact on typical FCPA enforcement—to date, all FCPA enforcement actions brought as administrative proceedings have been negotiated resolutions in which the defendants have expressly admitted to the Commission’s jurisdiction—but it could limit SEC’s options in bringing contested enforcement actions. (For more on Jarkesy, see our client alert.)

3. Former Venezuelan Treasurer Extradited From Spain to Face Money Laundering Charges in the United States

On May 13, 2022, former Venezuelan national treasurer Claudia Patricia Díaz Guillén was extradited from Spain to the United States to face money laundering charges related to her alleged participation in a billion dollar currency and money laundering scheme. DOJ first announced charges against Díaz in December 2020, alleging that she and another former Venezuelan national treasurer, Alejandro Andrade Cedeno, had received bribes from Venezuelan media magnate Raul Gorrin Belisario in exchange for allowing his company to conduct foreign exchange transactions at favorable rates. In October 2021, Spain’s National Court rejected Díaz’s argument that she could sufficiently respond to the charges in Spain and approved her extradition to the United States. On May 24, 2022, Díaz pleaded not guilty in the Southern District of Florida.

4. Sons of Former Panamanian President Sentenced for Money Laundering Offenses

On May 20, 2022, DOJ announced that Luis and Ricardo Martinelli Linares, the sons of former Panama president Ricardo Martinelli, were sentenced in the Eastern District of New York to 36 months’ imprisonment and ordered to forfeit more than $18.8 million following their December 2021 guilty pleas to conspiring to launder $28 million in connection with a bribery scheme involving a Brazilian construction company. DOJ first announced money-laundering charges against Luis and Ricardo, as well as their arrests in Guatemala, in July 2020, and the two were extradited to the United States in November and December 2021, respectively.

5. Convicted Financial Adviser’s Sentence Reduced for Cooperation in Ecuador Bribery Investigation

On May 6, 2022, Southern District of Florida Judge Marcia Cooke granted DOJ’s motion for a reduction of sentence for Frank Roberto Chatburn Ripalda, who pleaded guilty in October 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with a scheme to disguise bribe payments to officials of Ecuadorian state-owned oil company Petroecuador and was sentenced to 42 months’ imprisonment in December 2019. According to DOJ, Chatburn provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of several individuals. Judge Cooke reduced Chatburn’s sentence to time served.

6. DOJ Secures Civil Asset Forfeiture in Connection with Former Gambian President’s Bribery Scheme

On May 26, 2022, DOJ announced that it had secured the forfeiture of a property in Potomac, Maryland, allegedly acquired by a trust associated with the former President of the Gambia, Yahya Jammeh, with the proceeds of corruption. In July 2020, DOJ announced that it had filed a civil complaint in the District of Maryland, seeking forfeiture of a property in Potomac, Maryland that had been acquired with proceeds allegedly derived from illicit bribes and stolen public funds misappropriated by Jammeh and his wife. According to the complaint, during his over 20 years in office, Jammeh corruptly obtained millions of dollars by embezzling public funds and soliciting bribes from businesses seeking to obtain monopoly rights over various sectors of the Gambian economy, including petroleum imports and telecommunication and internet services. The complaint alleges that the Potomac property was purchased for $3.5 million in 2010 using tainted funds. According to the DOJ press release, the United States intends to sell the property and use the net proceeds to benefit victims of Jammeh’s corruption in Gambia.

7. DOJ Files Civil Forfeiture Complaint Alleging Corruption by Former Armenian Finance Minister

On May 2, 2022, DOJ announced that it had filed a civil forfeiture complaint seeking the forfeiture of a more than 30,000-square-foot “mega-mansion” in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles that was allegedly purchased with bribes paid by an Armenian businessman to the family of Gagik Khachatryan, who served as Chairman of the State Revenue Committee of the Republic of Armenia from 2008 to 2014 and as Minister of Finance for the Republic of Armenia from 2014 to 2016. According to DOJ, Khachatryan, also known as the “Super Minister,” illegally used his influence to reduce tax liabilities of businesses affiliated with Sedrak Arustamyan, an executive at Multi Group, an Armenian conglomerate. In exchange, Arustamyan is alleged to have entered into $20.4 million in sham loan agreements with Khachatryan’s sons between 2009 and 2011. Khachatryan and his sons allegedly used trust companies to disguise these illegal payments and to purchase the “mega-mansion” for $14.4 million in 2011.

8. UK Regulator Sanctions KPMG for Inadequate Audit Procedures

On May 24, 2022, the Financial Reporting Council, the UK agency responsible for regulating auditors and accountants, sanctioned KMPG Audit plc (KPMG) and one of its Audit Engagement Partners in connection with the firm’s audit of Rolls-Royce Group plc (Rolls-Royce) accounts. KPMG’s audit of Rolls-Royce’s 2010 accounts identified two sets of payments made by Rolls-Royce to agents in India. The UK Serious Fraud Office later brought bribery and corruption charges against Rolls-Royce based in part on these payments, resulting in a $604.8 million fine in January 2017, at the time the largest British fine ever imposed on a company for criminal conduct. The Financial Reporting Council levied nearly £3.5 million ($4.4 million) in fines on KMPG and the Audit Engagement Partner, issued a severe reprimand, and required that KPMG commission an external review of its policies for audit work in the area of the audited entity’s legal and regulatory compliance.

9. Mining Corporation Loses Arbitration Following Israeli Owner’s Corruption Conviction

On May 18, 2022, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, an international arbitration organization, issued an award in favor of Guinea and against BSG Resources Ltd. (BSG), which had claimed billions in damages after Guinea canceled an iron ore mining concession. BSG, a mining company controlled by Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz, alleged that Guinea expropriated the mine. The arbitration panel, however, sided with Guinea, apparently finding that BRG used shell companies to pay at least $9.4 million in bribes during 2006-2010 to Mamadie Touré, a wife of former Guinean president Lansana Conté, in a corrupt bid to obtain mining licenses. (The award remains confidential pending agreement of the parties on redactions.) The arbitration award follows Steinmetz’s January 2021 conviction by the Criminal Court of Geneva of corruption and forgery in connection with this bribery scheme. The Court sentenced Steinmetz to five years in prison and a fine of 50 million Swiss francs ($56 million).

10. Guatemalan Attorney General Blocked from Entering the United States Due to Corruption

On May 16, 2022, the U.S. Department of State announced that it had designated the Attorney General of Guatemala, Maria Consuelo Porras Argueta de Porras, due to her involvement in significant corruption. According to the State Department, Porras repeatedly obstructed and undermined anticorruption investigations in Guatemala to protect her political allies and gain undue political favor, including by ordering prosecutors in Guatemala’s Public Ministry to ignore cases based on political considerations and firing prosecutors who investigate cases involving acts of corruption. As we previously reported, in July 2021, Porras removed the head of the Guatemalan Special Prosecutor’s Office Against Impunity (FECI), a move which the Biden administration characterized as part of a systematic effort to weaken the fight against corruption in Guatemala and resulted in the suspension of cooperation between the United States and the Guatemalan attorney general’s office. As a result of being designated, Porras and her immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States.

Mississippi Clarion Ledger

BRANDON, Miss. (AP) — A man wanted in a Florida kidnapping took his own life Monday after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement officers in central Mississippi, a sheriff said.

Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey told news outlets that the man was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 20 near Brandon, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) east of Mississippi's capital city of Jackson.

Bailey said deputies discovered after they had stopped the man that he was wanted in Florida for kidnapping and was considered armed and dangerous.

Bailey said the man and the deputies exchanged gunfire before the man fatally shot himself. Authorities did not immediately release his name.

Bailey said two children in the man's car were not hurt, and no deputies were injured.

On Saturday (May 14), the 17-year-old alleged shooter killed a 16-year-old after firing at the victim's chest. In total, 26 minors and five adults were reportedly arrested during the fatal gathering at The Bean -- eight guns were confiscated, and five gun arrests were made.

The 17-year-old has now been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, and aggravated battery. He was taken into custody Saturday evening and is due in juvenile court on Monday (May 16).

A curfew at the Chicago tourist site has been instated following Saturday's fatal incident. On Sunday (May 15), officials said minors wouldn't be allowed at The Bean after 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays without an adult.

According to ABC News, it's currently unknown how the curfew will be enforced.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement, “We must also have zero tolerance for young people carrying firearms or settling petty disputes with acts of violence."" Lightfoot added, “We all must condemn this behavior in the strongest terms possible.”

Before the shooting, hundreds of people took part in demonstrations against the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion at the mirrored sculpture. It is unknown whether anyone involved in the fatal incident was present for the 1 p.m. demonstration.

""It's time to act. We can do so much more,"" Mr Biden said.

He said the shooting suspect, a local teenager, was also ""deceased,"" adding that ""it is believed that responding officers killed him."" Police said that the suspect acted alone.

The attack happened at Robb Elementary School in the town of Uvalde, Texas, about 100km west of San Antonio. The small community is also about an hour from the Mexican border.

A police press conference said the victims came from grades two, three and four. Children in these classes are typically aged between six and nine years old.

Official details on the circumstances of the midday shooting (local time) remained sketchy in the immediate aftermath of the violence.

The student body at the school consists of children in the second, third and fourth grades, according to Pete Arredondo, chief of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Department, who also addressed reporters.

Uvalde Memorial Hospital said on Facebook that 13 children had been transferred there for treatment. It said two were deceased on arrival.

University Hospital in San Antonio said on Twitter it had received two patients from the shooting, one child and one adult.

Both patients, a 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl, were listed in critical condition.

Mr Biden spoke by phone with Mr Abbott, and the White House Communications Director said that the US President offered any assistance needed following the shooting.

The shooting is the deadliest such incident in the US since 14 high school students and three adult staff were killed in Parkland, Florida in 2018.

It is the worst at an elementary (primary) school since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut, in which 20 children and six staff were killed.

Despite recurring mass-casualty shootings and a nationwide wave of gun violence, multiple initiatives to reform gun regulations have failed in the US Congress, leaving states and local councils to enact their own restrictions.

The National Rifle Association has been instrumental in fighting against stricter US gun laws. Mr Abbott and Mr Cruz are listed as speakers at a forum that is being held by the powerful lobby in Houston, Texas later this week.

The email came on the heels of the tragic shooting Tuesday when a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Musk's point mirrors a years-long debate in media circles regarding how much attention is given to mass murderers, as their horrific acts are newsworthy but many feel they are out for attention and infamy.

Musk’s attorney and Tesla’s press team did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.

TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING: WHO ARE THE VICTIMS KILLED AT UVALDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

Officials did not immediately reveal a motive for the elementary school massacre, but they identified the assailant as 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, a resident of Uvalde. Law enforcement officials said Ramos acted alone and was killed by a Border Patrol agent who rushed into the school without waiting for backup.

The assault at Robb Elementary School was the deadliest shooting at a U.S. grade school since a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.

Musk added, ""I strongly believe that the right to bear arms is an important safeguard against potential tyranny of government. Historically, maintaining their power over the people is why those in power did not allow public ownership of guns.""

Last week, Musk claimed that he will be voting for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections.

During a live episode of the All-In Podcast at a Miami tech conference, Musk told his hosts that he would be voting Republican in the upcoming elections despite his track record of almost exclusively voting Democrat.

https://www.njherald.com/story/news/new-jersey/2022/06/24/nj-abortion-providers-protests-supreme-court-roe-v-wade-dobbs/7637712001/,Abortion providers in NJ worry they will face more protests after Supreme Court ruling,"Outside the doors of the Metropolitan Medical Associates clinic in Englewood, a man shouted into a microphone headset, “You don’t have to murder your child; every child is a blessing,” as a volunteer wearing a brightly colored pink vest ushered a patient into the building on Saturday.

A similar scene plays out each weekend at the Englewood clinic, one of the oldest and largest in New Jersey.

Now, with the Supreme Court's new ruling handed down Friday that ends the federally protected right to abortion codified by the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, abortion providers, clinic volunteers and reproductive rights activists throughout New Jersey fear protesters may become emboldened by what they view as a long-sought victory.

Given the new ruling that leaves abortion rules up to each state, roughly half the states in the country are likely to ban abortion or dramatically restrict the procedure. New Jersey, with some of the strongest laws in the nation protecting the right to abortion, is expected to see an increase in patients traveling here to seek an abortion.

The ruling could also bring more out-of-state protesters looking for a new venue to target as clinics inother states shut their doors.

“We don’t have quiet Saturdays here anymore. It can be pretty chaotic,” said Andrea Long, a director of the clinic escort program at Metropolitan Medical Associates. “We have people who can be incredibly loud and angry and yell some really offensive things. Once the decision comes down and bans start passing, we’re expecting more to come.”

In Cherry Hill, the other New Jersey clinic with a volunteer escort program, people opposed to abortion show up daily. Whenever abortion is central in the news or new legislation is announced, their numbers grow, said Roxanne Sutocky, the director of community engagement for The Women’s Centers, a group of clinics in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Georgia.

“This will really be seen as a win, so that’s something that will galvanize people and bring them out,” she said, adding that Cherry Hill is also preparing for an influx of out-of-state protesters. “All clinics have regular protesters. We expect folks will be looking for new targets.""

Live Updates:Scenes from New Jersey after Supreme Court strikes down Roe vs. Wade

The Englewood clinic has been a focal point for demonstrators since it opened in 1973, shortly after the Roe v. Wade ruling in January of that year.

It was founded by Robert Livingston, an obstetrician and outspoken advocate for reproductive rights who once held a press conference to say he was performing illegal abortions at his practice. That announcement earned him an indictment, which was dropped six months later when Roe was decided.

Decades ago, people would block the clinic’s entrance by stepping in buckets of concrete and letting them dry, said Long, the clinic escort director. Activists chained themselves together outside and bolted the clinic's door shut. Police arrested protesters by the dozens.

Over the years, their numbers ebbed and flowed, but by 2014 the protester presence at the clinic had grown so disruptive that the Englewood City Council adopted an ordinance barring people from coming within 8 feet of its entrance.

“You had these protesters, a lot of men standing outside screaming and carrying on, yelling ‘Murderers, murderers.’ It was pretty outrageous,” said Bonnie Shapiro, then the president of the Northern New Jersey National Organization for Women, which had lobbied the council to take action. “Once the buffer zone went into effect, things became much more civil.”

But in 2017 a judge struck down the law after it was challenged by an abortion opponent who claimed the buffer zone violated her First Amendment rights. It was put back in place, at least temporarily, in 2019 when an appeals court sent the lawsuit back to a lower court. That case is pending, and a decision is expected sometime this summer, Long said.

“I am concerned that the combination of the Supreme Court ruling and losing the buffer zone could be really difficult to manage,” she said. “A lot of us who do this sort of work, we’re trying to take it one day at a time. All we can do is take care of the patients right now and face whatever challenges may come.”

Saturday morning, a half dozen picketers stood outside the Engle Street clinic, holding signs depicting images of aborted fetuses that read “This is not health care” and “Abortion is murder.” Many wore headsets to amplify their message through speakers and had cameras strapped to their chests, a necessity, they said, to protect themselves against false complaints of harassment.

“Unfortunately, we have a lot of dishonesty around here. It can get hostile,” said Robert, a protester who declined to give his last name. “I can’t comprehend why someone would want to take another life. We have couples lined up right now who would love to adopt a child.”

A man from Elmwood Park who gave the name Randy called the imminent Supreme Court decision a “step in the right direction” and said he would continue his weekly visits to the clinic.

“This is the hardest place to go. People hate us. I’d rather be home sleeping,” he said. “But these babies are precious in God’s eyes. That’s our validation. That’s why we’re here.”

The protesters said they hoped to change the minds of people planning to terminate pregnancies with offers of free baby showers and financial and emotional support.

But clinic volunteers said the protesters can be intimidating, particularly for people already struggling with a difficult decision.

Long said she and other volunteers have filed roughly a dozen complaints over the past year for harassment and buffer zone violations.

More:In a post-Roe era, the internet could help or hurt women seeking abortions. Here's how.

In November, a Bergenfield man was arrested for allegedly blocking the way as a volunteer escort and patient approached the clinic’s front door. Protesters are free to speak their minds but cannot under federal law obstruct access to a clinic.

Since 2015, when a mass shooting inside a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic killed three people and injured nine, violence by abortion opponents has been on the rise.

The National Abortion Federation, which has tracked statistics on incidents of violence and disruption against abortion providers for more than four decades, found that in 2020, the most recent year of available statistics, there was a notable increase in death threats to providers, reports of assaults outside clinics and an escalation in aggressive behavior from protesters.

“We’ve seen more and more that protesters are willing to resort to violence,” said Anjali Mehrotra, the president of the National Organization for Women of New Jersey. “This is always a concern for people who work at clinics, patients and clinic escorts.""

A proposal by Gov. Phil Murphy to expand protections for reproductive rights includes $5 million for security for abortion providers.

Clinics that perform second trimester abortions, such as the ones in Englewood and Cherry Hill, are more likely to be the subject of protests, Mehrotra said. Protesters also tend to gravitate toward facilities on busy roads where people driving past will notice.

Melissa Fowler, the National Abortion Federation's chief program officer, said the organization provides security training to clinics and is preparing for an increase in protests and harassment. Since the Supreme Court draft leak, there has been an uptick in online activity alluding to threats to providers, she said, and members have reported protesters becoming more aggressive.

“We know that political victories can embolden the people who want to harass and terrorize abortion providers. We’ve seen that in the past,” she said. “We do anticipate that clinics who remain open might see a more concentrated effort from people who previously targeted clinics in other states.”

Protesters rarely change the minds of people seeking to end their pregnancies, but it is stressful for patients to walk through a gauntlet of shouting protesters before undergoing a medical procedure, Sutocky said.

“The harassment and shaming that happens outside of clinics doesn’t typically discourage people from having abortions, but it does create undue and significant distress,” she said. “This is something that unfortunately all of our patients have to deal with and that’s really unfair.”

Ruud's trial is set to begin on Monday and run through Wednesday. It is being held in Greene County and is being presided over by Greene County Judge Calvin Holden, who is set to begin retirement on July 31.

Court proceedings in Leckie's death have moved slowly through the court system and even included an argument before the Missouri Supreme Court about the privilege of a recording where Ruud allegedly admitted to some of the crimes.

Before the attorneys make their opening statements, here's look back on what happened so far in the case.

In July of 2017, Leckie was reported missing from her mother's farm in Ozark County. Ruud, who was Leckie's biological mother, initially told investigators that Leckie must have run away after there was a fire on Ruud's property two days earlier for which Leckie blamed herself.

However, weeks later in early August, while investigators were scouring the property, court documents say they discovered burned bone fragments that later were confirmed to have belonged to Leckie. Leckie had only been living with Ruud for about a year after being raised by her adopted family in Minnesota.

Ruud and Peat got married the day the bones were discovered. They were indicted by a grand jury in September of 2017.

They were both charged with first-degree murder for Leckie's death, as well as child abuse and felony murder. For the prosecution to prove felony murder, they merely have to prove that an underling felony took place and someone died as result. In this case, the felony is child abuse where the child died as a result of the abuse.

Throughout the investigation of this case, officials say they uncovered evidence that Rudd had severely abused Leckie; including incidents where Rudd rubbed salt and alcohol in Leckie's wounds, made her roll around in a pigpen and bathe in a muddy pond.

Ruud and Peat are also charged with abandoning a corpse and tampering with physical evidence.

Court proceedings have dragged on since 2017 in part due to a dispute over a piece of evidence that made its way up to the Missouri Supreme and was finally settled last year.

More:Missouri Supreme Court says recording with attorney can be used against Ozark County murder suspect Rebecca Ruud

The evidence in question was a recording made by Ruud in 2017 when she was at the public defender's office before she was even indicted or charged with a crime. In the recording, she allegedly admitted to a number of the crimes for which she was accused.

Normally such a recording would fall under attorney-client privilege, but after making the recording Ruud put it in a box and gave it to her husband, Peat, who didn't listen to it for over a year. However, once he did listen to it, Peat turned it over to the police.

Ruud and her attorneys argued that the recording could not be used as evidence by the prosecution because it was privileged, a claim that Judge Holden agreed with when he ruled on the issue.

However, prosecutors claimed Ruud forfeited privilege when she gave the recording to Peat. They appealed the issue to the Missouri Supreme Court, which unanimously sided with prosecutors in a decision from last November.

The recording will presumably be a major part of the evidence presented at the trial, though at the time of the Missouri Supreme Court's ruling in November, Ozark County Prosecuting Attorney John Garrabrant said he still did not know exactly what was on the recording.

The trial is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. Monday at the Greene County courthouse.

“God just puts you in the right place at the right time.” That’s the message from one of the good Samaritans who jumped into action over the weekend to try saving the lives of a couple trapped inside a burning Texas home.

The harrowing incident unfolded around 10:40 a.m. Sunday when burglar bars kept the couple stuck inside the house,” KTRK-TV reported.

Listen to the latest episode of the Faithwire podcast

As flames raged, two men happened to be on their way to the barber when they heard one of the trapped individuals yelling for help.

“I saw him standing at the burglar bar. My barber pulled his truck down, put the chain on the burglar bar, and snatched him out,” one of the good Samaritans proclaimed. “I tried to go in and get the wife. But the smoke and flames were too hot.”

The second hero who helped at the scene said he was “crying” amid their inability to rescue the woman, reportedly in her 60s.

Tragically, she later died at a local hospital, but the man trapped with her — who was given CPR at the scene — is expected to survive.

Neither hero wished to be named, but Houston Fire Deputy Chief Douglas Harrison praised their quick-thinking actions for helping save the life of the man.

“They definitely stepped up and helped the problem,” he said. “They didn’t just sit back and watch.”

Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire. Pray for the man who survived and all those involved.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1696174/authorities-demolishing-upper-portions-of-houses-near-us-consulate,Authorities demolishing upper portions of houses near US Consulate in Karachi,"KARACHI: Five people were taken into custody for resisting the demolition of seven residential buildings in Sultanabad near the US Consulate, police said on Wednesday.

The Karachi Bachao Tehreek, an alliance of several political and civil society organisations, was protesting against the demolition of houses around three major drains in the metropolis.

It said that working-class residents of Sultanabad near the US Consulate had been arrested for ‘peacefully protesting’ against the demolition of their homes.

KBT convenor Khurram Nayar told Dawn that on Monday night, the deputy commissioner of Keamari, Mukhtiar Abro, asked the residents to vacate their houses because the same would be demolished in view of ‘security concerns’ to the foreign mission.

Police arrest five protesters; DC says ‘high-rise’ buildings built illegally on small plots

Mr Nayar claimed that the residents had already obtained a stay order from the Sindh High Court a week ago.

Despite this, the demolition of seven residential buildings started on Tuesday under the supervision of the area deputy commissioner.

He said some of the residents tried to film the demolition work and ran towards their homes when the law-enforcers took action but the police detained five of them in the evening.

They were initially taken to the Jackson police station where the activists reached. Subsequently, they were taken to the Docks police station where a case was registered against them on charges of “attempted murder, riots and encounter with the police”.

The KBT chief added the held citizens were presented before a concerned court, which remanded them in police custody for two days.

Mr Khurram claimed that the authorities were destroying the residential buildings because of a ‘perceived security threat’ to the UC consulate general.

He said that the residents had constructed the buildings and they had got layout plans approved by the authorities concerned besides two officials of the consulate had also visited and reportedly ‘gave’ an approval for construction activities some years ago.

On the other hand, DC-Keamari Abro told Dawn that seven high-rise buildings had been built on small plots, which were ‘illegal’.

“These structures were threat to life of people, therefore, they are being demolished,” the DC said, adding that the SHC had not given any stay order.

“We will not dispossess the residents, but upper storeys [of their houses] will be demolished,” the DC added.

Keamari SSP Fida Husain Janwari said five people were arrested after they had resisted the ‘anti-encroachment drive’ and had been booked.

The officer added that the police were there to provide protection to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), anti-encroachment and revenue department officials.

The SSP said as per DC Keamari, these seven buildings were ‘illegal’, therefore they were being demolished.

He said the DC had also told the police that the stay order had been vacated. Therefore, the anti-encroachment drive was launched on Tuesday and continued till Wednesday, he added.

MESA COUNTY, Colo. — In Colorado, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of the most polarizing members of Congress, is trying to beat back a challenge from a more mainstream Republican in her primary Tuesday.

Two Republican House incumbents from Mississippi are facing primary runoffs to keep their seats, including one who voted in favor of a commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

In Illinois, Republican Rep. Mary Miller, who called the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade a “historic victory for white life” during a rally with former President Donald Trump — her spokesperson said she misspoke — is going up against a fellow GOP incumbent.

A total of six states are holding congressional primary elections, primary runoffs or special elections on Tuesday. Many of the Republican races will test Trump's national influence, and others could provide the first hints of how voters are reacting to the high court's decision on abortion.

Some of the top elections:

BOEBERT’S STAYING POWER

Boebert, a first-term firebrand, saw her GOP-leaning 3rd Congressional District in western Colorado become even more Republican after redistricting. She faces moderate state Rep. Don Coram, a rancher and hemp farmer, who slams what he calls Boebert’s extremism.

Coram argues that the incumbent’s fealty to Trump has meant neglect of her sprawling territory’s all-important agriculture issues as she seeks social and conservative media celebrity. Boebert has railed against the “Biden regime” and “socialist” Democrats. She also trumpets her gun-toting Second Amendment credentials and opposition to COVID-19 restrictions that briefly shuttered her “Shooters” restaurant.

Boebert criticizes Coram for working with legislative Democrats. Her opponent is betting voters alienated by Boebert’s provocations will choose someone more in the tradition of centrists that have played well in the area, including five-term Republican Rep. Scott Tipton, who lost to Boebert in an upset last cycle.

Also Tuesday, in Colorado’s deeply conservative El Paso County, eight-term Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn faces a challenge from the right from state Rep. Dave Williams for his 5th Congressional District seat. Williams failed to get the phrase “Let’s Go Brandon,” code for an obscenity against Biden, added to his name on the ballot.

Lamborn, who faces an ongoing House ethics investigation over whether he misused official resources for personal purposes, has survived primary challenges in the past as an ardent opponent of abortion and backer of the significant U.S. military presence in Colorado Springs. Earlier this year, Williams led a 24-hour filibuster in the statehouse over a bill allowing unrestricted access to abortion. The bill eventually became law.

ILLINOIS INCUMBENTS CLASH

Miller, first elected in 2020, is no stranger to controversy. She quoted Adolf Hitler shortly after winning her seat, saying during a rally that “Hitler was right on one thing. He said, ‘Whoever has the youth has the future.’” She later apologized after Democrats in Illinois called for her resignation. She also voted against certifying Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election and is a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus..

On Saturday night, she made the “white life” comment as Trump stood behind her at a rally in Mendon, drawing cheers from the crowd. Miller has since said she's not racist, and her spokesperson said she had intended to say the ruling was a victory for the “right to life.”

She is facing five-term Republican Rep. Rodney Davis on Tuesday for the GOP nomination for the 15th Congressional District, a sprawling, heavily red district in central Illinois that was redrawn after the state's shrinking population cost it a congressional seat.

Davis was a co-chair of Trump’s 2020 Illinois campaign but voted to certify the 2020 presidential election results. He has the backing of almost all of the district’s 35 county party chairs and has vowed to “reimplement” Trump policies, including walling off the U.S.-Mexico border.

In suburban Chicago, meanwhile, redistricting means both Democratic Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman are running for the state's 6th Congressional District, a blue-leaning seat.

Newman is a progressive first elected in 2020, when she defeated longtime Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of Congress’ last anti-abortion Democrats. She faces an ongoing House Ethics Committee investigation over whether she promised federal employment to a political opponent.

Casten flipped a suburban seat in 2018 that Republicans held for decades.

FLOOD OF CANDIDATES FOR OPEN ILLINOIS SEATS

More than 20 candidates are vying for the chance to replace 15-term Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush, the only lawmaker who has ever beaten Barack Obama in a race. Obama challenged Rush in a 2000 U.S. House primary and lost.

The heavily Democratic 1st Congressional District was redrawn after the 2020 census and now stretches from Chicago's South Side to Kankakee.

Among the field running to replace Rush is Jonathan Jackson, the son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Karin Norington-Reaves, a federal workforce trainer endorsed by Rush; Pat Dowell, a member of the Chicago City Council whose ward is in the district; and businessman Jonathan Swain.

Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos also is not seeking reelection in the 17th Congressional District in northwestern Illinois, a largely rural swath that Republicans are hoping to flip in November.

Republican Esther Joy King, who came close to defeating Bustos in 2020, is again running for the GOP nomination and has a large fundraising lead over her primary rivals. The Democratic field includes former meteorologist Eric Sorenson, Rockford City Council member Jonathan Logemann and educator Angie Normoyle, who has served on both her local school board and county board.

TWO RARE MISSISSIPPI RUNOFFS

Republican Rep. Michael Guest is seeking a third term after voting to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Fellow GOP Rep. Steven Palazzo is seeking a seventh term after being accused in a congressional ethics report last year of abusing his office by misspending campaign funds.

Both Guest and Palazzo failed to cross the 50% threshold to win outright in their June 7 primaries. Guest now faces former Navy fighter pilot Michael Cassidy, while Palazzo is going up against Mike Ezell, the sheriff of a coastal county.

The congressional runoffs are rare. The Associated Press researched state records dating back 70 years, to 1952, and found that no U.S. representative from Mississippi had been in a party primary runoff during that time.

NEBRASKA SPECIAL ELECTION OVERLAPS WITH SENTENCING

Former Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska will face sentencing Tuesday for lying to federal agents just as voters pick a replacement for the rest of his term.

Fortenberry resigned in March after being convicted of intentionally misleading FBI agents about his knowledge of an illegal, $30,000 campaign contribution from a Nigerian billionaire at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles.

Two state lawmakers, Republican Mike Flood and Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks, are running in a special election to succeed Fortenberry, who served nine terms in the Republican-heavy district that includes Lincoln and dozens of smaller, rural communities. They'll compete again in the November to determine who serves a new term, beginning next January.

KPRC-TV is reporting that around 10:30 PM on Thursday April 21st, the Harris County Sheriff responded to a shooting at a Jack in The Box located on the north side of the county. Apparently, a customer in the drive-thru became irate when he saw that he didn’t get the sauce that he wanted with his food. The customer who was clearly upset with his order, and decided to take his frustrations out on the drive-thru worker, and began to argue with him over the sauce.

Another Jack in The Box employee who was off the clock, was standing outside and witnessed the disagreement between the customer, and the drive-thru worker. When the customer pulled out of the drive-thru, he then argued with the employee standing outside, and attempted to run him over. A female passenger who was riding in the vehicle then proceeded to pull out a gun, and fired it at the employee. As soon as she discharged the weapon, the suspects fled the scene in the vehicle.

When law enforcement arrived on the scene, the officers found the employee sitting outside the restaurant, with a gunshot wound to his hand. Fortunately, he did not receive any life-threatening injuries, and was transported by an ambulance to a local hospital.

COBB COUNTY, GA — Attorneys for a Georgia man convicted in Cobb County for murdering an 8-year-old girl and raping a 10-year-old girl in 1976 have filed a lawsuit to delay next week’s execution, according to reports.

The Georgia Department of Corrections said last month that Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. is to be put to death at 7 p.m. on May 17 at the state prison in Jackson. Presnell, 68, was convicted of abducting and attacking the two girls as they walked home from school in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, on May 4, 1976. His lawyers filed an emergency motion Monday seeking to delay the execution, reported the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.

Attorneys from three Atlanta law firms said the state’s decision to execute Presnell violates a written agreement with the state Attorney General’s Office, reported the AJC. Put in place last year, it postponed most Georgia executions until after the COVID-19 pandemic. According to WSB-TV, Presnell waited for a Cobb County elementary school to let out for the day and saw a 10-year-old girl walking home on a wooded trail. The next day he kidnapped her and her 8-year-old friend, according to evidence at trial outlined in a Georgia Supreme Court ruling, reported WSB.",Q2

He calls the incident a mistake.,"MADISON – Congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden was found with a gun in his carry-on bag at an Iowa airport last year, netting him two fines for what he called a mistake.

Details about the incident are emerging soon after U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) was cited for having a gun in a carry-on bag.

Van Orden, a Republican running to fill the seat being vacated by Democratic U.S. Rep. Ron Kind of La Crosse, was cited in August for having a loaded 9mm Sig Sauer handgun in his bag at the security screening checkpoint at the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, airport, according to court records.

Van Orden, of Prairie du Chien, entered a guilty plea in December. A magistrate ordered him to pay $360 and show he had taken a firearms safety course. He filed paperwork in April showing he had taken a class for a Wisconsin concealed weapons permit.

Separately, Van Orden was fined by the Transportation Security Administration, according to his campaign. The campaign and TSA did not provide details on the size of that fine, but TSA typically charges $4,100 for first offenses.

Van Orden declined to be interviewed, but his campaign released a statement that said he brought the gun to the airport checkpoint by mistake.

""Derrick Van Orden is a decorated Navy SEAL veteran with 5 deployments to combat zones who is an expert with firearms and firearm safety,"" the campaign statement said. ""Derrick was traveling with his family and this situation was purely accidental. He fully cooperated and apologized to TSA for adding to the stress of their job, thanked them for the work they do keeping us safe, and it has been fully adjudicated.""

TSA found 5,972 guns at checkpoints across the country last year. It hit a 20-year record as of the fall with three months left in the year, according to TSA.

Van Orden lost to Kind in 2020 and soon after launched his bid for the 2022 election. Kind announced he is not running in August, about three weeks before Van Orden was fined.

Democrats running for the seat are Eau Claire small business owner Rebecca Cooke, U.S. Navy veteran Brett Knudsen, La Crosse Ald. Mark Neumann, retired CIA officer Deb McGrath and state Sen. Brad Pfaff of Onalaska.

The winner of the Aug. 9 primary will face Van Orden in November.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/1-firefighter-killed-8-injured-fast-moving-new-york-city-blaze-rcna25787,"2 dead, including firefighter, after fast-moving New York City blaze","A firefighter and civilian were killed, and multiple others injured, in a fast-moving blaze that erupted at a Brooklyn home Sunday afternoon, officials said.

The firefighter was identified as Timothy Klein, 31, a six-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department, Mayor Eric Adams and acting Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said in a joint statement.

Klein was one of more than 100 firefighters who responded Sunday afternoon to the three-alarm fire in Brooklyn’s Canarsie neighborhood, NBC New York reported.

Eight other firefighters were injured in tackling the blaze, the FDNY said.

One civilian was also pronounced dead at the scene and another was treated for injuries but refused to be transported to a hospital, fire officials told NBC News Monday morning.

Klein and several other firefighters were inside when their supervisor ordered them out amid deteriorating conditions, the joint statement said.

Before Klein could escape, a ceiling collapsed, trapping and critically injuring him, the statement said. He was later removed by other firefighters and pronounced dead at a hospital, officials said.

Three other firefighters were also taken to hospitals with injuries, the statement said.

The conditions of the other injured firefighters weren’t immediately available. The cause of the fire remained unclear.

In the statement, officials noted that Klein delivered the eulogy for his fellow firefighter and friend, Steven Pollard, who died in 2019 responding to an accident on the Belt Parkway. Klein's father was also a firefighter.

“He bravely followed in their footsteps,” the statement said. “The hearts of the entire Department are with the Klein family and with the members of Engine Company 257 and Ladder Company 170.”",Q2

In so doing, the court held that the employee of a private business is not protected from termination under the U.S. and New Jersey constitutions when the employer is not a state actor. In an age in which many individuals believe they have the legal right to post on social media and that doing so is akin to speaking in the “town square,” the New Jersey court’s decision provides notable pushback on this view and follows the majority of courts that have addressed this issue.

In McVey v. Atlanticare Medical System, an employee prominently displayed her association as her company’s corporate director of customer service on her private Facebook account. During the height of the nationwide protests involving George Floyd’s murder, the employee posted on her Facebook account that she believed the phrase “Black Lives Matter” was racist, caused segregation, and that she “support[ed] all lives … as a nurse they all matter, and [she] d[id] not discriminate.” She also posted that she did not condone the rioting that had occurred following Floyd’s death.

McVey’s employer, a health care system, informed all employees, including the plaintiff, through its social media policy to be mindful of their social media posts because their social media activities had the potential to affect the employee’s job performance, the performance of others, the company’s brand and/or reputation, and the company’s business interests. The company also warned employees in its social media policy to be cautious about “topics that may be considered objectionable or inflammatory – such as politics and religion….” Upon learning of the employee’s Facebook post, the company informed the employee that it was conducting an investigation, and then terminated her employment very shortly thereafter.

The employee’s lawsuit against her employer was limited to one claim: that the termination of her employment violated a clear mandate of New Jersey public policy under the First Amendment and the New Jersey state constitution. In rejecting this position, the court held that a claim for wrongful termination of employment as against public policy cannot be based on constitutional free speech rights where the employer is a private business. Constitutional rights can be violated only if there is state action. The court also confirmed that the employer had the right to terminate its at-will employee, particularly given the identification on the employee’s Facebook account of her status as an employee of the company, and the potential risk her inflammatory post could harm the company’s business.

Because the employee’s lawsuit was limited to her claim that the company had violated her federal and state constitutional rights, the court’s decision did not address the other instances in which employees may still have legal protection for their social media posts, including under the National Labor Relations Act. There are also instances in which employees have the right to speak out on social media when they believe their employer is violating antidiscrimination laws, wage and hour laws, and the like. As such, employers should not construe the McVey case as a blanket endorsement of a private employer’s right to terminate employees for their social media posts in all instances. Each situation will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis depending upon the language in the post and any public policy considerations at issue.",Q2

Meet Pippin!

attachment-Pippin 3 loading...

This super chill amazingly sweet old boy is looking for a nice quiet home to spend his golden years! Pippin is a ten-year-old Corgi mix. At 26 pounds, he isn't too small or too big! He loves to run around outside in his yard and is very selective with his canine companions. He does have one dog friend here that he plays with. At the Sanctuary every dog gets yard time in the morning and everyone goes out in shifts. Pippen is very smart and waits for a yard to empty and then runs into it the minute his yard gate is opened instead of going back to his kennel! Most of the time staff lets him have his extra time because he is such a good dog! Pippen needs an adult household as he isn't comfortable with children. He would make a great companion dog to sit and watch tv with, take on walks through the neighborhood, and may even enjoy the occasional short ride to Starbucks for a Pup-o-chino! If you think Pippen sounds like the perfect chill pup for you, come meet him during the Sanctuary's visitation hours! You may just find your best friend!

Once home, remember the rule of three: three days to decompress, three weeks to get used to your routine and home, and three months to feel completely at home.

https://www.fitsnews.com/2022/06/14/the-alex-murdaugh-jail-house-calls-john-marvins-too-scared-to-do-anything-thats-teetering/,'John Marvin's Too Scared': Alex Murdaugh's Fist Days In Jail,"The family moved quickly to sell off assets before the receivership got appointed …

Two days after a judge first denied Alex Murdaugh bond last fall, the disgraced Hampton County attorney called his younger brother and son from Richland County Detention Center and warned them to move quickly.

“Hey, John,” Murdaugh said to John Marvin Murdaugh on Oct. 21, 2021. “In court the other day, they made a big deal about things … they’re going to be moving to try to prevent us from selling stuff. We need to get as much as we can completed … I don’t know if it’s going to be a day or a week or two weeks.”

Murdaugh told John Marvin and Buster to sell off his assets before Allendale attorney Mark Tinsley could get at them, according to one of the hundred or so recorded phone calls that Murdaugh’s “bulldog” attorneys had tried to prevent FITSNews and Murdaugh Murders Podcast from getting.

In February, FITSNews and Murdaugh Murders Podcast exclusively published the first round of calls, which directly contradicted several assertions being made publicly by Murdaugh’s attorneys Jim Griffin and state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, who promptly filed a complaint in federal court to block further release of the recordings.

FITSNews and the podcast led the fight to ensure these public documents were released.

The latest round of calls — which have since been requested by multiple media companies — were released last week after a federal judge denied Murdaugh’s request to stop the public from hearing them.

As FITSNews founding editor Will Folks predicted in March, the calls they tried to block have, in fact, turned out to be rather incriminating.

For instance, the family was clearly working to keep money away from Alex Murdaugh’s growing line of creditors. The money raised from the sale of Alex Murdaugh’s assets was being funneled to a debt allegedly owed to Palmetto State Bank by Alex and their father, Randolph Murdaugh III.

In paying off this unsecured line of credit, the family was — in essence — preserving their own wealth and keeping creditors away from their sizable trusts. Their sale of Alex’s assets to friends and family members also seems similarly designed to shuffle money from one column to another.

***

***

At the time of the Oct. 21, 2021, call, Tinsley — who represents the family of Mallory Beach in a 2019 wrongful death case in which both Murdaugh and his son Buster are co-defendants — was a day away from filing a motion to stop the Murdaugh family from liquidating Alex’s and Buster’s assets.

That motion — which the judge would rule in favor of at the beginning of November — also asked the court to place Alex’s finances under a receivership.

In his arguments on Oct. 29, 2021, Tinsley told the court that Alex Murdaugh is not your “average criminal” and that the receivership “is a process to protect everyone, including the people who may not even know their money is missing yet.”

Tinsley’s words would prove to be true.

Alex Murdaugh now faces 83 charges, most of them stemming from the alleged theft of $8.4 million from clients.

In October, however, much less was publicly known about his alleged crimes.

“They can’t serve you,” Murdaugh told Buster on Oct. 23, 2021. “I guess, they can serve you individually to keep you from doing anything as power of attorney. But that don’t keep John Marvin from selling this shit. You know? I mean, the shit that ain’t got titles especially.”

The Beach case had loomed large for Alex Murdaugh in the lead-up to the June 2021 murders of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul. For months, Alex had ignored a subpoena requesting detailed information about his finances.

As evidence emerged over the summer of 2021 that Alex Murdaugh was cashing out his assets, Tinsley and attorney Eric Bland — who represents the family of the Murdaugh family’s housekeeper, from whom Alex has admitted to stealing $4.3 million — accused Alex Murdaugh of attempting to bankrupt himself so there’d be nothing left for a growing list of Murdaugh’s victims.

Bland joined Tinsley in his call for an injunction and receivership.

‘It Ain’t Like We’re Squirreling It Away …’

During one of his first phone calls from jail, Alex told John Marvin to talk to Griffin about how much time they had.

“You might speak to Jim, if you get a chance,” Alex said, “just to find out what kind of timeframe he thinks before they get any kind of order preventing us from doing anything.”

In the meantime, John Marvin offered to purchase a dump truck and excavator from his brother.

“That’ll be the easiest way to do a sale,” John Marvin said about the plan, which would keep those assets in the family.

A call between Alex and Buster in November would demonstrate Alex’s feelings about keeping assets in the family. During that call, he told Buster that having John Marvin serve as “personal representative” to Maggie’s estate would be no different from Buster serving as the PR.

“They just seem to think that with everything going on and the scrutiny and everything, it’d be a better idea [for me] not to be [personal representative],” Buster told Alex.

“Who’s going to be it?” Alex asked.

“John,” Buster said.

“I mean, that’s basically the same thing, isn’t it?” Alex said.

“Basically,” Buster answered.

In the Oct. 21 call, Alex told John Marvin not to buy the machinery “just to help me.”

John Marvin — who owns a heavy equipment rental and sales center — indicated he wasn’t able to find buyers for either piece of equipment and thought he might as well buy them off his brother.

“Like I said, don’t do that,” Alex said. “I mean, if you want them, shit I’ll give them to you.”

“No, no. Nope. Not going to do that,” John Marvin said. “OK. I know what to do.”

“I’m serious. If you need them, John Marvin,” Alex said.

“Bo, I don’t need them.”

In dozens of calls during his stay at the jail, Alex Murdaugh would remind family members that not only were their calls being recorded, they were being monitored.

At points during the Oct. 21 call, both Alex and John Marvin were careful to signal that no shenanigans were afoot with this arrangement.

“I’m just doing everything by the book,” John Marvin told Alex in the call.

“It ain’t like we’re squirreling it away,” Alex said. “It’s going to pay bank stuff.”

“Well, it goes to the unsecured note,” John Marvin said, referencing a more than $600,000 Palmetto State Bank line of credit Alex took out with their father. “Everything else has something securing it, so it makes sense. Unsecured items would go to an unsecured note.”

John Marvin handed over the phone to Buster, and Alex updated him on the impending motion and referred to a “Mark,” which is believed to be Mark Ball, his former partner at Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth and Detrick, who — according to the calls — helped facilitate the sale of a boat for Alex.

“I just told John we need to, they’re going to move to try to stop us from selling stuff,” Alex said. “We need to get — if Mark and them are going to do that, they need to do it and we need to get that on that note ASAP, and get the boat money on that note ASAP. You know, I don’t know if this is going to be a day or a week or two weeks, but they’re going to move to stop us from selling assets.”

“That’s messed up,” Buster said.

“Well, that’s the civil side. That dude’s just trying to put on a show, grandstand and everything,” Alex said of Tinsley, whom he later calls “volatile” during a call with Buster in which they discuss the receivership hearing.

Palmetto State Bank

Since this phone call was made last fall, Palmetto State Bank has emerged as a problematic player in Alex Murdaugh’s alleged schemes.

One of the bank’s vice presidents, Chad Westendorf, served as a highly paid “personal representative” in the Gloria Satterfield settlement, which investigators believe helped Alex Murdaugh and Beaufort attorney Cory Fleming abscond with the money.

Former bank CEO Russell Laffitte is currently on house arrest for allegedly conspiring with Alex Murdaugh to steal from clients for years.

Under Laffitte’s leadership, the bank allowed Alex Murdaugh to take out millions of dollars in loans despite his apparent inability to keep a positive balance in his checking accounts. According to court filings, Alex routinely allowed his accounts to go into overdraft, sometimes to the tune of six figures, and was sporadic at best about paying back the money.

The bank appears to have consistently accommodated a customer who otherwise should have raised alerts in this highly regulated industry.

In August 2021, the bank approved another $750,000 loan to Alex.

Because of this and other banking irregularities, Tinsley and the receivers have questioned the legitimacy of Alex Murdaugh’s Palmetto State Bank loans.

On Monday, reporter Drew Tripp of ABC15 News reported that co-receivers John T. Lay and Peter McCoy have now asked a Colleton County Probate Court judge to invalidate the intermarriage sale of the Murdaughs’ Moselle property from Alex to Maggie for $5 .

Palmetto State Bank purportedly holds a $2 million mortgage on the property that Alex Murdaugh was able to secure despite not actually owning the property.

Just over a week after Alex’s phone call, Alex’s older brother Randy Murdaugh and former law partner Johnny Parker filed separate claims in court seeking repayment of hundreds of thousands from Alex. Immediately, Alex offered a confession of judgment in Randy’s case. The move was largely seen as another avenue for the Murdaughs to preserve their assets by shuffling them around and prioritizing the bank, as well as friends and family as creditors.

‘This Eric Bland Guy Seems Like A Real Charm’

In a call on Oct. 23, Buster expressed concern over the upcoming receivership hearing.

“I’m doing good,” he told his father. “Just, you know, the new developments with the motions and everything trying to get us to quit selling stuff. I don’t know really what that’s going to … what that has in store.”

“I told y’all this was coming,” Alex said. “I called John Marvin the other day to tell him he needed to do it as quickly as possible because they were going to be doing it any day.”

“This Eric Bland guy seems like a real charm,” Buster said.

“Well, this is his five minutes in the sun, you know?,” Alex said.

In the call, Alex told Buster that he isn’t sure there’s anything that can be done but that he asked John Marvin to get in touch with Ball to “get those funds and put it on that thing.”

“Well, it’s done now,” Buster said about the motion. “So no reason to fret about it.”

“No. He’s filed a motion. He doesn’t have an order yet.”

“No, no,” Buster said. “I understand that it’s not ruled upon.”

“I would think they got to serve me to do it,” Alex said.

“Well, they should have to serve one of us if they’re going to stop me from doing something,” Buster said.

“They can only serve you if you accept service,” Alex said.

The plan to sell off assets quickly appears to have involved Alex’s former law partner Mark Ball in some way — though, according to the calls, Ball had not been returning the family’s calls at the end of October.

“John Marvin is too scared to do anything that’s teetering,” Buster told Alex.

“Huh?”

“I said, John Marvin is too afraid to do anything that’s teetering, you know what I mean?”

FITSNews will continue to report on the Alex Murdaugh Jail House Calls through the week.

This month, our state and nation reeled from the tragic loss of life at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa. Like all Oklahomans, I was heartbroken to learn of this violent attack against an anchor of the community that serves our neighbors every day.

Unfortunately, the attack on caregivers in Tulsa is a repugnant escalation of national trends that have been worrying health care leaders since the beginning of the pandemic. Across the U.S., incidents of workplace violence against health care workers have been on the rise.

As a health system, our top priority is zero harm to patients and caregivers. If caregivers are worried about their own safety, it makes it hard to focus on patient safety.

We cannot ignore that health care settings are not alone in witnessing increased violence. Recently, our communities have seen increased rates of violent crime, child abuse, and self-harm. The largest act of violence in Oklahoma continues to be suicide.

While various forms of violence may not all look the same and are influenced by myriad root causes, they are all related to each other by mental anguish. Violence is a toxic cycle that can be both caused by and a contributor to mental anguish.

I want to note that research does not show a strong correlation between diagnosed mental health disorders and acts of mass violence. Instead, evidence demonstrates that early intervention and care for individuals in need can help prevent violence. To make change, we must work to create common parameters on several fronts – access to mental health care, increased screening for unaddressed mental health needs, measures to reduce gun violence without interfering with Second Amendment rights, and expanded comprehensive suicide reduction programs.

I am encouraged that a bipartisan group of U.S. senators has come to an agreement to increase funding for mental health care, telemedicine, and additional support services, along with other safety measures. This investment, accompanied by Oklahoma’s increased funding for mental health care, should make it easier for our communities to access the care they need while keeping our caregivers safe. As a state, we still have recovery work to do, but I am hopeful these and other measures will make it possible for caregivers to feel safe at work so they can stay focused on providing patients with safe, high-quality, affordable health care.

Less than two years after her appointment, Kimball Mizelle has upended the travel industry as airlines, buses, subways and rideshare companies scramble to change their rules. Here's what we know about the Lakeland-raised judge.

Florida Middle District Judge Kimball Mizelle was confirmed to the lifetime position of federal judge by the Republican-controlled Senate in the weeks after President Donald Trump lost his bid for reelection. She was named to the bar in 2012. At age 33, she was the youngest Trump-nominated federal judge.

Federal Court Judge and Lakeland native Kathryn Kimball Mizelle with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, for whom she clerked.

During the nomination process, the nonpartisan American Bar Association declared her to be not qualified, citing her lack of experience in court.

The Republican senators who voted for her pushed back against the assertion, lauding her work as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, as an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice and in the private sector at law firm Jones Day, which at the time was representing the Pennsylvania Republican Party against private lawsuits and a suit from the Democratic Party regarding voting rights. The law firm later represented Trump in a suit seeking to overturn election results.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted for Kimball Mizelle, while Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., did not vote as he was quarantining after a COVID-19 exposure.

Education

Kathryn Kimball Mizelle graduated at the top of her class in 2012 from the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Kimball Mizelle graduated from Lakeland Christian School in 2005 first in her class. In 2009, she attained her bachelor's from Covenant College, a private Christian liberal arts college on Lookout Mountain in Dade County, Ga. She then earned her law degree from the University of Florida Levin College of Law, graduating in 2012, again first in her class.

Kimball Mizelle went on to clerk for several judges, including Judge James S. Moody Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida — where she now serves as a judge herself in Tampa — and for Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Supreme Court from 2018 to 2019.

She also served as a prosecutor in the tax division of the Department of Justice, counsel to the Associate Attorney General and special assistant to the U.S. Attorney in Northern Virginia. Kimball Mizelle went on to practice private law at Jones Day in Washington, D.C., from 2019 until her appointment to the bench in 2020.

Her lifetime position of federal judge comes with a $223,400 salary.

Washington, D.C., attorney Kathryn Kimball Mizelle was nominated by President Donald Trump to become a U.S. district judge in the Middle District of Florida. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in late 2020. Mizelle is Trump's youngest nominee to the federal bench.

Kimball Mizelle has been a member of the conservative Federalist Society since 2012, the year she was admitted to the Florida Bar and is listed as a contributor on its website.

“I joined the Federalist Society upon graduation because I wanted to continue to have the opportunity to grow as a lawyer by being exposed to events where speakers would advocate for opposing views,” she said in a written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee during her confirmation hearings.

The Federalist Society was founded in 1982 as “a group of conservatives and libertarians"" dedicated to promoting “limited, constitutional government; and the rule of law in protecting individual freedom and traditional values.”

Kimball Mizelle is married to Chad Mizelle, another Florida native. Mizelle, who at the time of their marriage served as acting general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, joined law firm Jones Day's Government Regulation Practice department in January 2021. He is based in the D.C. and Miami offices.

Before she worked for DHS, Mizelle served as associate counsel to Trump from 2018 to 2019 and as counsel to the deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice from 2017 to 2018.

Appointment

Before her appointment to the bench, Kimball Mizelle had never tried a case in court as a lead attorney and had only eight years of experience as an attorney, which led the nonpartisan American Bar Association to declare her not qualified for the position.

The ABA wrote in a Sept. 8 letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that “a nominee to the federal bench ordinarily should have at least 12 years’ experience in the practice of law."" It added that Kimball Mizelle ""was admitted to practice law in Florida on September 27, 2012. This represents a rather marked departure from the 12-year minimum.”

The ABA did point out that of Kimball Mizelle’s four distinguished federal clerkships, one, a one-year clerkship, was in the trial court.

“That year, plus her 10 months at a reputable law firm and approximately three years in government practice translates into five years of experience in the trial courts. We have taken into account the nominee’s experience in federal grand jury proceedings, which are non-adversarial and do not take place before a judge. In each instance those proceedings resulted in the defendant’s agreement to a plea of guilty with no trial,” the letter read.

“A substantial majority of the Standing Committee has determined that Ms. Mizelle is ‘Not Qualified',"" the organization wrote.

In response to her questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., then-ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kimball Mizelle said she had tried only two cases to verdict, once serving as co-lead counsel in law school on a case as a “certified legal intern” at the State Attorney’s Office and as associate counsel to the lead counsel in the other.

She told Feinstein she had appeared in court approximately 40 times over the course of her career as an attorney, arguing on behalf of the Department of Justice.

However, she never served in civil or criminal court as lead or co-counsel.

According to Matthew Cimento, a spokesman for the ABA, which typically helps administrations vet candidates, it was rare during the Trump administration for the ABA to oppose a nominee. Just 10 of the 326 Trump nominees came back not qualified.

Kimball Mizelle told the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, that her work in the government and in private practice had provided her with sufficient experience.

""While at Jones Day, I have represented companies in both high stakes civil litigation as well as significant criminal defense cases, including the defense of two companies in a $3 billion healthcare fraud prosecution,"" she wrote in her response to the questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""These experiences, along with my service in the Associate Attorney General’s Office and as a law clerk at every level of the federal judiciary, have prepared me to be a fair and effective federal district court judge.”

In materials provided to the committee prior to her confirmation hearings, she declined to answer questions put forth on her opinions regarding the federal government's ability to regulate businesses in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

""As a judicial nominee, it would be improper for me to offer my personal view on any issue that is likely to come before a court, including the authority of the federal government to impose safety standards on businesses,"" she wrote.

President Donald Trump in September 2020 nominated Kathryn Kimball Mizelle to be a U.S. District judge in the Tampa-based Middle District of Florida. The Lakeland native was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

Mask ruling

Kimball Mizelle on Monday declared the Biden Administration's mask mandate for airline and other public transit travelers an overreach by the Centers for Disease Control.

The mask mandate passed by the Biden Administration in January 2021 required people to wear masks in airports and on certain modes of public transportation, including many trains, airplanes and intercity buses, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The mandate was based on a 1944 Public Health Services Act that declared the director of the CDC could issue regulations ""as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases.""

The disease caused by the coronavirus mainly travels through microscopic droplets and particles exhaled by infected persons, according to the CDC; wearing a mask traps those droplets and reduces risk of infection in others.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the White House stood in opposition to the ruling. ""This is obviously a disappointing decision,"" she said. ""The CDC continues recommending wearing a mask in public transit.""

The mask mandate had been set to expire Monday but the CDC announced last week that it would keep it in place until May 3. The delay would allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus that is responsible for the majority of cases in the country.

It was the mask mandate's fifth extension despite repeated requests from airlines and other travel industry officials to ease restrictions.

Basing her ruling on the definition of cleaning, Kimball Mizelle concluded that the CDC could require or order cleanings, fumigations or more, but not preventative sanitary measures.

""Wearing a mask cleans nothing,"" Kimball Mizelle wrote in her ruling. As such, she concluded, ""the Mask Mandate falls outside of"" federal regulations.

Every major U.S. airline has now made face masks optional for passengers and employees. That includes Delta, United, American and Southwest as well as Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant, and newer airlines like Breeze and Avelo.

A man has been given the death penalty for killing his own daughter after subjecting her to 22 hours of sexual torture.

Joshua Burgess, 35, strangled 15-year-old Zaria Burgess and cut her throat in August 2019 at his home in Monroe, North Carolina.

Investigators say Burgess strangled his daughter before slitting her throat, although authorities have not yet listed a motive for the killing.

A sheriff statement reported by Channel 9 said: “The defendant in this case, Joshua Burgess, is the essence of evil and stole Zaria from her friends, family, and local community.

“While we know Zaria is forever gone to us, we hope that today's verdict helps to bring some closure to Zaria’s family and friends and we will continue to keep them in our prayers each days.”

Zaria was found dead at her dad's home in August 2019 but, according to the Union County District Attorney’s Office, Burgess slit his daughter's throat after ""psychologically and sexually torturing her for 22 hours at his home.

""This was truly an especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel killing of an innocent child.

""This case was emotionally taxing for everyone involved. We continue to grieve with and pray for Zaria’s mother.""

Burgess was convicted of first-degree murder and one count of statutory rape, three counts of statutory sex offence, and one count of first-degree sexual exploitation of a minor.

""He received an additional minimum of nearly 76 years in prison for those offences,"" the DA's office stated.

https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/may/31/biden-honors-nations-fallen-talks-on-guns/,"Biden honors nation’s fallen, talks on guns","WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden said Monday that the ""Second Amendment was never absolute"" and that after the Texas elementary school shooting, there may be some bipartisan support to tighten restrictions on the kind of high-powered weapons used by the gunman.

""I think things have gotten so bad that everybody's getting more rational, at least that's my hope,"" Biden told reporters before honoring the nation's fallen in Memorial Day remarks at Arlington National Cemetery.

His comments came a day after he traveled to the shattered Texas community of Uvalde, mourning privately for three-plus hours with anguished families grieving for the 19 children and two teachers who died in the shooting. Faced with chants of ""Do something"" as he departed a church service, Biden pledged: ""We will.""

After the Uvalde trip, Biden spent Sunday night at his home in Delaware. As he arrived at the White House for Memorial Day events, he was asked if he's now more motivated to see new federal limits imposed on firearms.

""I've been pretty motivated all along,"" he said. ""I'm going to continue to push and we'll see how this goes.""

In Congress, a bipartisan group of senators talked over the weekend to see if they could reach even a modest compromise on gun legislation after a decade of mostly failed efforts. That included encouraging state ""red flag"" laws to keep guns away from those with mental health problems.

""The Second Amendment was never absolute,"" Biden said. ""You couldn't buy a cannon when the Second Amendment was passed. You couldn't go out and buy a lot of weapons.""

Later, the president and first lady Jill Biden were joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at Arlington for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Standing at attention under a cloudless sky in the late-May heat, Biden saluted as taps played, after laying a wreath of multicolored flowers wrapped in red, white and blue ribbon in front of the tomb.

Delivering remarks honoring fallen service members, he said, ""Memorial Day is always a day where pain and pride are mixed together.""

""Today we are free because they were brave,"" the president said.

But Biden said the nation's experiment in democracy remains under threat, both abroad, in the form of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and in division at home. He called upholding democracy ""the mission of our time.""

""Our memorial to them must not be just a day when we pause and pray,"" Biden said. ""It must be a daily commitment to act, to come together, to be worthy of the price that was paid.""

In his earlier statements to reporters on guns, Biden said he'd not spoken to Republicans on the issue, ""but my guess is ... they're going to have to take a hard look.""

There is nowhere near enough support from congressional Republicans for broader gun measures popular with the public -- such as a new ban on assault-type weapons or universal background checks on gun purchases. Still, Democratic advocates hope meaningful measures could still pass.

Biden said he had taken some executive actions on guns. ""but I can't outlaw a weapon"" and can't ""change the background checks.""

He said he didn't know where congressional negotiations stand, but ""there's realization on the part of rational Republicans"" that ""we can't keep repeating ourselves.""

Before returning to Washington, the president and first lady, whose veteran son Beau died of cancer caused by a brain tumor in 2015, attended church Monday morning and laid flowers at their son's grave.

""Today's the day our son died,"" Biden said at Arlington, telling families that he knows remembrances like Monday's can ""reopen that black hole"" of pain.

But he said because of their commitment to the ideals of America, ""A part of them is still with us no matter how long ago we lost them.""

The Bidens also hosted a breakfast in the White House's East Room with about 130 members of veterans organizations, military family groups and senior Defense Department and other administration officials.

The president, the first lady and representatives of five Gold Star families who lost relatives in combat also planted a Southern magnolia tree on the White House South Lawn. The tree came from a sapling of a nearby magnolia planted by President Andrew Jackson in 1835.

As the group used shovels to toss dirt on the newly planted tree, Biden grinned and said ""shovel brigade."" He and the first lady later held hands with those gathered in a circle around the tree and prayed silently.

GROUND ZERO CEREMONY

Twenty years after a ringing fire bell and a solemn ceremony marked the end of the hellish cleanup effort at Ground Zero, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday that a hole remains in New York's heart despite the grand redevelopment of the area where the twin towers once rose.

""We will never forget this. Never, ever,"" Hochul said of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack. ""For many, the devastation, the loss occurred on that day: 9/11. But there's so many who know the bigger story. For 260 days, people showed up here exposed to toxins and contaminants.""

The cleanup was more than the removal of nearly 2 million tons of rubble left by the monstrous attack. Thousands of body parts were picked up in the eight-month project, and some led to the identification of victims.

On May 30, 2002, workers hung up their hardhats and put away the black buckets that had been used in the cleanup. The city held a 20-minute, word-free ceremony at 10:29 a.m., the exact time the north tower collapsed 261 days earlier.

Every year since, Hochul noted, the death toll from the terrorist attack has grown as people have succumbed to health complications stemming from exposure to toxic dust at Ground Zero. On 9/11 alone, 2,763 people died at the World Trade Center.

""That is what we don't forget,"" Hochul said. ""The brave people. The sanitation workers who showed up and had to endure the unthinkable -- what they saw.""

""The private contractors,"" she continued. ""The city agencies. Everybody who showed up and made sure everything that was drawn from this site was honored and placed in a hallowed ground.""

Celebrating the ""strength and resiliency"" that New Yorkers displayed after terrorists plowed two planes into the twin towers, Hochul said their response gave her confidence that the state would rise after the pandemic.

""At one time, this was a gaping hole,"" Hochul said in remarks by the leafy park at the 9/11 Memorial, in the shadow of the gleaming One World Trade Center.

""That hole is healed with this beautiful shrine -- this place of solemnity,"" Hochul said. ""But that doesn't mean the hole in our heart has healed.""

https://www.wtxl.com/news/florida-news/pressure-mounts-for-further-abortion-restrictions-during-floridas-special-session,Pressure mounts for further abortion restrictions during Florida's special session,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — With Roe v. Wade's end looking imminent, more of Florida's pro-life advocates are urging that the Legislature further restrict abortion in the upcoming special session on property insurance.

Some even prayed for it outside the statehouse Thursday morning as Florida observed the National Day of Prayer.

If Roe v. Wade is reversed, states get autonomy over abortion rights. That means Florida's new 15-week abortion ban is set to take effect in July. Some, however, want more.

Those we spoke with at Thursday's prayer rally in Tallahassee supported a fetal heartbeat bill, halting abortions at about six weeks.

E.W. Scripps State Rep. Anthony Sabatini speaks about his support for the passage of the heartbeat bill in Florida.

""Once a heart starts beating, and a mother sees that sonogram — or anyone sees it — that is a living soul,"" said Martha Hoover, an attendee of rally.

Advocates hope the Legislature may have softened after declining to take up a heartbeat bill earlier in the year.

It was carried by state Rep. Webster Barnaby, R-Orange City, and modeled after a policy enacted by the Texas Legislature.

One of the supporters, state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, R-Clermont, was eager to try again.

The far-right Republican has denounced GOP leadership for not making the policy a priority and is now calling on the governor to push for it.

""Everything that gets done comes from the governor's office,"" Sabatini said. ""The governor basically tells the legislative leadership what he wants and they do it because they fear him because he's a very popular and great leader. If the governor gets behind it, they will do it.""

E.W. Scripps Rep. Anna Eskamani makes a plea for voters to take action if abortion rights continue to be in danger in Florida.



So far, Gov. Ron DeSantis hasn't really weighed in on further restrictions. When asked for his opinion this week, he has touted the 15-week ban and said it's on firm legal ground.

""It's wrong to read the federal Constitution to completely prohibit any pro-life protections,"" DeSantis said Tuesday. ""We'll see what the federal U.S. Supreme Court does, and then, obviously, we're going to see some litigation on the state level with the protections that we've done.""

Opponents are planning challenges under the state's broad privacy laws. Democrats, meanwhile, are pressing voters to act if judges don't, saying women's health care is at risk.

""At the end of the day, we have to look beyond that,"" said Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, during a recent news conference. ""We have to look at elections. We have to look at talking about this at the doors and making this an issue that voters are plugged into.""

Requests for comment from both Senate and House leadership weren't immediately returned. For now, the scope of May 23's special session remains property insurance.",Q2
https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2022/05/17/abc-swoons-over-bidens-buffalo-speech-trying-heala-very-broken,ABC Swoons Over Biden’s Buffalo Speech Trying to ‘Heal...a Very Broken Country’,"All three broadcast networks aired special reports Tuesday afternoon on President Biden’s visit to Buffalo, New York following Saturday’s racist act of terror and, in the case of ABC, senior White House correspondent Mary Bruce was enthralled and almost emotional in vocalizing support for Biden’s broad strokes about white supremacy. In Bruce’s words, Biden was saddled with “a really impossible task...to heal what is still very clear a very broken country.”

Ah, nothing like a good side of America-bashing too in the same vein as CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King hours earlier.

ABC’s World News Tonight anchor David Muir teed Bruce up, boasting of Biden’s “strong words” about how many in “the media and politics” are peddling white supremacy “for power, political gain, and for profit.” From there, Bruce boasted that there was “no question that this is the strongest condemnation yet from Joe Biden since he took office, against the hate, the racist hate that is ripping this country apart.”

She continued by touting how “really remarkable” it was for Biden to attack “members of the media and those in the political sphere.” Note how Bruce accepted Biden’s premise as fact:

And what is really remarkable here is that President Biden directly called out the members of the media and those in the political sphere that are allowing this hate to fester. The President calling out those who are allowing this kind of hate to radicalize individuals through the internet into believing this kind of fringe, racist replacement theory that was espoused by the alleged shooter in Buffalo. And the President saying that those who spread lies for power, political gain, and profit, must be called out[.]

Bruce added that America’s “strong” thanks to “the diversity of this country” and such opposition to diversity at Charlottesville in 2017 was what led Biden to run for president.

The ABC partisan made it seem as though Biden “critics” were only the left, noting they’ve wanted him to do more and wield “his bully pulpit, his microphone, the power of the presidency and his political weight.”

On Tuesday, Bruce argued that he fulfilled that “to begin a really impossible task of, as a President, directing and trying to respond to hate and to heal what is still very clear a very broken country.”

Muir concurred, warning that he’ll be “holding accountable those in the media, those in the politics who are using this, ‘for power, political gain, and for profit.’”

Over on CBS, correspondent Ed O’Keefe identified those who wanted Biden to do more were Democrats and demand he “cite people who work at Fox News” and “Republican leadership, especially in the House.”

O’Keefe also touched on a proposal from House Democrats to expand resources to investigate domestic terrorism, but has been stalled due to Democratic infighting about how it could backfire in the future even though they’d use it to “target [Republican] groups, perhaps closer to the white supremacy thought that the President is calling out.”

And on NBC, far-left Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson argued that white supremacy was not only “part of the history of this country,” but “a growing part of the present.” In other words, look for white supremacy around every corner!

https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/jacob-klein-accused-stalking-elana-radin-murdering-philip-rabadi,"Jacob Klein Accused Of Stalking Elana Radin, Murdering Philip Rabadi","Neighbors' doorbell cameras allegedly captured Jacob Klein confronting Philip Rabadi at the victim's home before Rabadi was discovered bound, stabbed, and mutilated on the garage floor.

Man Accused Of Driving From Virginia To New York To Stalk Ex Before Murdering Her New Husband

A man is accused of traveling across several states to stalk his ex before murdering her new husband.

Jacob L. Klein, 40, was arrested on Friday evening in Franklin County, Virginia, after authorities say he killed Philip Rabadi, 35, at the victim’s New Scotland, New York, residence, according to NBC affiliate WSLS-TV 10. Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said authorities found Rabadi on his garage floor on Wednesday morning after his spouse called authorities to perform a welfare check.

Rabadi and his wife, Elana Radin, worked together as physician assistants at St. Peter’s Hospital, Apple said at Saturday’s news conference. Radin grew concerned when Rabadi did not show up at the hospital for his shift.

According to the Times-Union, the couple only married in September.

Apple said deputies arrived at the Miller Rd. residence around the same time as Radin and the victim’s father. Rabadi had been “bound” and sustained “multiple stab wounds and mutilation to his body,” according to Apple.

Within hours, authorities identified Klein – who had ties in the Albany area – as a suspect in the investigation, according to a press release from the Albany County Sheriff’s Office.

“Investigators were able to backtrack all of Klein’s movements while he was in the Albany area with the assistance from the FBI and the Albany Crime Analysis Center,” authorities said. “The crime scene was processed for evidence by the New York State Police Forensic Identification Unit, and local bodies of water near the scene were checked for additional evidence by the New York State Police Dive Team.”

Apple said Klein was also a physician’s assistant, though it was unclear in which state he was licensed to practice, if any. According to the press release, Klein currently lives in Virginia.

“Jacob did travel to this area from Virginia in his vehicle and began stalking the victim three days prior to the murder,” said Apple, who declined to go into further detail.

It was not believed that Klein personally knew the victim. Sheriff Apple also said that Radin was unaware that Klein had been stalking her.

Authorities believe Klein drove from Virginia to New York before renting a car from an Enterprise in Albany, according to the Times-Union. Klein used the rental car to survey the couple’s residence and their place of work.

Law enforcement sources told the Times-Union that phone data helped track Klein’s movements, which indicated he’d previously visited the victim’s residence. They said that Klein had taken an Uber in Albany at some point in time, and authorities have since seized that video from the ride.

Apple said residents the victim's street were instrumental in helping authorities paint a picture of the morning’s events, thanks to footage captured on Ring and Nest doorbell cameras.

Radin reportedly left work at around 6:00 a.m., according to the Albany outlet. Officials said they believe Klein waited for her to go to work before the suspect confronted Rabadi at his front door at around 7:30 a.m. Sources said it appeared Rabadi answered the door before reacting as though the suspect drew a weapon on him before following the victim into his home.

A handgun was recovered from Klein’s vehicle shortly after Friday’s arrest, authorities said.

Deputies quickly enlisted the help of the FBI-Albany Division and other law enforcement agencies. They tracked Klein’s movements after the murder and located him in Tennessee, calling on the Tennessee Highway Patrol for their assistance.

Virginia State Police and Tennessee Highway Patrol arrested Klein shortly after he crossed the state border into Virginia, according to the sheriff’s release. Following the issuance of an arrest warrant from New York, he was arrested for second-degree murder.

Additional charges will follow upon his extradition, which is expected to take place this week, Apple stated.

Klein is a military veteran with no criminal history, according to the Times-Union. He has previously worked as a physician’s assistant in California and upstate New York, having once worked at Columbia Memorial Hospital in Hudson. Klein spent much of his childhood in Cobleskill, New York, less than 50 miles west of the state capital.

He is expected to be arraigned in federal court on Monday before extradition back to Albany.",Q2
https://apnews.com/29577039a544284f39a9f9a388c2ca4d,Kavanaugh incident could lead to more security for judges,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A man armed with a machete once broke into Stephen Breyer’s vacation home in the Caribbean and took $1,000. Ruth Bader Ginsburg had her purse snatched on a Washington street. David Souter was assaulted by several men while he was jogging.

Supreme Court justices have not been immune to violent crime. But this past week’s late-night incident at Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s suburban Washington home, where authorities said a man armed with a gun and knife threatened to kill the justice, reflects a heightened level of potential danger not just for members of the nation’s highest court, but all judges.

One proposal pending in Congress would provide additional security measures for the justices, and another would offer more privacy and protection for all federal judges.

Round-the-clock security given to the justices after the leak of the draft opinion in a major abortion case may well have averted a tragedy.

But the situation had much in common with other recent incidents that ended with the shooting death of a former judge in Wisconsin last week and the killing in 2020 of the son of a federal judge at their home in New Jersey. Troubled men, harboring a warped desire for vengeance and equipped with guns, turned their threats into action.

“We’re seeing these threats increase in number and intensity. That’s a sign. That’s a signal,” said U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, whose son was killed nearly two years ago in the attack that also wounded her husband.

Kavanaugh’s would-be attacker is Nicholas John Roske, 26, of Simi Valley, California, authorities said in charging him with the attempted murder of a justice. Clad in black, he arrived by taxi outside Kavanaugh’s Maryland home around 1 a.m. Wednesday.

He spotted two U.S. Marshals who were guarding the house and walked in the other direction, calling 911 to say he was having suicidal thoughts and also planned to kill Kavanaugh, according to court documents. Roske said he found the justice’s address on the internet.

When police searched a backpack and suitcase he was carrying, they said they found a Glock 17 pistol, ammunition, a knife, zip ties, duct tape and other items Roske said he was going to use to break into the house. He said he bought the gun to kill Kavanaugh.

Roske told police he was upset by the leaked draft opinion in the abortion case and by the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and believed Kavanaugh would vote to loosen gun control laws, according to documents filed in federal court in Maryland.

Last week, Wisconsin authorities said Douglas Uhde, 56, shot John Roemer, a former county judge, in a targeted attack against a judge who had once sentenced him to prison. Roemer was found zip-tied to a chair. Uhde had shot himself and later died.

In July 2020, lawyer Roy Den Hollander showed up at Judge Salas’ home posing as a FedEx delivery person. Den Hollander fatally shot Salas’ 20-year-old son, Daniel Anderl, and wounded her husband, Mark Anderl. The judge was in another part of the home at the time and was not injured.

Den Hollander, 72, was a men’s rights lawyer with a history of anti-feminist writings. He was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound the day after the ambush, when police said they found a document with information about a dozen female judges from across the country, half of whom are Latina, including Salas.

Authorities believe Den Hollander also was tracking Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Salas said in a televised interview last year, because they found a manila folder with information about Sotomayor when they searched a locker belonging to Den Hollander.

Over the years, Supreme Court justices have called on Congress to provide more money for their security. But at the same time, the justices often shrugged off protection when it was offered. When Justice Antonin Scalia died on a hunting trip in Texas in 2016, for example, he did not have a security detail with him.

In recent years, the court has stepped up security for the justices. The court routinely refuses to discuss protection for the nine justices, but Justice Amy Coney Barrett said earlier this year that she was not prepared for how much more extensive security is now than when she worked for Scalia in the late 1990s.

Sotomayor likes to walk among guests at her public appearances, often joking about the armed officers who are there to protect her. “The guys up here. The big guys with stuff around their waist and things. They’re here to protect you from me,” she said to laughter at an event this year. “They get nervous if you get up unexpectedly. ... Please don’t make them nervous.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that the House would take up a bill with bipartisan support that already has passed the Senate that would expand protection to the members of the justices’ immediate families.

Gabe Roth of the court reform group Fix the Court said in his view the justices “need Secret Service-level protection, which has only become more obvious this week. I’ve said it for years.”

A separate bill, named in memory of Salas’ son, would provide more privacy and protections for all federal judges, including scrubbing personal information from the internet, to deal with mounting cyberthreats. The U.S. Marshals Service, which protects about 2,700 federal judges and thousands more prosecutors and court officials, said there were 4,511 threats and inappropriate communications in 2021, compared with 926 such incidents in 2015.

The legislation, also widely supported by lawmakers in both parties, has been blocked by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who wants it to apply to members of Congress as well.

Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the bill’s author, said the Kavanaugh incident and Roemer’s death in Wisconsin make plain the need for the legislation. “Our bill is the only existing proposal to protect the personal information of judges and their families,” Menendez said in an email.

A similar bill in the House has not even gotten a hearing.

“We talk a lot about what can be done. How about we stop arming the public with information they are using to kill us? How about we do that?” Salas said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press.

The internet has made it much easier to find personal information pertaining to judges, and everyone else.

But even before the digital age, judges were sometimes the targets of people who harbored grudges about their treatment in the criminal justice system. In a book, retired Texas Judge Susan P. Baker details 42 judges, including three at the federal level, who were murdered or otherwise met suspicious ends in the 20th century.

In the past 17 years, three close relatives of federal judges have been killed in attacks at the judges’ homes, including Salas’ son. In 2005, U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow returned from work to find her husband and mother shot dead in the basement of her Chicago home. The killer was a homeless electrician who had lost a medical malpractice suit in her courtroom.

U.S. District Judge Roslynn R. Mauskopf, who heads the office responsible for federal courts administration, said the incident at Kavanaugh’s house is just the most recent reminder that “threats against judges are real and they can have and have had dire consequences.”",Q2

As lawmakers were unable to enter due to police, the no-confidence motion against Speaker Elahi was scuttled on technical grounds as no member of the PML-N could present it against him.

As soon as the session started, under the panel of chairs in the absence of any lawmaker, it was adjourned to June 6.

Afterwards, Khalil Tahir Sindhu of the PML-N said that the session was adjourned on ""unlawful grounds"" and that they would move against the speaker again today. ""Nowhere in the law is it said that once a motion is rejected, it cannot be re-introduced.""

Earlier, MPAs from the PML-N-led coalition alleged that some PTI and PML-Q lawmakers were allowed inside, and held Elahi responsible for it, while the speaker blamed the ""father-son duo"" of PM Shehbaz Sharif and CM Hamza Shehbaz.

The session was scheduled to begin at 12:30pm. Elahi had summoned lawmakers to arrive at the assembly half an hour before.

Security was beefed up outside the assembly, DawnNewsTV reported, and television footage showed a contingent of police equipped with riot control gear outside the gates.

PML-N's Ataullah Tarar told reporters that the gates have been closed on the orders of Parvez Elahi. ""Elahi did all this using his men. No media or MPAs are allowed to enter. This is not district council Gujrat, this is the centre of 120 million people.""

Addressing Elahi, Tarar said he has ""made it a habit"" to violate the sanctity of the house. ""A no-confidence motion was moved against you and under the Constitution, it is obligatory to hold the session within seven days."" He also said PML-N lawmakers would be protesting outside the gates until they were allowed in.

Separately, PPP Parliamentary Leader Syed Hassan Murtaza told reporters, said that only PTI lawmakers were being allowed to enter the assembly. He alleged that such methods were being used to ensure that a ""mishap"" could occur so that there would be grounds to disqualify lawmakers.

On the other hand, Elahi in a conversation with reporters, said the ""father-son"" duo of Shehbaz and Hamza Shehbaz had shut the gates when asked who was responsible for the obstacles.

He said that it was now evident to the media that they (the government) ""have made a police gate"". ""The truth is they have seen that they don't have the numbers. We have more people. Their lotas (turncoats) have been de-seated ... There is no one that can stop legislation.""

He also warned that those police officials who obstruct proceedings were risking Article 6 — treason — cases.

Earlier in the day, Elahi spoke of the enhanced security presence, and said: ""Let's see who prevents the elected members from entering the assembly.

""We will fight against government fascism. No one can stop elected representatives from entering the assembly.""

Former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema also took to Twitter and requested the ""heads of the law enforcement agencies and constitutional institutions"" to take notice of the situation in Punjab.

""How long can the province of 120 million be bullied by this father-son [duo] and police,"" he said, adding that the public should not be forced to take to the streets to ""free the province"".

Assembly official reportedly arrested

Ahead of the session, the day was not short on drama, as an assembly official was taken into police custody, according to a spokesperson for the Punjab Assembly.

The spokesperson confirmed reports of the arrest of Parliamentary Affairs Director General Rai Mumtaz. In a statement, the spokesperson claimed that police officials entered Mumtaz's home after scaling the walls.

He alleged that police officials also conducted a raid at the home of Punjab Assembly Secretary Muhammad Khan Bhatti and Secretary Coordination Inayatullah Lak, but were unable to arrest the two.

Speaker Elahi condemned the police action and claimed that it was being carried out on the orders of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. He also termed the government's actions ""fascist"".

""After violating the sanctity of the House, the government is making use of new tactics,"" he said, adding that the action against officials of the Punjab Assembly was proof that the government was ""panicking"".

""The unconstitutional and fake government is taking steps against the Constitution and law,"" he stated, adding that the ""true face"" of the Sharifs had been unmasked before the people.

Later in the day, it emerged that a case had been registered against the three Punjab Assembly officials at the Shahdara police station on the complaint of MPA Ashraf Rasool.

The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered under Sections 452 (trespassing), 506-B (punishment for criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Rasool alleged that five men came to his home at 10am on May 21. When he went outside, he discovered three of the armed men were the assembly officials, adding that all five of the suspects forcibly entered his residence.

""Muhammad Khan Bhatti, Inayatullah and Rai Mumtaz pointed their pistols at me,"" he said, adding that the Punjab Assembly secretary asked to leave him alone. The MPA quoted the secretary as saying that he would kill the lawmaker if he did not stop ""opposing him"".

""He also asked the other four men to threaten me with dire consequences,"" he said, adding that this was an attempt to deter him from fulfilling his parliamentary duty.

The complainant alleged that as the Punjab Assembly secretary, Bhatti had favoured people from his hometown of Mandi Bahauddin when making appointments. The lawmaker said that he had taken up the issue in the Punjab Assembly.

Separately, in a statement, Bhatti said that the provincial assembly was a democratic institution and its officers were attacked in the ""dark of the night"".

He claimed that during the raid at his residence, officials made away with jewellery, a mobile phone, a laptop and an LCD TV. He alleged that the family of the coordination secretary was also harassed, in addition to items being stolen.

Bhatti said that the arrest of a senior bureaucrat like Rai Mumtaz had made a mockery of the law. He also said that he would register a case against the police officials for stealing items from their homes.

Session called ahead of schedule

On Saturday, Elahi had rescheduled the assembly session from May 30 to May 22 (today), after 25 dissident PTI MPAs who had voted for Hamza Shehbaz for CM office against their party direction were de-seated.

Though no formal agenda was issued till Saturday evening, the swift action by Speaker Elahi shows the numbers game now suits him for his run-off election as chief minister.

The assembly’s current strength has reduced to 346 members after the de-seating of the 25 MPAs. The PML-N has 165 MPAs of whom five Sharaqpuri group members recently withdrew their support. Besides the backing of its 160 MPAs, the PML-N has seven PPP MPAs, four independents and one Rah-i-Haq Party MPA on its side. This shows PML-N has 172 votes.

On the other hand, Elahi’s PML-Q and his ally PTI have a total strength of 168, but the PTI-PML-Q alliance believes they will get all the five women and minority seats whereas the PML-N claims two reserved seats will come to it.",Q2

The victim, the department said, is the suspect’s sister.

The suspect, said the authorities, fled the scene after torching the house — an act that led fire crews to search for him inside. That search concluded when the authorities discovered the suspect was alive and well “away from the scene.”

The authorities have not released the names of either the suspect or the victim.

The fire broke out around 4:57 a.m. on Easter Sunday in the 4400 block of Beaver Road SW, the police department and the fire department both said.

“Once fire crews were able to successfully control the fire, a 10-year-old female victim was found deceased, inside the burned home,” said a police department press release. “Gwinnett Fire Department Arson Investigators determined the fire was set intentionally.”

Gwinnett County Fire and Emergency Services crews said separately that a 911 caller who reported the incident “advised there was a fire in front of the house, and she was trying to get the kids.”

“Additional information advised two kids were outside with the caller and two kids were still inside the house,” the fire department said. “Due to the information provided, additional units were requested and started towards the scene.”

Their description of the incident continued:

On arrival, firefighters found a single-story residence on a slab with heavy fire involvement throughout the front of the structure. A walk-around of the structure was completed while hose lines were deployed through the tree line to the front of the home. While crews worked to get a knockdown, multiple crews arriving on scene began performing Vent-Enter-Search (VES) which focuses searches on tenable locations for victims primarily utilizing exterior window access. Multiple aggressive search attempts were executed to locate the missing children. After the fire was brought under control, a 10-year-old female victim was located deceased in room used as a bedroom without window access. Efforts continued for the next couple hours to sift through debris to locate the 15-year-old male that was believed to be inside. Around 9 a.m., the 15-year-old was located away from the scene and appeared to be okay. The home sustained extensive fire damage throughout the front half of the structure including the attic. Two cats were also found deceased inside the home.

Fire officials said seven people — two adults and five children — lived at the home.

“One adult and four children were at home when the fire broke out,” the fire department continued. “According to a family member, smoke alarms are installed in the home, but they did not activate.’

Police chaplains and the American Red Cross were both assisting the survivors, the fire department added. Two adults, four children, and two dogs needed shelter.

A full cause-and-origin investigation remains ongoing, the fire department said.

Six engines, one ladder truck, and a bevy of other fire apparatuses were used to knock down the inferno.

A neighbor told Atlanta NBC affiliate WXIA that he had only spoken to the occupants of the destroyed home twice over a 25-year period. The neighbor, Mike Kilgore, said he believed the children were homeschooled.

“How can one kid take another kid’s life, especially when it’s your own brother or sister?” Kilgore said of the allegations.

Gwinnett County Police Department Investigator Christian D’Allaird told the TV station that the incident was isolated and that there was no threat to the public at large.

All of the kids killed in the mass shooting in Texas Tuesday were in the same fourth grade classroom when teenage gunman Salvador Ramos shot them dead with an AR-15 he legally bought on his 18th birthday.

At least 19 students and two teachers were killed in the massacre, which saw 18-year-old Salvador Ramos storm the at Robb Elementary in Uvalde - roughly 80 miles west of San Antonio - just after 11:30 am.

Each of the victims - all aged under 11 - were killed inside a single classroom, the Texas Department of Public Safety revealed Wednesday, as authorities continue to assess the situation and identify all the victims.

Ramos - who just days before the attack bought two AR-style rifles and paraded them on social media - indiscriminately rained bullets on the room, before being fatally shot himself by police.

Cops are still gauging the extent of the disaster - the deadliest shooting at a US elementary school since the 2012 Sandy Hook killing - as new victim names continue to emerge.

Of the 19 kids slain, so far, 17 have been named.

Included among the dead was an eight-year-old boy whose grieving grandfather lamented was the sweetest little boy that I've ever known' and a 10-year-old girl who was killed as she tried to phone 911 while sitting next to her best friend, who ended up covered in her blood.

Another victim was confirmed by state Gov. Greg Abbot to be the daughter of a local sheriff.

Ramos also reportedly shot his grandmother, believed to be in her 60s, before embarking on the killing spree. The pair reportedly had been arguing about the teen's failure to graduate from nearby Uvalde High School.

The woman - who served as Ramos' guardian - is now in a local hospital fighting for her life.

The teenager has been described as a self-harming loner who was bullied because of his clothes, but who managed to save nearly $5,000 to buy two AR-15 guns and three hundred rounds of ammunition after turning 18 last week.

It has since been revealed that the shooter was known to police because of his violent arguments with his drug-addicted mother.

In addition to those confirmed killed as a result of Ramos' killing spree, more than a dozen kids were reportedly injured in the attack, including a ten-year-old girl taken to hospital in the nearby city of San Antonio in critical condition.

A 66-year-old woman - believed to be Ramos's grandmother who he shot at the start of his killing spree - was in the same hospital, also in critical condition.

A second hospital within Uvalde said a further 13 children had been brought in Tuesday, without saying what condition they are in. Police warned late Tuesday that the death toll is expected to rise.

Below are the confirm victims:

Amerie Jo Garza, 10

Amerie Jo Garza, a fourth grader at Robb Elementary, was one of 19 students confirmed to be killed Tuesday morning by Ramos, who cops say was carrying a handgun and an AR-15 during the attack that also killed two teachers in the classroom.

Her grandmother, Berlinda Irene Arreola, said the 10-year-od was killed as she tried to phone 911 while sitting next to her best friend, who ended up 'covered in her blood.'

Arreola said Ramos told the students and staffers inside the room, 'You're going to die,' before opening fire - shooting her granddaughter dead as she tried to phone for help.

'So the gunman went in and he told the children, 'You're going to die,' Berlinda told The Daily Beast.

'And [Amerie] had her phone and she called 911. And instead of grabbing it and breaking it or taking it from her, he shot her. She was sitting right next to her best friend. Her best friend was covered in her blood.'

Uziyah Garcia, the youngest victim to be identified so far at age 8, was also killed in the attack

Uziyah Garcia, 8

Uziyah Garcia, the youngest victim to be identified so far at age 8, was also killed in the attack.

The boy's grandfather, Manny Renfro, broke the news early Wednesday after being notified by authorities.

'[He was] the sweetest little boy that I've ever known,' Renfro said. 'I'm not just saying that because he was my grandkid.'

Renfro recalled how Uziyah last visited him in San Angelo over spring break.

'We started throwing the football together and I was teaching him pass patterns.

'Such a fast little boy and he could catch a ball so good,' the grieving grandad said.

'There were certain plays that I would call that he would remember and he would do it exactly like we practiced.'

The child's mother, Felicha Martinez, told the Washington Post Tuesday that just hours before the massacre, the mom had been at the school to see her son participate an honor roll ceremony.

She took a picture showing her son showing off his certificate.

In the last exchange she had with the child, the mom heartbreakingly told the boy that she was proud of him and that she loved him, giving him a hug goodbye - not knowing it would be the last time she would see him alive.

'He was funny, never serious and his smile… that smile I will never forget,' she recalled after learning of his death from police. 'It would always cheer anyone up.'

The boy's cousin, Lisa Garza, 54, of Arlington, said Xavier enjoyed swimming and had been looking forward to the summer.

'He was just a loving 10-year-old little boy, just enjoying life, not knowing that this tragedy was going to happen today,' she said.

'He was very bubbly, loved to dance with his brothers, his mom. This has just taken a toll on all of us.'

Amelia Sandoval, Lopez's grandmother, said: 'It's just so hard... you send your kids to school thinking they are going to make it back home but they're not.'

Portrait of a killer: Call of Duty-loving shooter, 18, was bullied at school for being poor, creeped out his Wendy's female co-workers, and lived with his grandmother who he shot at START of rampage after row over not graduating

In yet another tragic mass shooting, Salvador Ramos, 18, slaughtered 19 innocent children and two much-loved teachers at Robb Elementary school, in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday before being killed in a shoot out with a Border Patrol officer and local law enforcement.

It is the second deadliest shooting in US history after the infamous Sandy Hook massacre in 2012 - which saw 26 people killed - and has once again left people asking how someone could commit such a heinous crime.

As the country tries to make sense of the tragedy, stories about Ramos are beginning to emerge from those who knew him best, painting the picture of loner with a propensity for self-harm and violence, who was from an unstable home, including an alleged drug-using mother.

Texas State Senator Roland Gutierrez said in a local television interview that the school shooter was born in North Dakota, but attended high school in Uvalde.

Neighbors and classmates say his behavior spiraled into the bizarre and macabre as he entered his later teenage years, with one friend telling Good Morning America: 'He had scars on his face and someone asked him, 'Are you ok?' and he just said with a smile 'I did it myself, I liked how it looked.'

He began dressing in dark clothes and military boots and used his BB gun to target random people, one local claimed.

There are around 15,000 residents in Uvalde which sits roughly 80 miles west of San Antonio, around an hour's drive from the US-Mexico border.

The would-be mass murderer lived with his grandmother on Hood Street, less than three miles from the Robb Elementary school.

More than one-third of residents in the city live at or barely above the federal poverty line.

According to Ramos' neighbor Ruben Flores, 41, the shooter and his mother would often have screaming matches, with police being called to the home on multiple occasions.

Four days before the shooting, Ramos reportedly sent his friend pictures of his guns and ammunition. When asked why he had it, Ramos allegedly replied: 'Don't worry about it'

His social media was filled with new rifles, which he purchased on his 18th birthday

Ramos' last known address, his grandmother's residence, is seen taped off by police as they carry out searches

He had recently gotten a job at the local Wendy's (pictured), where co-workers say he sent inappropriate text messages to his female colleagues

In since deleted Instagram videos, Ramos had allegedly filmed his mother interacting with police.

Classmate Nadia Reyes claimed: 'He'd call his mom a b***h and say she wanted to kick him out... He'd be screaming and talking to his mom really aggressively.'

Flores, meanwhile, told the Washington Post how he had tried to be a father figure to Ramos but that the situation at home only worsened as he got older.

Jeremiah Munoz, an alumnus from the local high school who used to play Xbox games with Ramos, also told the New York Times he would often hear him arguing with his mother through the microphone - and his mother would scream back at him, telling him he needed to go to school and he was doing nothing with his life.

Munoz said Ramos would often leave his mother's house and stay with his grandmother for several days after a big fight - and over the past year he has been spending more and more time with his grandmother.

Ramos' grandmother, who owned the house on Hood Street, was reportedly in the process of evicting the mother over her drug use in the days before Tuesday's killing spree. Flores said Ramos had moved into his grandmother's home across town some months earlier.

There, his grandfather, Ronaldo Reyes, 72, said he lived in a front room and slept on a mattress on the floor. Reyes told ABC News he had no idea his grandson purchased two AR-15s nor that he kept them in the house.

As a convicted felon, Reyes is not allowed to have guns inside his home, he said, and if he knew Ramos was keeping weapons there he said he would have turned in his grandson.

But, Reyes said, he did not think his grandson was dangerous, noting that he had tried to encourage his grandson to attend school, but he would just shrug in response.

'These kids these days think they know everything,' he said.

Now, Reyes said he is shocked and does not understand how his grandson could have committed such a heinous crime - saying he did not know how to drive and did not have a drivers' license.

He also wondered how his grandson would have purchased the weapons, or if he was trained on how to use them.

By all accounts, Ramos (pictured) had been a relatively normal child until the eighth grade, with his 'best friend' from that period, Stephen Garcia, branding him the 'nicest' and 'shyest kid' who 'just needed to break out of his shell.'

On the morning of the shooting, Reyes said, the suspect and his grandmother got into a 'minor argument' about a cellphone bill, but it was nothing significant.

Still, she would be Ramos' first victim on Tuesday, after Reyes shot her in the forehead.

The 66-year-old - who has not yet been publicly named - is now undergoing surgery, and Reyes said he believes she will survive.

By all accounts, Ramos had been a relatively normal child until the eighth grade, with his 'best friend' from that period, Stephen Garcia, branding him the 'nicest' and 'shyest kid' who 'just needed to break out of his shell.'

Reportedly Ramos was bullied for a stutter and lisp. Classmates also allegedly called him with gay slurs. At one point, he uploaded a picture of himself wearing eyeliner.

'He would get bullied hard, like bullied by a lot of people,' Garcia told the Post, 'Over social media, over gaming, over everything.'

When Garcia had to move away, Ramos began to change, dressing in all black and donning large military boots.

In his early childhood, friends claim, he had been nicknamed 'pelon', meaning bald in Spanish, for his incredibly short hair. But in an apparent bid to leave those days behind, he began to grow it long.

He was then branded an 'emo' or 'alternative' at school, where he got into multiple fist fights before increasingly playing truant.

During the last few months of his life, Ramos was working at a Wendy's and was hardly in attendance at school. He was not set to graduate this year, a fact he seemed to despise.

One neighbor told local news channel Newsy that he witnessed Ramos arguing with his grandmother on Tuesday, claiming he was 'angry that he did not graduate'.

He said the grandmother then screamed: 'He shot me, he shot me', before Ramos 'zoomed down the street' and crashed his pick-up truck before embarking on his killing spree - which happened to take place just one day after his colleagues had graduated.

As he morphed into a 'different person' into his later teen years, one local claimed he would ride around at night with a friend firing a BB gun at random passersby. He is also said to have egged people's cars.

He is said to have found it hard to hold onto friendships, often 'taking things too far' with 'weird' comments.

He killed 19 kids and two adults at an elementary Robb Elementary School on Tuesday

One friend, who wanted to join the Marines, said he cut off Ramos after the killer told him he only wanted to join the force 'so he could kill people.'

A former classmate, who asked not to be identified, also told CNN he and Ramos were somewhat 'close' and used to play Xbox together. The killer was a fan of the shooting and combat game Call of Duty.

On his since removed Instagram account, Ramos is believed to have shared a photo of two AR15-style rifles just three days before the massacre, while the bio on his TikTok page chillingly read: 'Kids be scared irl' (in real life).

Meanwhile, his Wendy's co-workers told the Daily Beast that he had an 'aggressive streak' and would send inappropriate messages to female employees. They also branded him 'quiet' and 'anti-social'.

One said: 'He would be very rude towards the girls sometimes, and one of the cooks, threatening them by asking, 'Do you know who I am?'

'And he would also send inappropriate texts to the ladies.'

The same source claimed there were multiple videos of Ramos fighting people with boxing gloves at a local park.

'He'd take them around with him,' they claimed.

In the hours leading up to the killings, the shooter reportedly showed off his guns to an LA-based woman via his Instagram page, taunting that he was 'about to do' something.

When the woman asked what, he said: 'I'll tell you before 11.' He began shooting at noon.

'As soon as he made entry into the school he started shooting children, teachers, whoever was in his way, he was shooting everybody,' Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez said.

'This is just evil', an Uvalde resident told the New York Times, 'I'm afraid I'm going to know a lot of these kids that were killed.'

Another local, Adolfo Hernandez, told the same paper that his nephew had been in a classroom near where the shooting took place.

'He actually witnessed his little friend get shot in the face,' Hernandez said. The friend, he said, 'got shot in the nose and he just went down, and my nephew was devastated.'

Speaking anonymously, one classmate said Ramos had begun showing up to class less and less as other kids bullied him over his clothes and his family's financial situation.

'He would, like, not go to school...and he just, like, slowly dropped out. He barely came to school,' the friend said.

After the North Dakota native graduated from high school, the friend said they became even more distant from each other, but would occasionally message each other on Xbox.

'He would message me here and there,' he said.

Four days prior to Tuesday's shooting, Ramos reportedly sent his friend a picture of the AR and a backpack full of 5.56 rounds.

'[He had] probably like seven [magazines],' he said. 'I was like: 'Bro, why do you have this?' and he was like: 'Don't worry about it.''

Under a new Texas law passed in September, those aged 18-21 could buy guns if they had a protective order, because they were at risk of family violence, stalking, prostitution or sex trafficking.

The law also removed the requirement for a permit for a handgun. Rifles were already permitted in Texas without licenses.

In the days leading up to the massacre, Ramos told his friend that he 'looked very different now.'

'You wouldn't recognize me,' he messaged less than a week ago.

Ramos's social media was full of photos of his new guns, which he bought on his 18th birthday, state senator Roland Gutierrez said.

Ramos also messaged a Los Angeles-based woman on May 12 on Instagram, tagging her in a photo of the guns.

'You gonna repost my gun pics,' @sal8dor_ direct messaged her.

'What your guns gotta do with me,' [sic] she replied on Friday.

'Just wanted to tag you,' he said back.

Then at 5:43am on Tuesday, @salv8dor_ messaged her and said: 'I'm about to'.

The girl asked 'about to what' to which he answered: 'I'll tell you before 11.'

He said he would text her in an hour and urged her to respond.

'I got a lil secret I wanna tell u,' he messaged with a smiley face emoji covering its mouth.

'Be grateful I tagged you,' he wrote.

She replied: 'No it's just scary,' adding: 'I barely know you and you tag me in a picture with some guns?'

His last message at 9:16am on Tuesday was 'Ima air out'.

The shooting started around 11:32am. The woman reacted with horror when she learnt what he had done.

'He's a stranger I know nothing about him he decided to tag me in his gun post,' she wrote.

'I'm so sorry for the victims and their families I really don't know what to say.'

She then added: 'The only reason I responded to him was because I was afraid of him I wish I stayed awake to at least try to convince him to not commit his crime. I didn't know.'

When an Instagram user asked if she was his girlfriend, she replied: 'I don't know him and I don't even live in Texas.'

He largely dropped out, and took the job at Wendy's nearby, where co-workers remember him as quiet.

Adrian Mendes, evening manager at the Wendy's, said Ramos 'kept to himself mostly.'

'He felt like the quiet type, the one who doesn't say much. He didn't really socialize with the other employees,' Mendes told CNN.

'He just worked, got paid, and came in to get his check.'

Mendes said that he did not know Ramos well - he was already employed when Ramos began in February - and didn't see him most of the time because they were on different shifts.

Ramos worked from 11am to 4pm or 5pm, five days a week for about a year, according to the New York Times. He then quit about one month ago.

Ramos was shot and killed by law enforcement at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, after he had murdered 21 people.

Texas elementary school massacre is just the latest in long line of bloody school shootings over the last 10 years

SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, DECEMBER 2012: 27 DEAD, 2 INJURED

Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 elementary school students at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the largest school shooting in the US

In December 2012, the deadliest school shooting in America took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Lanza arrived to the school with three guns - a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle, and two pistols after killing his mother, Nancy - with whom, he reportedly only communicated via email.

When he arrived to the school around 9.30am, the doors were locked as part of a new safety feature the school had recently rolled out. He allegedly 'shot the entrance into the building,' according to CNN.

The school psychologist and vice principal went to investigate after hearing 'popping' noises and the psychologist was shot by Lanza.

The elementary school was placed in lockdown and students were ushered into restrooms and closets to hide.

Lanza moved toward kindergarten and first-grade classrooms first. In one of the classrooms, he shot all 14 kindergarteners and six first-graders.

By the time law enforcement arrived to the scene, 20 students and six staff members were killed.

Little angels and stuffed animals lined the dirt in honor of the elementary schoolchildren who died in the shooting

As law enforcement approached the 20-year-old, he shot himself.

Although his motive is unknown, Lanza's old writings were discovered years later and shed light into the young man's mind. He had written to a fellow gamer that he had a 'scorn for humanity' and had been 'desperate to feel anything positive for someone for my entire life.'

A child advocate's for the state of Connecticut also said Lanza had severe mental health problems and suffered from anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder and was on the autism spectrum. He was also preoccupied with violence, according to CBS News.

With ease of access to his mother's weapons and being home-schooled, the advocate said it was 'proved a recipe for mass murder.'

MARYSVILLE PILCHUCK HIGH SCHOOL, OCTOBER 2014: 4 DEAD, 1 INJURED

Jaylen Fryberg, 17, killed his four 'ride or die' friends at lunch in October 2014 and said he 'needed to do this'

Marysville student Jaylen Fryberg, 17, gathered his friends around a table in the Washington state's school cafeteria and shot each of them in the head one-by-one to take them to 'the other side,' in October 2014. He shot them with a 'blank stare' and shot them 'left to right.'

Fryberg had sent a photo of the handgun to a friend just moments before he would open fire, killing four. He told the person he texted to call him before he did 'the thing.'

After shooting the four students as others watched on, he shot himself as a teacher ran toward him, the Washington Post reported.

The teen had methodically planned the massacre, even leaving a note for his parents with his funeral arrangements and what to do with his assets, if he had any.

He had texted his father: 'Read the paper on my bed. Dad, I love you.'

Students hug and cry after the shooting that took the lives of four and injured one

Inside the note, he told his parents he wanted to be 'fully dressed in Camo in my casket' and all his 'trust money or whatever goes to my brother.'

Fryberg also apologized to his friends' parents, but said he needed 'ride or dies with me on the other side.'

'I LOVE YOU FAMILY! I really do! More then anything,' he wrote. 'I needed to do this tho[ugh]…I wasn't happy. And I need my crew with me too. I'm sorry. I love you.'

UMPQUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE, OCTOBER 2015: 9 DEAD, 9 INJURIED

Student Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, killed himself after the shooting

Student Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, opened fire in Snyder Hall at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, in October 2015 around 10.45am.

He killed eight students and one teacher before police arrived. Authorities and Mercer engaged in a brief shootout, before Mercer turned the gun on himself and took his own life.

More weapons were found in his apartment, which he shared with his mother, and he had handed a student a USB drive with his manifesto on it.

'It's pretty well laid out that he was a dejected failure,' Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said at the time. 'The only thing that I can conclude from it is he was mentally and emotionally ill.'

His manifesto detailed a life of a lonely virgin, who self-described himself as the 'most hated person in the world' and said he hated black men, whom he said only cared about their 'penises.'

Mercer also reportedly said he was constantly 'under siege' by 'morons and idiots,' the Oregonian reported.

Mercer wrote: 'What was it that was supposed to happen, what great event was it that was supposed to make me realize how much there was going for me?

'But for people like me there is another world, a darker world that welcomes us. For people like us this all that's left. My success in Hell is assured.'

Police arrived on campus in bulletproof vests and rifles after Mercer killed eight students and one teacher

Hundreds gathered for a vigil for victims of a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College

The young man also reportedly said he was 'denied' everything he deserved and likened himself the Columbine High School, Virginia Tech, and Sandy Hook shooters.

'Though we may have been born bad. Society left us no recourse, no way to be good,' he reportedly wrote.

'I have been forced to align myself with demonic forces. What was once an involuntary relationship has now become an alignment, a service. I now serve the demonic Heirarchy(sic). When I die will become one of them. A demon. And I will return to kill again and again.'

NORTH PARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, APRIL 2017: 2 DEAD, 1 INJURED

Cedric Anderson, 53, shot and killed his wife at North Park Elementary, killing one student and injuring one other

Cedric Anderson, 53, entered the San Bernardino, California, school around 10.30am in April 2017, where his wife Karen Elaine Smith, also 53, worked as a special-education teacher.

He told administrators he was there to see his wife and walked into her classroom, which was positioned near the office.

He fired six shots from a Magnum revolver when he entered the classroom, killing his wife and an eight-year-old student and injuring another child. He reloaded the revolver and shot himself.

Although the motive is unknown, many suspected his wife - who had recently divorced him - was being abused, according to the San Bernardino Sun.

Since the shooting, her classroom IB, no longer exists. The classroom walls have been knocked down and it is now an open space for students to work on projects.

The school remodeled its building and outfitted every classroom with tempered glass windows, installed steel doors with locks on the inside, and a door that leads to the outside, which is mandated by law.

Although his motive is unknown, many suspect he abused his wife and that's what led to their divorce

AZTEC HIGH SCHOOL, DECEMBER 2017: 2 DEAD, 0 INJURED

William Atchison, 21, shot and killed two students at Aztec High School

Former student William Atchison, 21, disguised himself as student and hide in a bathroom with a Glock on the second floor of the New Mexico school, according to Fox News.

The custodian reported ran down the hallways screaming about an active shooter and telling teachers to go into 'lockdown.'

He killed a male student who walked into the bathroom before killing a girl in the hallway and then turned the gun on himself.

The shooter had left a manifesto on a USB drive that was found on his body, where he had allegedly wrote: 'Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks. I just want out...'

Atchison had been on the FBI's radar since 2016 after he allegedly asked in a forum: 'Where to find cheap assault rifles for a mass shooting?'

He told investigators he just liked to troll online forums and authorities found that he was not in possession of any weapons at the time after interviewing him at his parent's house.

MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS - PARKLAND, FEBRUARY 2018: 17 DEAD, 17 INJURIED

Nikolas Cruz, then 19, shot and killed 14 students and three staff members in February 2018. He pleaded guilty and now faces the death penalty

The now-third biggest school shooting in US history happened in February 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine's Day.

Nikolas Cruz, then 19, shot and killed 14 students and three staff members and injured an additional 17.

The shooter, who was adopted, shot students with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle. He began shooting students outside of the school before working his way inside, according to NBC News.

After the shooting, he slipped past authorities by hiding among the crowd running out of the school.

For years, Cruz was a subject of police attention as his parents had called 911 several times on him for being out of control and had been tripped off to the FBI about concerning behavior, NPR reported.

Starting when Cruz was 10 years old, his mother reported seeing violent behavior and had called the police after he and his other adopted brother Zach had gotten into a fight. She also reported Cruz had pushed her up against a wall after taking an X-Box game away and he had used a BB gun to shoot a chicken.

Students were ushered out of the building with their hands on each other's backs after the Valentine's day shooting

Hundreds of memorial items were gathered around the school sign after the shooting, which killed 17 and injured 17 others. It is the second largest school shooting in the US

After his mother died, he went to live with a family friend and had reportedly gotten in a fight with their son.

He told police: 'The thing is, I lost my mother a couple days ago. So like, I'm dealing with a bunch of things right now. I kind of got mad. And I started punching walls and stuff and a kid came at me and threw me on the ground. And he kicked me out of the house.'

The family claimed he put a gun to their son's head and had done it to his adoptive mother as well before.

Cruz (pictured in 2022) was adopted and showed signs of violent behavior the age of 10

Cruz had also been expelled from two school, was self-harming and had reportedly been diagnosed with depression, NPR reported.

He pleaded guilty in October 2021 and now faces the death penalty.

SANTA FE HIGH SCHOOL, MAY 2018: 10 DIED, 12 INJURED

Dimitrios Pagourtzis, then 17, shot up Santa Fe High School and now awaits trial and faces up to 40 years in prison

Dimitrios Pagourtzis, then 17, killed 10 and injured 12 others at Santa Fe High School in Texas in May 2018.

A student said Pagourtzis hid a shotgun and a handgun under his trench coat before opening fire in a first-period art class.

The then-student told police he did not kill anyone he liked because he wanted them to be able to tell the story, AP reported.

Authorities say Pagourtzis planned the killings, carried out with weapons owned by his father. Though Pagourtzis allegedly wrote about his intention to carry out the attack, authorities have not indicated a motive for the violence.

Although the motive is unknown, a student's mother said her daughter had rejected Pagourtzis romantically and her daughter, Shana Fisher, had made clear that she was not interested in him.

'He continued to get more aggressive,' the mother told AP. 'She finally stood up to him and embarrassed him.'

The incident took place one week before the shooting and it is unclear if that drove Pagourtzis to kill.

Police also said they found multiple IEDs, pressure cookers, Molotov cocktails, pipe bombs, propane tanks, and other homemade explosives near the school and parking lot after the shooting.

He had engaged in a 25-minute shootout with police before surrendering after being injured.

Pagourtzis is currently awaiting trial. He faces 40 years in prison.

Police gather outside the high school, where 10 died and 12 were injured

SAUGUS HIGH SCHOOL, NOVEMBER 2018: 2 DEAD, 3 INJURED

Nathaniel Berhow, 16, attempted suicide after the shooting and later died in the hospital

Nathaniel Berhow, 16, killed two students and injured two others at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, in November 2018.

Authorities said the attack was planned, but the victims were chosen at random.

'It was a planned attack; it was deliberate. He knew how many rounds he had, for example,' Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said at the time, according to NBC Los Angeles.

Berhow was dropped off at the school by his mother and was standing in the quad alongside other students. Authorities said he was standing away from students and was still before moving toward the center of the quad, where he dropped his backpack and began firing at students.

He shot five people in 16 seconds, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Berhow also shot himself in an attempted suicide and was taken to the hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries.

The motive for the attack is still unknown.

OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL, NOVEMBER 2021: 4 DIED, 7 INJURED

Ethan Crumbley, 15, faces life in prison and is scheduled to go to trial in September

The most recent well-known school shooter is 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, who opened fire at Oxford High School in Michigan after a guidance counseling meeting with his parents at the school.

Four students were killed and seven more people were injured in the shooting.

Crumbley had a meeting with school administrators, and his mother was contacted via voicemail by the school about her son's inappropriate ammunition-related internet search.

According to the prosecutor, the mother and father also failed to ask Ethan if he had his gun with him, or where his gun was, and did not inspect his backpack.

Instead, the teen returned to class and the shooting occurred later.

His parents were also arrested after a large-scale manhunt. James and Jennifer were captured in the basement of a building in Detroit, less than half a mile from the Canadian border.

All the Crumbleys are being held at the Oakland County Jail. His parents are currently facing trial for four counts of manslaughter and have requested their trial be moved out of Oakland County.

Ethan is awaiting trial, which is schedule for September, and he faces life in prison.

Fire investigators said a Dallas apartment fire that sent one person to the hospital and others scrambling likely started in a second-floor kitchen early Saturday morning.

When firefighters arrived at the scene just after 4 a.m., they saw flames and smoke coming from the roof of the two-story building in the 12000 block of Audelia Road.

Everyone was able to make it out, but one person was taken to the hospital after being exposed to smoke.

There was a 2-alarm response by fire crews, and about 50 firefighters were called to put out the flames.

At least 20 people were displaced by the fire, which damaged 10 apartments.

It’s believed the fire started in the kitchen of a second-floor apartment, but the exact cause is still being investigated.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10731813/Bay-Area-health-systems-face-nurses-strikes-week.html,Bay Area health systems face nurses strikes,"Nurses and health care workers at two Bay Area health systems are striking this week amid complaints of staffing shortages, low pay and unsafe conditions.

Employees at Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in California will walk out at 7am on Monday.

Union bosses said the hospitals were 'still not listening' to employees, and they were left with little choice after more than three months of negotiations.

More than 8,000 employees at Sutter Health went on strike for eight hours on Monday, amid a growing movement among staff after two brutal years of Covid.

The strikes come after a survey revealed half of U.S. nurses are now facing more violence at work now than a year ago, with chronic understaffing and Covid misunderstandings the primary drivers of the uptick.

More than 8,000 nurses walked out of 15 hospitals run by Sutter Health yesterday, amid demands for more staff and better pay. Pictured above are some of the protesters

Pictured here are nurses who walked out of one of Sutter Health's hospitals yesterday. The hospital has said they cannot return for five days, as extra staff have been brought in

More than 5,000 nurses at two hospitals in Palo Alto run by Stanford Health Care are also preparing to walk out of wards. They are calling for better pay and staffing levels

The Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achievement (CRONA) called the strike at the Stanford hospital and Lucile Packard, in Palo Alto — just outside of San Francisco —, after nine in ten of its members voted for the action.

The union — representing 5,000 nurses — was negotiating for more than 13 weeks over improving nurses pay, and a health and wellness offer and to tackle chronic staffing shortages.

HALF of nurses in the US say they have experienced a spike in workplace violence Half of nurses in the U.S. are now battling against violence on wards, one of the largest nursing unions in the country said today. In its bi-annual survey, National Nurses United found more than 48 per cent of nurses said they were facing a small or significant spike in violence at work. This was more than double the 21 per cent that said there were more assaults in their hospitals in March last year. Cases included patients spitting on nurses after being told they had tested positive for COVID-19, and scratching, hitting or even threatening healthcare workers with firearms. Hospitals have been facing surging rates of patients attacking staff in recent months, fueled by Covid misinformation and staffing shortages. Unions are calling for stronger protections for healthcare staff, warning the surge of attacks is leaving many 'distracted' and unable to do their jobs. Advertisement

Up to 40,000 nursing jobs are already vacant in California, estimates suggest, equivalent to one in ten positions.

Charon Brown, a nurse in the hospital's heart unit and CRONA member, said striking was a 'last resort' but that Stanford was 'refusing to take our wellbeing seriously'.

'Nurses are exhausted and we're burning out,' she said.

'We need contracts that give us time to rest and recover, mental health support, and wages and benefits that take care of us and our families.'

Stanford Health Care has told striking nurses that they will not receive pay for missed shifts.

Those who remain on picket lines at the start of May will also lose their health benefits.

But CRONA bosses have slammed this as 'cruel' and 'immoral', with president Colleen Borges saying: 'Health benefits should not be used against workers, especially against the very healthcare professionals who have made Stanford a world-class health system.'

Stanford says its hospitals will remain open throughout the strike, and that it has employed replacement nurses to ensure patient care is 'uninterrupted'.

Last year it was ranked as the fourth best hospital system in California, and the 12th best across the country.

The one-day strike by nurses at 15 Sutter Health hospitals was called by the California Nurses Association after talks over staffing shortages and health and safety provisions ended in deadlock.

The health system has now told nurses not to return until next Monday, because it has brought in travelling nurses to cover the shifts.

Hospitals involved in the strikes were in cities including San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Santa Cruz and Vallejo.

Yvette Neil, a nurse at Sutter for 18 years and union steward, told Lake County News: 'We're striking for patients' safety. Sutter is short staffing the nurses.'

She also warned that many nurses were exhausted from working 12-hour shifts at the hospital, and that morale on the wards was low.

Sutter Health also faced a strike in 2011

The U.S. is facing a growing nursing crisis amid mounting staffing shortages across its hospital and rising levels of violence faced by workers.

A national survey conducted by National Nurses United found 48 percent of nurses are facing more violence at work this year than they had previously.

More than seven in ten nurses added that their job was slightly or much worse than before the Covid pandemic, while 80 percent said it was more stressful.",Q2

DENVER — A Denver jury that will decide the fate of a man accused of killing his wife in 2015 heard testimony Thursday from a woman who had an affair with him just days before the death.

That woman told Stacy Feldman about the affair just hours before she died – details that are laid out in court documents but that the jury is expected to hear more about on Friday.

Stacy Feldman’s death on March 1, 2015, was originally classified as “undetermined” – but an outside expert brought in by Denver police and prosecutors concluded she’d been strangled or suffocated, and her husband was arrested in 2018 and charged with her murder.

Robert W. Feldman faces a single count of first-degree murder after deliberation. He told authorities he found his wife unresponsive in the bathtub.

In testimony late Thursday afternoon, Susan McBride told the jury that she’d met Feldman on a dating app and that he’d told her he was separated from his wife – which was not true.

McBride read a series of messages back and forth between her and Bob Feldman.

“Guess who. Just a little leg to tease you. LOL,” she messaged him at one point, including a photo of fuzzy slippers and her ankle.

After replying with information about his work, Feldman wrote, “So are those legs? Can I see more.”

McBride said she responded, “just how risqué do you think I am? I need to meet you first, toes would be a good next step”

Feldman replied, “I agree, we should meet, when can I see your toes?”

McBride testified that she and Feldman, who at one point used the name Mike Reed and at another said he was Robert Wolfe, eventually met for coffee

“It was just a very easy, friendly conversation,” McBride testified. “There was no lull in the conversation that I can recall. After I left there, I remember thinking, this is a nice guy.”

At one point, after she failed to find anything online under the names he had used, she tried to break off the relationship, she testified. Feldman convinced her to give him another chance after he said he’d been the victim of a stalker once and again convinced her he was separated from his wife.

A few days later, after dinner and a long discussion, they had sex, she testified.

Then, after Feldman broke plans to get together again, she began doing online searches and discovered Stacy Feldman’s name on the website for an elementary school.

At that point, Judge Edward Bronfin recessed the trial.

McBride is expected to be back on the stand Friday morning.

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2022/05/16/667835.htm,Louisiana Court Tosses COVID-Related Charges Against Pastor,"The Louisiana Supreme Court threw out charges Friday against a pastor who flouted restrictions on gatherings early in the coronavirus pandemic, ruling 5-2 that the governor’s executive orders violated freedom of religion.

“This is a tremendous win for religious civil liberties and it has vindicated us in our … battle with the governor trying to close the churches down,” said the Rev. Tony Spell, who drew national attention when his congregation continued to meet in the spring of 2020, while much of the nation was in lockdown.

Gov. John Bel Edwards disagrees with but accepts the ruling, said spokesman Richard Carbo. “Each and every action Gov. Edwards took throughout the COVID pandemic was done with the goal of protecting the public’s health and saving lives,” Carbo said in a text message.

The Supreme Court majority found that numerous secular exemptions showed that religious groups weren’t getting adequate consideration in mid- March 2020, when Edwards first limited gatherings to fewer than 50 people and, about a week later, tightened the limit to 10.

Churches around the country challenged state limits. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in November 2020 for churches in New York, reversing the trend of votes before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

In February 2021, the nation’s highest court ruled that California could not bar indoor services but could cap attendance at 25% of a church’s capacity.

The record in Spell’s case doesn’t include any proof that “gatherings in secular venues like office buildings and airports created less risk of virus transmission than such interactions at gatherings in a church building,” Louisiana Supreme Court Justice William J. Crain wrote.

He cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that “strict scrutiny” of First Amendment rights was needed in the case against California because the governor’s order contained “myriad exceptions and accommodations for comparable activities.”

There was too little evidence about anything in Spell’s case to make a decision, Chief Justice John L. Weimer wrote in his dissent. For instance, he wrote, there was no evidence either way about whether any churches’ religious worship or practices were adversely affected when they held services outdoors or online.

Nor, he wrote, was there any evidence about the capacity of Spell’s church or those businesses exempt from the orders, and the activities held in either.

“Arguments that secular activities were treated more favorably was just that _ arguments void of any factual support,” he wrote.

State Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican who often clashes with the Democratic governor, had filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Spell’s behalf.

“Once again, this Governor’s overreach has been defeated in court,” Landry wrote in a news release. “While it is unfortunate that it took almost two years, I am appreciative that John Bel’s unconstitutional actions have been halted by the court.”

Carbo said Edwards never closed houses of worship because he recognized their importance during the pandemic. “The Governor worked closely with faith leaders throughout the pandemic, and all were encouraged to hold services as safely as possible to protect their congregations,” he wrote.

Spell also sued Louisiana in federal court, asking for damage payments. A district judge twice ruled against him. The U.S. Supreme Court turned down his case, listing it on Dec. 6, 2021, among nearly 200 which it would not hear.

Jaishankar on Tuesday spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and discussed the latest developments in Ukraine.

India condemned the killing of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Monday, calling for an independent U.N. inquiry.

The United States announced Tuesday it will send $100 million in additional anti-armor weapons to Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said French President Emmanuel Macron has agreed to provide technical and expert support for an investigation into crimes committed by Russian troops in Bucha and elsewhere.

Mr. Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the atrocities committed by Russian troops are no different from terrorists like the Islamic State extremists as he demanded immediate action to bring the Kremlin’s forces to justice for “war crimes”.

The conflict began escalating on February 21, 2022, after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and deployed troops in a peacekeeping role.

U.S. slaps sanctions on Putin’s daughters, indicts oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev

The White House has announced sanctions on two daughters of Vladimir Putin over Moscow’s war on Ukraine, saying family members were known to hide the Russian president’s wealth.

It also declared “full blocking” sanctions on Russia’s largest public and private financial institutions, Sberbank and Alfa Bank, and said all new US investment in Russia was now prohibited.

The United States has also announced that it has indicted Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions violations. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Russian billionaire had been previously identified as a source of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and as providing support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine. “After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,” Mr. Garland told reporters.

The indictment was the first of a Russian oligarch in the United States since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said.

Mr. Garland also announced the “disruption” of a global botnet controlled by the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. “The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets,” he said. “Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used.

“Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices,” the attorney general said. “We were then able to disable the GRU’s control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponised.” — AFP

UK’s PM says Bucha killings in Ukraine not ‘far short of genocide’

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday the alleged massacre of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops in the town of Bucha “doesn’t look far short of genocide to me”.

The UK government has consistently refused to use the word “genocide” with regard to Ukraine and other conflicts, arguing that designating the worst of war crimes is up a competent court. But Mr. Johnson told reporters: “I’m afraid when you look at what’s happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what (Vladimir) Putin has done in Ukraine doesn’t look far short of genocide to me.

“It is no wonder people are responding in the way that they are,” the prime minister added.

“I have no doubt that the international community, Britain very much in the front rank, will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin’s regime.” - AFP

Turkey calls for probe into civilian deaths in Bucha

Turkey on Wednesday joined the global condemnation of the murder of civilians in the town of Bucha and other cities in Ukraine and called for an independent investigation.

U.S. to announce new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine killings

The United States was expected to announce tough new sanctions on Russia Wednesday, including a ban on new investments, a day after Ukraine’s president showed the UN Security Council harrowing images of violence and accused Moscow of widespread atrocities.

The sanctions come after an outcry over the discovery of dozens of bodies in civilian clothing in areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn around Ukraine’s capital, including the town of Bucha. -AFP

U.S. to ban ‘all new investment’ in Russia on Wednesday: source

The United States, in coordination with the G7 and European Union, will ban “all” new investments in Russia on Wednesday in its latest round of sanctions, a source said.

The joint measures, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and alleged carrying out of atrocities, “will include a ban on all new investment in Russia, increased sanctions on financial institutions and state-owned enterprises in Russia, and sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members,” the source familiar with the sanctions told AFP Tuesday. -AFP

Finland boosts defence spending by 2 bn euros over Ukraine

Finland announced Tuesday it would increase its military spending by more than two billion euros over the next four years, saying the decision was spurred on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The decision to increase the defence budget follows unusually short budget negotiations in the Nordic country that shares Europe’s longest land border with Russia.

“The war in Europe has fundamentally changed our security environment,” Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said in a statement. -AFP

New Zealand introduces new sanctions, tariffs on Russian imports

The New Zealand government said on Wednesday it was introducing a 35% tariff on all imports from Russia and would extend existing export prohibitions to industrial products closely connected to strategic Russian industries.

Russia’s Lavrov says Bucha war crime claims aim to ‘torpedo’ Ukraine talks

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said the discovery of bodies in the Ukrainian town of Bucha was a “provocation” aimed at scuppering talks between Moscow and Kyiv.

https://www.greenriverstar.com/story/2022/03/31/county/big-nose-george-an-outlaw-with-a-disturbing-history/9277.html,Big Nose George: An outlaw with a disturbing history,"Wyoming claims several famous outlaws with wild stories, but none as strange as disturbing as the story of ""Big Nose"" George Parrott. The remarkable nature of his story has less to do with his life, however, and more to do with his death and what followed.

During his life, Parrott was a relatively common Wyoming outlaw. He was arrested for horse theft but acquitted. He was also believed to have kept headquarters in the Hole-in-the-Wall country west of present-day Kaycee with a number of other outlaws of the time.

Perhaps one of Big Nose George's most ambitious criminal enterprises was what led to his grisly end. Parrott and his gang planned a train robbery but botched the attempt.

They fled to Elk Mountain and were tracked by Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy Robert Widdowfield and Union Pacific detective Henry ""Tip"" Vincent. When the lawmen found the gang Aug. 19, 1878, Big Nose George and his men murdered them.

Parrott and his men committed other crimes before Big Nose George was finally caught in Montana two years later. Those in Wyoming hadn't forgotten about the murdered lawmen. Parrott was tried in Rawlins, where he was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to hang.

Ten days before his execution, Big Nose George tried to escape, using a pocketknife to saw through the rivets on his leg shackles and using the shackles to knock out the jailer, Robert Rankin. The jailer's wife, however, closed the door and fired her husband's revolver in the air, stopping the outlaw's plan. A group of men came running to help, but they didn't just secure Parrott. They decided it was time for him to die.

The mob tried to hang Big Nose George but the rope broke and the outlaw asked to be shot.

The men didn't listen, however, and simply replaced the noose and made Parrott climb a 12-foot ladder instead of the kerosene barrel they'd tried the first time. The men used leg irons to weigh him down, and this time the rope didn't break. One report estimated the crowd that gathered to watch was close to 200 people.

Parrott's biggest claim to fame, however, doesn't come from his crimes or his lynching. It comes from the disturbing fate of his body after his death.

Dr. John Osborne, a Rawlin's physician, had been asked to be present during the hanging to ensure the outlaw died. He and another Rawlins doctor, Thomas Maghee, claimed Parrott's body. Maghee removed Parrott's brain for study and gave part of the skull to his protégé, Lillian Heath, who later became Wyoming's first female physician. Osborne made a death mask from Parrott's face, then skinned large portions of the body, had the skin tanned, and incorporated it into a pair of shoes. Years later, he wore the shoes to his inaugural ball when he was elected Governor of Wyoming.

The Carbon County Museum in Rawlins has a Big Nose George exhibit which includes his death mask, a cast of his skull, and Dr. Osborne's shoes made from his tanned skin.

The Sweetwater County Historical Museum has Parott's handgun, a .44-caliber Remington New Model Army, as part of the ""Firearms of the American West - Single Action Revolvers"" exhibit.

The museum also has a new book on Parrott's life available in the book shop. ""Big Nose George - His Troublesome Trail"" was written by Mark E. Miller, who served for 30 years as Wyoming State Archaeologist. Dick Blust, a staff member at the museum, said this books is extensively researched, compellingly written, and easily the most authoritative work on the case yet produced.

A shorter summary of Big Nose George's life can also be found in the article ""Big Nose George: A Grisly Frontier Tale"" by Lori Van Pelt, available on WyoHistory.org.",Q2

In these moments, it’s tempting to imagine a city rooted in forms of solidarity organised outside of a deeply corrupt and ineffective state.

But it seems that these glimpses of a society, of a more humane society, have their limits.

They don’t seem to extend to solidarity with the political organising of the poor. DM168 has, to its great credit, given serious attention to the assassination of two Abahlali baseMjondolo leaders in the past month. However, much of the media has been silent.

As Raymond Suttner has noted in DM168, most of the big civil society organisations have been silent too. The same is true of most intellectuals and many religious organisations. There is a general lack of interest among the middle classes, and most but not all trade unions too, in the fact that the leaders of the largest social movement in the country, a movement of the poorest of the poor, are being systematically assassinated.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has been silent, as has Police Minister Bheki Cele, and there has not been a word of protest from the South African Communist Party. The silence of the ruling elite is a clear indication that they are not greatly troubled by the ongoing assassinations of grassroots activists.

I am reminded, once again, of the point made by the great American intellectual Noam Chomsky. Chomsky, famously referred to as “arguably the most important intellectual alive”, reminds us: “… worthy victims will be featured prominently and dramatically, that they will be humanised, and that their victimisation will receive the detail and context in story construction that will generate reader interest and sympathetic emotion. In contrast, unworthy victims will merit only slight detail, minimal humanisation and little context that will excite and enrage.”

Moments like this lead one to despair for the future of our democracy. If grassroots activists can be murdered with impunity – whether in Abahlali baseMjondolo or in anti-mining or any other struggles – then, although we live in a country that holds elections, we are not living in a democracy.

If solidarity only takes the form of assistance after disasters, like the riots, the floods and regular shack fires, it is not real solidarity – it is charity.

Charity is necessary in periods of disaster, but it is not real solidarity.

Real solidarity is true generosity, it goes beyond the essential need to provide food and blankets after a disaster and extends to real partnership; partnership that includes a defence of the rights of everybody to participate in democratic life.

When most of civil society, much of the media, most of the intelligentsia, most religious organisations, most trade unions and most of middle-class society in general are silent in the face of regular assassinations of grassroots activists, they are, ultimately, complicit. There is a disquieting question that must be asked: are the organised working class and the institutions and civil society and religious organisations of the middle classes really democrats? DM168

Imran Khan said he will be going to Sialkot today, let there be no doubt.

14 May,2022 01:42 pm

ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday said that what ‘imported’ government did in Sialkot against party leadership and workers is outrageous but not unexpected.

Imran Khan, in a series of tweets, said that he will be going to Sialkot today, let there be no doubt.

Former prime minister lambasted government and said, “This bunch of criminals out on bail and their convict mafia boss in London have always used fascist tactics against opponents”.

He further said, “when they are in power - storming of SC, Model Town murders, bribing judges, Nawaz Sharif trying to declare himself Amir ul Momineen. They use and abuse democracy when in opposition and totally destroy all democratic norms when in power. But people have now risen against them”.

“Our government never stopped any of their jalsas (rallies) and sit-ins because we are committed to democracy. I will be in Sialkot today & I am calling on all our people to come out and protest in their areas/cities after Isha prayers against this fascist imported government.”

It merits mention that PTI has announced to change venue of public rally to VIP ground after police crackdown on party workers and arrest of Usman Dar.

PTI Punjab President Shafqat Mahmood, while addressing a press conference with other party leaders, said that their peaceful party workers were tortured by police and claimed that police action was launched on direction of Khawaja Asif.

The former minister strongly condemned arrests of PTI leaders and workers and demanded their immediate release and reiterated that rally will be held in the city no matter what.

The PTI leader said that they want to exercise their rights in a democratic manner and asked government to come to senses. He added that government is bent on using force and warned that government will be responsible if something untoward happens.

Earlier, police arrested PTI leader Usman Dar and after a scuffle broke out between PTI workers and police at the venue of PTI chief Imran Khan’s public meeting.

Police entered the venue of PTI public meeting claiming that the district administration had not allowed the party to hold public meeting at CTI Ground in Sialkot.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Columbus Division of Police has identified the suspect who reportedly fatally shot a woman in North Linden in February.

Police said 31-year-old Dallas Lowery is charged with murder in the shooting death of 33-year-old Heather Chapman.

Officers responded to the 1700 block of Melrose Avenue on Feb. 22 around 9:15 p.m. for a shooting.

Upon arrival, they found 33-year-old Heather Chapman suffering from a gunshot wound. Medics pronounced her dead at 9:22 p.m.

At the time, homicide detectives were called to the scene to begin an investigation due to suspicious circumstances.

According to a filing in Franklin County Municipal Court, an officer wrote that Lowery initially called police saying Chapman had died by suicide.

As officers investigated, they could not find the gun at the scene.

Police wrote in the affidavit that Chapman initially refused to make a statement but admitted over a phone conversation that he was the only one with Chapman when she was shot.

According to court records, witnesses said that Lowery gave the gun to a friend to get rid of the night of the shooting. Police found the gun with the reported friend and the gun matched the shell casing at the scene.

Police said Chapman’s death is the 16th homicide in Columbus in 2022.

Lowery is currently being held in Delaware County Jail on unrelated charges that stem from an incident in 2021.

Court records show that Lowery pleaded guilty in Aug. 2021 to resisting arrest and spitting on a law enforcement officer.

He was sentenced in Sept. 2021 to two years of community control sanctions.

Records show that he was arrested on April 27 for ""failing to abide with community control sanctions"" and a Delaware County judge ordered him to be held another 100 days in jail.",Q2

Still, some of his speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday attempted to elicit a change of heart in his colleagues.

Children who returned to school at Sandy Hook after the shooting had to be taught a safeword to use when they were reliving moments from the attack, like stepping over their classmates’ bodies as they fled, Mr. Murphy said.

“In one classroom, that word was ‘monkey,’” he recounted, describing how teachers would then talk the children through their flashbacks. “And over and over and over through the day, kids would stand up and yell, ‘Monkey!’”

“Why?” Mr. Murphy exclaimed. “Why are we here if not to try to make sure that fewer schools and fewer communities go through what Sandy Hook has gone through? What Uvalde is going through?”",Q2

U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor issued an order Friday that would lead to the trial being held during a two-week period that begins Feb. 13. Before then, plaintiffs challenging the law are expected to pursue a preliminary injunction, while the state likely will seek dismissal of the case.

The law, which passed during this year’s legislative session and has drawn heavy national attention, will take effect July 1. It bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade and requires that such instruction in older grades be “age-appropriate … in accordance with state academic standards.”

Republican lawmakers titled the measure the “Parental Rights in Education” bill. But opponents dubbed it the “don’t say gay” bill. Groups such as the LGBTQ-advocacy organization Equality Florida, parents, students and a teacher filed a federal lawsuit March 31 challenging the measure.

Secret Service rented the $6 million “Spanish-style estate” with “six bedrooms, six bathrooms, a gym, a tasting room, a built-in barbecue, a pool, a spa,” and “gorgeous ocean views” in the same neighborhood as Hunter, who is under federal investigation for potential tax crimes and scrutiny for his shady overseas business dealings. Hunter’s own lavish living space in Malibu features a “spacious park-like yard” with “a pool, a spa, a built-in barbecue bar, and alfresco dining.”

A retired senior Secret Service agent quoted by ABC blamed the security agency’s pricey and lavish living choice on the expensive housing market.

While it’s customary for Secret Service to offer protection to family members of the president, the Malibu mansion rental is not the first time the agency has reached beyond its duties to accommodate the young Biden or rescue him from criminal situations.

In the fall of 2016, a Hertz rental car office in Arizona discovered a crack pipe, white powder, credit cards, and Beau Biden’s attorney general badge in a car Hunter had rented. The rental agency reported the drug paraphernalia discovery to local police, who filed a narcotics offense report but later decided not to charge the Biden son after Secret Service agents got involved and claimed Hunter was “secure/well.”

Secret Service also reportedly tried to interfere in an investigation into Hunter’s gun, which he seems to have purchased illegally and which went temporarily missing after his late brother’s wife and then-love interest threw it away in a trash can near a grocery store in 2018.

When police got involved after the .38 revolver went missing, two Secret Service agents equipped with “badges and identification cards” reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter purchased the firearm earlier that month and demanded that the owner turn over the Firearms Transaction Record used during the purchase. The store owner refused because he “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime.”

The Secret Service later denied any official involvement in the situation, citing that the Biden family’s official protection only spanned from 2009 to 2017. Secret Service formally resumed protection for Hunter in June 2020 shortly after his father won the Democratic presidential nomination and added more security detail after Biden assumed office but “kept an informal hand in maintaining the former vice president’s security” even between 2017 and 2020.

Humans don't know what they're missing under the surface of a busy shipping channel in the “cruise capital of the world.” Just below the keels of massive ships, an underwater camera provides a live feed from another world, showing marine life that's trying its best to resist global warming.

That camera in Miami's Government Cut is just one of the many ventures of a marine biologist and a musician who've been on a 15-year mission to raise awareness about dying coral reefs by combining science and art to bring undersea life into pop culture.

Their company — Coral Morphologic — is surfacing stunning images, putting gorgeous closeups of underwater creatures on social media, setting time-lapsed video of swaying, glowing coral to music and projecting it onto buildings, even selling a coral-themed beachwear line.

“We aren’t all art. We aren’t all science. We aren’t all tech. We are an alchemy,” said Colin Foord, who defies the looks of a typical scientist, with blue hair so spiky that it seems electrically charged. He and his business partner J.D. McKay sat down with The Associated Press to show off their work.

One of their most popular projects is the Coral City Camera, which recently passed 2 million views and usually has about 100 viewers online at any given time each day.

“We’re going to actually be able to document one year of coral growth, which has never been done before in situ on a coral reef, and that’s only possible because we have this technological connection right here at the port of Miami that allows us to have power and internet,” Foord said.

The livestream has already revealed that staghorn and other corals can adapt and thrive even in a highly urbanized undersea environment, along with 177 species of fish, dolphins, manatees and other sea life, Foord said.

“We have these very resilient corals growing here. The primary goal of us getting it underwater was to show people there is so much marine life right here in our city,” Foord said.

McKay, meanwhile, sounds like a Broadway producer as he describes how he also films the creatures in their Miami lab, growing coral in tanks to get them ready for closeups in glorious color.

“We essentially create a set with one of these aquariums, and then obviously there's actors — coral or shrimp or whatever — and then we film it, and then I get a vibe, whatever might be happening in the scene, and then I soundtrack it with some ambient like sounds, something very oceanic,"" McKay explained.

Their latest production, “ Coral City Flourotour, ” will be shown on the New World Center Wallscape this week as the Aspen Institute hosts a major climate conference in Miami Beach. Foord is speaking on a panel about how the ocean’s natural systems can help humans learn to combat impacts of climate change. The talk’s title? “The Ocean is a Superhero.”

""I think when we can recognize that we're all this one family of life and everything is interconnected, that hopefully we can make meaningful changes now, so that future generations don't have to live in a world of wildfires and melted ice caps and dead oceans,"" Foord told the AP.

Their mission is urgent: After 500 million years on Earth, these species are under assault from climate change. The warming oceans prompt coral bleaching and raise the risk of infectious diseases that can cause mass die-offs in coral, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Stronger storms and changes in water chemistry can destroy reef structures, while altered currents sweep away food and larvae.

“Climate change is the greatest global threat to coral reef ecosystems,” NOAA said in a recent report.

That gets at the second part of Coral Morphologic's name. “What does it mean to be morphologic? It really means having to adapt because the environment is always changing,” Foord said.

The staghorn, elkhorn and brain coral living in Government Cut provide a real-world example of how coral communities can adapt to such things as rising heat and polluted runoff, even in such an unlikely setting as the port of Miami. Their video has documented fluorescence in some of the coral, an unusual response in offshore waters that Foord said could be protecting them from solar rays.

“The port is a priceless place for coral research,"" Foord said. “We have to be realistic. You won't be able to return the ecosystems to the way they were 200 years ago. The options we are left with are more radical.”

Beyond the science, there's the clothes. Coral Morphologic sells a line of surf and swimwear that takes designs from flower anemones and brain coral and uses environmentally sustainable materials such as a type of nylon recycled from old fishing nets.

“We see the power of tech connecting people with nature. We are lucky as artists, and corals are benefitting,” Foord said.

LAHORE (Dunya News) – Workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Monday staged a protest demonstration outside a local hotel in the provincial capital where members of the joint opposition were staying.

It is pertinent here to mention that the Speaker Punjab Assembly had adjourned the sitting of the provincial assembly on Sunday after which the opposition members had refused to leave the house but later the opposition decided that the members would not go home till the election of the Chief Minister.

The workers of the PTI chanted slogans against the opposition members, while the opposition members came out of the hotel and sent the women members back to the hotel.

Citizens faced difficulties due to road closures around the hotel, and severe traffic congestion was seen in the Gulberg area.

Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Imran Nazir held talks with the police and administration after which he took his fellow members inside the hotel.",Q2

JOSH Duggar has been released from an Arkansas jail to continue to serve his 12-year child pornography sentence in federal prison.

Josh, 34, was sentenced to 12 years behind bars for receiving child pornography on May 25 after he was found guilty of the crime back in December.

Since the sentencing, Josh has been in Washington County Jail in Arkansas awaiting transfer to either FCI Seagoville or FCI Texarkana in Texas depending on availability.

The Washington County Jail exclusively confirmed to The Sun Josh is no longer in their custody.

They were unable to confirm where he is being transferred for safety reasons.

His status on the Federal Bureau of Prisons has not been updated to reflect his current location.

REUNITED

The release comes after Josh’s wife Anna, 34, revealed she is going on a “road trip” to see her “bestie.”

Anna posted on her Instagram: “Officially 34. 14 years since I said, ‘Yes.’ Road-tripping to visit my bestie.

""'Even if' by Mercy Me on repeat. ‘Jesus will cling to you. Come what may.’""

LONG WAIT

Josh has been behind bars in the Arkansas jail since May because of overcrowding, The Sun previously reported.

A legal source explained: “It’s a waiting game and that's normal! The jail has no control over when the federal government transports him out of Washington County.

“Jails are crowded, it takes time to ‘decide’ on a facility, find an open bed, arrange transfer and more. The system moves slow. It's impossible to know a timeline.”

The insider continued to The Sun: “Prisons and jails are jam-packed. The two facilities they are asking for are small, like 1,700 people small.""

COVID FEARS

The Sun previously reported Seagoville facility, where his legal team recommended he go, made headlines in 2020 for having over 72% of its population infected with COVID.

CNN reported in August of 2020 that at least three inmates had died at that point, with one of the inmate's family members calling the facility a ""petri dish.""

DANGEROUS CONDITIONS

Beyond widespread disease, there have been a number of assaults inside the prison walls over the years.

According to a release by the Department of Justice ""John Hall, 27, an Aryan Brotherhood member and inmate"" at the facility, attacked and assaulted a fellow inmate because he believed he was gay.

""Hall repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the victim’s face with his shod feet, a dangerous weapon, while yelling a homophobic slur.

""The victim lost consciousness during the assault and suffered multiple lacerations to his face. The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, and fractured other teeth,"" the release read.

In another instance, according to CBS, a correction officer was arrested for abusive sexual contact with an inmate at FCI Seagoville, the officer resigned and was sentenced to one year behind bars.

In another instance, the Bureau of Prisons and the Seagoville warden at the time were sued by an inmate over the conditions within the facility in a civil rights action.

In a complaint reviewed by The Sun, the inmate alleged that overcrowding exacerbated a number of conditions inmates faced inside the prison.

The inmate, Jed Lineberry, said the overcrowding added to an ""increased exposure to a violent environment,"" among a slew of other allegations in the federal filing.

His claims were ultimately dismissed since he had already been transferred to the Texarkana facility.

According to the BOP website, FCI Seagoville has a Sex Offender Management Program (SOMP) and in 2018 it was estimated that around 40% of the inmates there were sex offenders.

JOSH'S SENTENCING

Honorable Judge Timothy L Brooks sentenced Josh to 151 months in prison on May 25.

According to The Sun's court reporter, Josh appeared stoic as he received his sentence, which also includes $50,100 in fines.

As he read his decision, the judge called Josh's crimes ""the sickest of the sick"" to the packed courtroom.

He then said to Josh: ""You have done some very bad things. But in your life as a whole, you've done good things... The true test of a man's character is what a man does when no one is watching.""

Referring to Josh's insistence that he's innocent, the judge continued: ""I find it aggravating about the lack of responsibility.""

Judge Brooks recommended Josh participate in the Bureau of Prison's sex offender treatment program.

In the molestation police report, Jim Bob told authorities his son was sent to a Christian counseling program where he did “manual labor and had counseling.”

When prosecutors fought for a 20-year sentence on the child pornography charges, they feared Josh would not get the proper counseling and would re-offend again.

The father of seven filed to appeal the sentence.

https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/shireen-abu-akleh-legal-mechanisms-available-justice-and-accountability,Shireen Abu Akleh killing: The legal mechanisms available for justice,"The killing of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli authorities is continuously glossed over in western media as collateral damage in a battle between Israeli forces and Palestinian combatants.

But while many deaths of innocents are overlooked, some come with increased diplomatic and legal pressure for the US and other western countries that are close allies to Israel.

In the case of Shireen Abu Akleh's killing at the hands of Israeli forces, her status as a journalist and a US citizen opens pathways for potential punitive measures for those responsible, and also gives her family and loved ones a number of mechanisms to pursue justice on a global stage.

'The US government ... should be taking the lead on actually conducting an investigation and not relying on the Israelis' - Adam Shapiro, Democracy for the Arab World Now

Both within the US and on the international level, legal experts and rights advocates say there are multiple ways to seek accountability over the killing, and a number of precedents that pave the way for investigations and civil litigations.

Abu Akleh, a veteran journalist of more than 25 years at Al Jazeera, was shot and killed on Wednesday morning during an Israeli raid in the Palestinian village of Jenin. While Israeli authorities have launched an investigation into the matter, they have already walked back their initial claim that it was a Palestinian gunman who shot her.

New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters

Multiple eyewitnesses, including Middle East Eye contributor Shatha Hanaysa, assert that Abu Akleh came under Israeli sniper fire.

The Israeli investigation is still in its infancy, but an initial probe stated she was killed about 300 feet from Israeli forces and that the Israeli army's elite Duvdevan Unit did fire several rounds in the direction of where Abu Akleh and other journalists were positioned.

Israel has said it will cooperate with Palestinian authorities, as well as Qatar - Abu Akleh's employer Al Jazeera is a Qatari state-affiliated news agency.

Still, rights advocates have issued concerns over Israel's investigation into the killing, noting that previous investigations have led nowhere, including a recent probe into the death of Omar Asad, an 80-year-old Palestinian with US citizenship who died under Israeli custody earlier this year.

""It's clear that based on the documented track record of the Israeli military and government that they have a pattern of not investigating cases in which their forces are involved in the killing of civilians, journalists, and then on top of that, American citizens and other foreign nationals,"" said Adam Shapiro, advocacy director for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now.

""The US government, which has a stake in this case, because Shireen was an American citizen, should be taking the lead on actually conducting an investigation and not relying on the Israelis to investigate.""

Shapiro noted there is a precedent to show the US can take a lead in investigating Abu Akleh's death, citing the case of Daniel Pearl, an American journalist who was kidnapped and killed in Pakistan in 2002. The US sent FBI agents to investigate the matter alongside cooperative Pakistani officials.

""So in this case with the Israelis - there were previous cases with the Israelis - we can assume that the Israelis would be a little bit hostile, and we know they're not always interested in investigating these claims,"" Shapiro said.

""So there's even more of a reason why the US should be assisting in a case like this.""

'A matter of effectiveness'

The United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC) could also play a role in the investigation. Both the ICC and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have launched probes into Israeli war crimes, the latter of which will present its first findings next month.

""This is an avenue that already exists. It was mandated a year ago. Just next month, we're going to see the first reaction,"" said Sherif Mansour, Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, referring to the UN's investigation.

Shireen Abu Akleh: How Western media failed slain Palestinian journalist Read More »

""And I think this is a case where the timing of [the killing] should be informing the findings and recommendations of the report that will come out in June,"" he told MEE.

UN officials have already called for an independent probe into the matter. Mansour said this is because Israel has continued to show its ineffectiveness at dealing with the killing of journalists.

""It's not just a matter of jurisdiction. It's a matter of effectiveness. We at the committee documented last year a journalist who was killed in an Israeli bombing in his home, and they're still investigating whether that was direct targeting or not,"" he said.

""There are at least 18 journalists that we've counted since 1992 who have been killed by the Israeli or Palestinian sides, and none of those cases have seen any accountability against the perpetrators.

""This is why a UN investigation and this is why the Human Rights Council have moved. They don't usually move until all the local and regional accountability mechanisms have been exhausted.""

Laws and sanctions

Despite the pessimism towards an Israeli probe, there are several ways in which lawmakers in the US and Europe could punish those directly involved in the killing.

In the US, the Global Magnitsky Act could be invoked to impose sanctions on the individuals or group that is responsible for shooting the Palestinian journalist. Since being signed into law in 2016, the act has been used by the US government to impose sanctions on individuals in China, Guatemala, Cuba, Bulgaria, and others in several countries.

""The Magnitsky Act would also be able to impose sanctions then on those individuals who were the unit of the military that's been involved,"" Shapiro said.

The European Union also has its own version of this law, the European Magnitsky Act, and could use it to similarly sanction the individuals involved in the shooting of Abu Akleh.

There is also the Leahy Law, a US law named after Senator Patrick Leahy, which could be invoked to bar the US government from providing military assistance to foreign security forces responsible for gross human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings.

While Shapiro said that it is unlikely that either act would be used against Israel given its status as a close US ally, the killing of Abu Akleh fits within the parameters of the laws.

However, ""Unfortunately, both the Magnitsky Act and the Leahy Law don't really have much to do with accountability in terms of the actual killing itself, from the perspective of who the individual perpetrator was,"" he added.

Take it to US courts

For Abu Akleh's family, her US nationality also affords them a number of opportunities to seek redress in American courts - options not available to foreign nationals.

""Every killing is tragic, obviously, especially unlawful killings of civilians, but there are different options available in US courts when it is a US national who was killed,"" Gissou Nia, a human rights lawyer and director of the Strategic Litigation Project at the Atlantic Council, told MEE.

'Every killing is tragic ... but there are different options available in US courts when it is a US national who was killed' - Gissou Nia, human rights lawyer

One of those options is through the war crimes statute within Title 18 of the US criminal code, which allows for the Department of Justice to bring charges against the perpetrators of war crimes.

""The key thing about the war crime statute is that it allows for what's called nationality jurisdiction, meaning either the alleged perpetrator is a US national or the victim is a US national,"" Nia said.

""That's an option that's available. We saw this being discussed with respect to American journalists who have been recently killed or injured in Ukraine by Russian forces.""

Another option that could be used is the Torture Victim Prevention Act of 1991, which allows US citizens and non-US citizens to file civil lawsuits in alleged cases of torture or extrajudicial killings committed in foreign countries.

This act has been cited in several lawsuits over the past several years, including when Egyptian-American activist Mohamed Soltan sued former Egyptian Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi for allegedly being responsible for his torture in an Egyptian prison.

A number of civilian families have also used the act to file lawsuits against Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar for allegedly being responsible for both the torture and extrajudicial killings of their family members during the country's civil war.

Soltan's case was thrown out after the US government intervened, while the litigation in Haftar's case is still ongoing.

In Abu Akleh's case, Nia said that her death would likely fall under the category of extrajudicial killing, making a legal case through this act a viable option for her family.

Legal precedents

If Abu Akleh's family were to take this case to court, it would not be the first time that the killing of a US journalist would be deliberated over in the American legal system.

Marie Colvin, an American journalist and war correspondent for the Sunday Times, was killed in a rocket attack on a makeshift media centre in the rebel-held city of Homs in February 2012.

Initial Israeli probe says Shireen Abu Akleh was 300 feet from army when killed Read More »

Her family lodged a claim against the Syrian government in a court in Washington citing the terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which says that a foreign country on the US state sponsor of terror list can be sued over the extrajudicial killing of a US national.

In 2019, the court ruled that the Syrian government had to pay $300m in damages to Colvin's family.

Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident and Saudi columnist for Middle East Eye and The Washington Post, was killed in 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in a murder that US intelligence assessed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for.

A court case in Turkey was thrown out earlier this year, but one lawsuit against the Saudi government over Khashoggi's killing remains in a US court in Washington, although it has yet to rule on whether the US has jurisdiction over the case.

Still, Nia noted that whenever it comes to crimes committed abroad, ""there's inevitably a foreign policy component"" that gets in the way of seeking accountability.

""Sometimes, as you saw in the case of Mohamed Soltan, that can affect what moves forward very differently from when we're dealing with purely domestic criminal prosecutions and civil suits.""",Q2

Abortion rights supporters demonstrate in Winston-Salem after leaked draft court opinion.","A group of 33 abortion rights supporters demonstrated Tuesday in downtown Winston-Salem in response to a leaked draft opinion that suggests the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn the 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

The demonstrators gathered in front of the Ward Federal Building and then walked to the sidewalk along Main Street. The protesters displayed their signs toward drivers on Main Street.

Some of the signs said, “Abortion is Healthcare,” “My Body, My Choice,” “Access to Abortion is a Basic Right,” “80% of Americans Want Legal Abortion. Don’t Move Backward,” “Women’s Rights Are Human Rights,” “We Are Not Going Back,” “Men 4 Women” and “Protect Women.”

If the Supreme Court overturns Roe, that decision would likely lead to abortion bans in nearly half of the states and could affect the outcome of the November elections. The court cautioned Tuesday that the draft does not represent its final word on the landmark 49-year-old case.

The draft opinion states there is no constitutional right to abortion services, and it would allow individual states to more heavily regulate or outright ban the procedure. Associate Justice Samuel Alito, a member of the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, signed the opinion.

In Winston-Salem, the abortion rights demonstrators moved to the intersection of Main and Second streets and displayed their signs to drivers on both streets.

Many drivers honked their horns and yelled in support of the protesters.

Wayne Stroller of Kernersville, a demonstrator, said he wasn’t surprised by the draft opinion.

“Alito’s reasoning is disingenuous because the court has sustained women’s rights to an abortion in previous rulings,” Stroller said.

State Sen. Paul Lowe Jr., D-Forsyth, and State Rep. Evelyn Terry, D-Forsyth, criticized the court’s draft opinion.

“The news of this decision is alarming but not surprising,” Lowe said. “The right to choose should be protected, and I thoroughly disagree with the statements in the leaked opinion draft.”

Lowe said he has always supported a woman’s right to choose what she does with her body.

“I hope that the Supreme Court redirects its decision in a direction that reflects that sentiment,” Lowe said.

Terry described the draft opinion as an “assault on freedom,” she said.

“The U.S. Supreme Court granted women this right 49 years ago,” Terry said. “Privilege obviously has no boundaries.”

State Rep. Lee Zachary, R-Forysth, said that it was unfortunate that the court’s draft opinion was publicly leaked.

“The employees take an oath of confidentiality, and disclosing court documents is forbidden,” Zachary said. “This appears to be a draft. Whether it’s a majority draft or a draft by one justice is what is unknown. It certainly chips away at the public’s confidence in the court.”

At a Raleigh news conference, Bobbie Richardson, the chairwoman of the N.C. Democratic Party, said that voters must elect Democrats to protect women’s abortion rights.

“To be clear, this is a draft opinion,” Richardson said. “It is not the final word yet. Abortion is still safe and legal in North Carolina.”

However, Richardson said, if the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, that decision would be “devastating for the millions of people across North Carolina, whose abortion access and control over their bodies now hang in the balance.”

The draft opinion reflects anti-abortion group’s plant to ban abortions across the United States, Richardson said.

“Make no mistake, North Carolina Democrats will continue to fight like hell to protect the rights to access safe, legal abortion,” Richardson said.

Jeanne Mancini, the president of March for Life, an anti-group, tweeted Tuesday that she was saddened by the leak of the draft opinion, “and how toxic and damaging such an action is to our judiciary.”

Mancini said that she was “blown away by the breadth, clarity and truth” of the draft opinion after she read it.

If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, then “the chaos of an erroneously decided decision 50 years ago that has had such a profoundly negative impact on our culture and all women and men would finally be set right,” Mancini said.

At the protest, Reina Hendren of Winston-Salem, a demonstrator, said she attended the rally because “I don’t think politics belong in women’s rights.”

Tonya Haizlip, a protester, agreed with Hendren.

“I feel like the whole Supreme Court decision, and what they are trying to do is an assault on women’s rights,” Haizlip said. “Countless young women and children are raped and assaulted, and a pregnancy results, adding to their trauma.

“Young girls can’t be out here,” Haizlip said. “We can be out here and fight for them.”

Rebecca Silberman of Winston-Salem, another demonstrator, said that Supreme Court’s official ruling on Roe vs. Wade will not stop abortions.

“Abortions will happen no matter if they legal are not,” Silberman said. “Roe protects a woman’s right to choose and for the safety of their body.

“So repealing Roe will mean that poor and single women will be forced to have their children,” Silberman said. “It keeps people without access in bad situations. Rich women will always be to get an abortion no matter the law.”",Q2
https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/pakistan-elects-sharif-as-new-pm-after-khan-s-ouster/6524259.html,Pakistan Elects Sharif as New PM after Khan’s Ouster,"Pakistan’s parliament elected opposition lawmaker Shahbaz Sharif as prime minister Monday. He replaces Imran Khan, whom Parliament had voted out of office early Sunday.

Shahbaz Sharif was elected with 174 votes after more than 100 lawmakers from Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or Pakistan Justice Party, left the National Assembly in protest.

“Mohammad Shahbaz Sharif is declared to be the prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” announced the acting speaker, Asad Sadiq.

Sharif is the younger brother of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The older Sharif was forced to resign from office after a corruption investigation.

Shahbaz Sharif will have just enough votes to pass laws in the 342-seat assembly.

Imran Khan served as Pakistan’s prime minister for three years and eight months. On April 3, Khan tried to avoid a vote to withdraw support for his leadership. He dismissed Parliament and called for early elections.

The opposition appealed to the nation’s Supreme Court and it ruled to return the dismissed Parliament to power four days later.

On Sunday night, Khan urged hundreds of thousands of supporters to protest his ouster. He described the new leadership as an “imposed government.” Khan’s supporters marched in cities across Pakistan.

Khan has demanded that elections be held before August 2023, the date set. He also accuses the opposition of working with the United States to remove him from power. He said he was targeted because of his independent foreign policy favoring China and Russia. The U.S. State Department has denied any involvement in Pakistani politics.

Khan was also criticized for a visit he made on February 24 to Moscow. He held talks there with Russian President Vladimir Putin as Russian tanks invaded Ukraine.

The largest among Pakistan’s opposition parties — the Pakistan People’s Party, led by the son of murdered former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and the Pakistan Muslim League, headed by Shahbaz Sharif — have been damaged by reports of widespread corruption.

Nawaz Sharif served as Pakistan’s prime minster three times. He was ousted in a military overthrow in 1999 and removed again by the Supreme Court in 2015. After he was found guilty of financial wrongdoings, Nawaz was banned from holding office and left Pakistan.

Benazir Bhutto served two terms as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s. Bhutto was killed in a 2007 suicide attack while campaigning. She was the daughter of former president and prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who served as president of Pakistan after 2008 elections, has spent more than seven years in prison, after a court ruled him guilty of corruption.

Khan came to power in 2018, promising to break family rule in Pakistan. His opponents claimed he won the elections with help from the powerful military. The military has ruled Pakistan for half of the country’s 75-year history.

Press TV, Indian-Controlled Kashmir

During the past week, Kashmir witnessed two targeted killings: a non-local bank manager from the western Indian state of Rajasthan and a Kashmiri pandit school teacher. Fear has once again gripped the troubled valley region and local minority Hindus known as Kashmir Pandits fear a repeat of the 1990s scenario.

At that time, full-blown insurgency against Indian rule had begun in Kashmir and the Muslim majority population was up in arms against the Indian rule, seeking an independent Kashmir or a merger with Pakistan.

Scores of families who had returned to Kashmir valley after a relief and rehabilitation package was announced by the Indian prime minister in 2010 are once again seeking an exit from the trouble-torn valley and accuse the government of faking normalcy in Kashmir.

Since the abrogation of Kashmir's semi-autonomous status in August 2019, there has been a sharp rise in attacks against Kashmiri pandits and nonlocals. Anti-India militia in Kashmir see the pundits, non-locals and even the local Muslims employed in the government sectors, like police and other departments, as collaborators of the Indian regime in this Muslim-majority region.

Since the beginning of the year 2022, a total of 16 targeted killings occurred in Kashmir; 12 of which targeted Muslims. In Muslim-majority Kashmir, for centuries Hindus and Muslims have lived side by side in harmony. However, the political turmoil in the region in the early 1990s forced more than 250,000 Kashmiri Hindus to flee.

According to government estimates, a total of 209 Kashmiri Hindus were killed between 1989 to 2008 and this forced their mass migration from the valley region. Kashmiri Muslims support the return of Hindus to the valley, but oppose the idea of separate settlements being given to them.

Since Kashmir's special status was eroded in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP government has implemented new laws and policies that local Muslims say are aimed at changing the demographics of the region. Kashmir valley is the world's largest militarized zone with estimates saying more than half a million Indian soldiers are stationed in the valley.

After the fresh spate of violence, New Delhi has ordered reinforcement ahead of the annual Hindu pilgrimage. Suspecting more targeted attacks, security has been beefed up in and around Kashmir.

Amid mounting tensions, the Indian administration has denied the relocation demand of Kashmiri Hindus. However, fearing a repeat of the 1990s, many have already started to flee the region, saying their lives matter and no politicking in the name of Kashmir pandits.",Q2

KARACHI, May 13 (Gwadar Pro) - A memorial service was held on Thursday afternoon to remember the Chinese victims of the recent Karachi University attack.

The event was attended among others by Pakistani federal ministers Shazia Marri and Khurram Dastgir Khan.

The Pakistani ministers vowed to punish the perpetrators of the attack that also killed a Pakistani national.

“Attended memorial service of the victims of terrorist that took precious lives of Chinese nationals Mr Huang Guiping, Ms Ding Mufang, Ms Chen Sai and driver Khalid Nawaz,” Shazia Marri, the minister for poverty alleviation, later tweeted.

She added: “Pakistan and China have always stood together in challenging times and will continue this tradition of mutual respect.”

Minister for Power Khurram Dastgir Khan said the perpetrators of the Karachi University (KU) terror attack would be punished.

Addressing the event, he expressed his deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and the government and the people of China. The minister said Pakistan condemned terrorism in its all forms.

On April 26, at least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi Confucius Institute.

The incident happened as a van, carrying staff members, was about to enter the Confucius Institute, located next to the commerce department.

Television footage showed a white van in flames with plumes of smoke rising from its remains. The windows of nearby buildings were also seen shattered from the impact of the explosion.

CCTV footage of the attack showed a burqa (veil)-clad woman standing outside the entrance of the Confucius Institute. The woman detonated herself just as the van neared the institute’s entrance. The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.",Q2

https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/byu-student-flaunts-rainbow-pride-colors-during-graduation,BYU student flaunts rainbow pride colors during graduation,"PROVO, Utah — A gay BYU student shocked a packed graduation ceremony Friday by flashing rainbow pride colors while accepting her diploma.

As Jillian Orr walked across the stage at the Marriott Center on Friday, she opened her gown to show the colors stitched inside. She said she made the gesture to protest the school's policy which essentially bans same-sex relationships.

""I wanted to give the message to other students that I made it through and that they can make it through,"" said Orr.

While saying she had positive experiences at the school during her time in Provo, she said there were many moments when she felt increasingly uncomfortable.

""There were situations where teachers or courses or information that was shared that made it very clear and very evident that we were not to be seen. And that we were not as equal as those who were heterosexual,"" shared Orr.

As her final semester wound down this spring, Orr said certain experiences in the classroom started to become painful; claiming there were quizzes on how to interact with the LGBTQ community that she didn't agree with and having to write papers on how marriage was only between a man and a woman.

""Once I started getting through these classes and through these experiences, I had this feeling that, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm finally escaping,' like I'm finally getting out and I can be authentic,"" Orr said.

BYU graduate Jillian Orr explains below what led her to wearing pride colors in her graduation gown

BYU student flaunts rainbow pride colors during graduation

During her time at BYU, Orr was aware of the risks of being caught in a same-sex relationship.

""It was always scary,"" said Orr.

It was ahead of last week's graduation when Orr decided she should make a statement.

""I wanted to give the message to other students that I made it through and that they can make it through,"" Orr said.

It was Orr's sister who first suggested she wear a rainbow dress under the gown, but Orr said that wasn't her ""energy."" Her sister then came up with putting the colors on the liner, which her other sister quickly sewed the day before the ceremony.

As the hours clicked down until the big moment arrived, an anxious Orr wondered what kind of response she would receive from school officials.

""Are they going to tackle me? Am I going to be taken down? What's going to happen?,"" asked Orr.

Before Orr took the stage, she said her sisters texted, saying that if she didn't go through with the ""flash"" they would understand and still loved her. But Orr said she was determined not to back down.

""I did this knowing I could lose my degree, because I wanted to be seen and wanted those who are going through what I went through to be seen as well.""

After first getting in the wrong line and almost getting lost, Orr finally made it to the stage and flashed open her gown, showing off the colors of the rainbow to all in attendance.

""I don't remember what happened after that! I just blanked!"" exclaimed Orr.

She said she instantly received support from the students around her, including one who stopped her to say their girlfriend had seen the moment on live television and wanted to say thank you.

""I was like, it's already impacted somebody. Somebody has already been seen and felt seen because of what I did,"" Orr said.

Orr says that no one with the school has contacted her after her ""flash,"" and that it wouldn't matter as she already has her degree certificate.",Q2

Leniz Escobar, 22, was found guilty of each of her six charges after just 16 minutes of juror deliberation deliberation on Monday.

She faces life behind bars at her sentencing later this year.

Escobar stared blankly and stiff-shouldered as the verdict was read.

She was accused of drawing the young men to a local park after lying to the MS-13 members, saying that they had 'mocked' the notorious gangsters, prosecutor Justina Geraci said during closing arguments in the trial, which wrapped up last week in Central Islip, New York.

In a video of a jailhouse call released last Thursday Escobar said that she 'was really happy' with what she'd done.

The conversation, played during Escobar's trial Thursday and obtained by the New York Post, was released just before the jury began their deliberations.

Escobar tells boyfriend Jeffrey Amador she 'f--ked up' because one of the five young men - Elmer Alexander Arteaga Ruiz, who testified at the trial - escaped.

Amador then angrily asked: 'So, why the f–k do you have to get involved in that s–t?' What you'd get out of all this?'

'Nothing,' Escobar replied. 'I was gonna be happy. Because I was really happy. I'm telling you straight out, I was happy for this to happen.'

'Yeah,' Amador said. 'I know that you get excited with stuff like that, with crazy stuff, you know?'

'Yeah,' Escobar answered. 'I was happy for that to happen.'

A family friend of Escobar gave an emotional statement in Spanish to reporters outside the court house on Monday

This comes after Geraci detailed the joy Escobar seemed to take in the death of Michael Lopez, 20, and three friends - Justin Llivicura, 16, Jorge Tigre, 18, and Jefferson Villalobos, 18 - all executed by the notorious gang.

'You heard [MS-13 gang member] David Gaitan-Rivera's testimony,' Geraci told the jury of the 2017 slayings. 'He told you how one of the victims had reached for [Escobar] before he was killed and his blood had gotten all over her shirt. He told you how she licked her lips.'

Keyli Gomez, a friend of Diablita, testified earlier in the week that she and Escobar 'crouched down by the victims and watched as they were killed. Not screaming or crying while the victims were macheted to death.'

Geraci also said Escobar - whose boyfriend was a high ranking member of the gang - smiled as Lopez, 20, was hacked to death.

While prosecutors were outlining their case one last time for the jury, Escobar was seen smiling and joking with her legal team, wearing her hair in a ponytail and chrome piercings on her cheeks.

Escobar is said to have snitched on the teens for claiming to have been MS-13 gang members on social media, with its real members deciding to execute them for it -deeming the social media boasting a show of disrespect.

They were also accused by the gang of being members of the rival 18th Street Gang.

One of the intended victims, Elmer Alexander Arteaga Ruiz, made it out alive by running for his life. He testified against Escobar at trial.

They allege that Escobar and Gomez brought them to a park to smoke marijuana as the gangsters waited to kill them.

Recalling the moment his friends were hacked to death, Ruiz told the court: 'They came through a hole in the fence.

'There were eight or nine. They covered their faces with sweaters. They came and formed a semi-circle. They told us get down on our knees.

'They said, 'Don't move. Whoever moves, dies.

'I ran because the first words they said was that we were going to die, they were going to kill us, and they had weapons...

'I took off running and there were two people who started to follow me,' he said. 'Thank God I managed to escape.'

Ruiz said he and his friends had made the MS-13 posts in a bid to impress women and that he and his young pals were 'just high school kids who were trying to look tough.'

'[Ruiz] was a poser and that's why he was marked for death,' Geraci said of Ruiz. 'He thought this stuff would attract girls and it did - but not in the way he had hoped.'

Escobar's boyfriend, an MS-13 member, testified saying the gang was being overrun by kids and had no balls.

Prosecutors say Escobar was 17 years old in April 2017, when she helped orchestrate the massacre as an associate of the notoriously ruthless gang before falsely claiming to be a victim in the ambush.

MS-13 had been seeking to settle a score, prosecutors allege, and believed the young victims - - to be members of the rival 18th Street Gang. The victims' families have denied that any of the slain men were in a gang.

Diablita's attorneys have argued that she did not know the victims would be in any way attacked and that she was not a member or associate of the gang.

Feared gang is behind thousands of US murders MS-13 is a transnational gang that has committed horrendous acts of violence across America. The gang's motto is 'mata, viola, controla' which means 'kill, rape, control'. There are more than 10,000 MS-13 members in the US and more than 30,000 worldwide. MS-13 leaders in the US often communicate and take orders from gang leaders in El Salvador. Long Island communities have been strongly impacted by the violence and suffering spread by MS-13. Police suspect the gang was involved in at least 25 killings on Long Island between 2016 and 2018. Advertisement

'Not every girlfriend is an associate,' defense attorney Jesse Siegel said. 'Her boyfriend was a homeboy. She was there. She certainly didn't prevent it from happening. The issue is if she knew something was going to happen.'

At one point Siegel accidentally said 'you should find her guilty' before correcting himself.

During opening statements on March 21st, Assistant US Attorney Megan Farrell said that the victims were 'just high school kids' whose only crime was flashing MS-13 gang signs on social media to 'look tough and get attention,' reported New York Post.

Their macho posturing, however, was interpreted by the MS-13 cohorts as a sign of disrespect punishable by death.

According to prosecutors, Escobar, known then by the moniker 'Diabalita,' or 'Little Devil,' was seeking to curry favor with MS-13 and alerted its members to the victims' location in a wooden area.

Farrell described Escobar as a 'devoted associate' of the gang, where her boyfriend was a high-ranking member.

On April 11, 2017, the four victims founded themselves in a Central Islip park, surrounded by more than a dozen MS-13 gang members brandishing machetes, knives and tree limbs.

Farrell told the jury that the killers ordered the five high schoolers to get down on the ground.

'The defendant pretended to be one of the victims and got down. The real victims took off running, but [Artega Ruiz] was the only one fast enough to escape. The other four were hacked to death,' the prosecutor said, describing the victims' terrified screams filling the night air.

Under MS-13 rules, the killings had been 'pre-authorized' by gang leadership, prosecutors said, and contributors to the carnage stood to gain membership or ascend the organization's ranks.

Farrell said that a day after the slaughter, Escobar 'bragged about her important role in the murders' and told her boyfriend that 'she did it to be happy and was happy it happened.'

Authorities said Escobar later tossed her cellphone from a moving vehicle — as well as a SIM card that had been removed and damaged so badly law enforcement couldn't recover its contents.

The mutilated bodies of the victims were discovered on April 13, 2017, in a Central Islip park. They were slaughtered with machetes, knives and tree limbs

'Additionally, Escobar discarded the bloody clothing that she had been wearing on the night of the murders,' prosecutors wrote in a court filing.

In his opening statement, Escobar's defense attorney, Keith White, attempted to distance his client from the attackers and argued that she did not know that the victims would be killed.

On Day 1 of the trial the jury also heard testimony from Nassau County Detective Donal Britton, who described the gruesome scene that officers came upon in the park after the killings.

'They were lying on top of each other,' he said of the victims. 'There was a lot of blood.'",Q2

https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/osama-bin-laden-planned-two-181935444.html,"Osama bin Laden planned two terror attacks against the US following 9/11, report says","A trove of documents belonging to Osama bin Laden have revealed that the terrorist was planning a second attack against the US just three years after 9/11.

In May 2011, Navy SEALs killed bin Laden at his home in Abbottabad, Pakistan, during Operation Neptune Spear. During the raid, the SEALs discovered the home was filled with bin Laden's correspondence with other al-Qaeda members. They collected as much evidence as they could carry before fleeing the home.

Dr Nelly Lahoud was tapped by West Point's Combatting Terrorism Centre to analyse bin Laden's letters after they were declassified in 2012. It was her work that revealed bin Laden's plans in 2004.

After bin Laden spent three years incommunicado in the wake of 9/11 – a necessary silence he maintained while fleeing US troops – the terrorist leader reconnected with surviving al-Qaeda members and began planning his next attack.

CBS News spoke with Dr Lahoud, who explained bin Laden's proposed attack.

According to the letter, bin Laden suggested the next attack be similar to the September 11th attacks, but that plan would have seen operatives chartering the planes rather than hijacking commercial airliners.

He also reasoned that if obtaining airplanes became too difficult, al Qaeda could switch focus to the US rail system.

Dr Lahoud explained how bin Laden was involved in the granular planning of the attack, even utilising his engineering background to devise methods for causing destruction.

""He wanted to have 12 metres of steel rail removed so that, this way, the train could be derailed. And we find him, explaining the simple toolkit that they could use. You know, he said, 'You're-- you could use a compressor. You could use a smelting iron tool,'"" she said.

At the time al-Qaeda's resources had been decimated by the war in Afghanistan, thankfully preventing the organisation from carrying out the attack.

She said that bin Laden was not aware of the state of al-Qaeda at the time, and insinuated that some of his close confidants had been lying to him about its strength. She said one individual he corresponded with finally told him the truth in one of the letters.

By 2006, al-Qaeda only had $200,000 in its coffers and was losing control of its organisation.

Despite this, bin Laden reportedly continued to dream up attacks. In one, he suggested al-Qaeda members buy small wooden fishing boats in the US and essentially go undercover as fishermen near the nation's port cities. He wanted them to blow the ships up and sink oil tankers in an effort to harm the US economy.

That plan was eventually thwarted due to the Arab Spring. Bin Laden and the rest of the leadership in al-Qaeda were reportedly concerned and confused by the protests around the Arab world.",Q2

MAGNA — An arrest warrant has been issued for man in connection with a murder investigation in Magna that may have been sparked by gang rivalry.

Noah Ezequiel Valenzuela Sanchez, 22, was charged Monday in 3rd District Court with murder, a first-degree felony; obstruction of justice, a second-degree felony; and 12 counts of illegally shooting a gun, a third-degree felony.

On April 8, Unified police were called to 2617 S. Ponsonby Street (7250 West) on a report of a shooting.

""The caller reported that two men were in a physical altercation and one of the males pulled out a gun and started shooting at the man in the other vehicle,"" according to charging documents.

When officers arrived, Fernando Ruesga, 20, of Magna, was found deceased inside a Dodge Charger with a gunshot wound to his head, the charges state. Thirteen shell casings were found close to the car.

Witness told detectives that Sanchez and Ruesga had gotten into a fight before separating and each going to his own car. As Ruesga began to drive away, Sanchez pulled out a gun and fired at him 13 times, the charges allege.

A woman, who prosecutors say has two children with Ruesga but is Sanchez's girlfriend, told police that the two men ""had a beef with each other due to their gang affiliation,"" according to the charges.

Police say Sanchez drove off in a Maserati after the shooting. The car was found abandoned in an apartment complex in Salt Lake City on April 12. A witness told police that after Sanchez ditched the car in the parking lot, then got into a silver SUV and drove off.

Using cellphone data and at least one eyewitness, Salt Lake police said they identified Sanchez as the gunman.

""The defendant and his vehicle were placed at the scene of the homicide. An eyewitness identified the defendant as the shooter, and data from T-Mobile and the defendant's vehicle also places him at the scene at the time of the shooting,"" according to the charges. ""Despite numerous efforts, law enforcement has been unable to locate (him) and it is believed that he has left the state.""",Q2

AUGUSTA, Maine — In October 2019, Melissa Sousa was reported missing after not showing up to work.

Police said she was last seen that morning, bringing her 8-year-old twin daughters to the bus stop. When police went to the home she shared with Nicholas Lovejoy, he wouldn't allow them in and told them Sousa had left.

Hours later, in the middle of the night, officers who were staked out around the corner saw Lovejoy drive off, leaving the girls alone in the apartment.

They stopped him for a broken light over his license plate, found a loaded rifle in the car, and took him into custody. It was when they searched the house after the traffic stop that they found Melissa Sousa's body under a tarp in the basement. Lovejoy was charged with killing her.

Lovejoy's lawyers asked a judge Friday to exclude evidence gained in that search. His attorneys argue that the evidence obtained should be stricken because the officers didn't have a warrant to go inside the apartment at that time.

""If the court determines some of these issues in our favor, [it] potentially could mean the end of the case,"" Derrick Banda, who represents Lovejoy, said.

State prosecutors declined to speak after the hearing but argued in court that the twins were believed to be left alone in the middle of the night, which was reason enough for police to enter.

""Yes, there was no information that they were in danger, but there also wasn't any information that they weren't,"" a state prosecutor said.

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/ballot-box-paranoia,Ballot box paranoia,"You wouldn’t know it from social media, but most Americans believe that Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election and Joe Biden won in 2020. They are correct: There has not been a stolen presidential election in America in living memory. Our electoral system is not perfect, but it works. Instead of decrying the whole edifice as fraudulent, people in positions of authority should work to fix those flaws that remain and build up trust in this most important of democratic institutions.

Disappointed partisans try their best to pretend that the system is deeply flawed. In February 2021, shortly after Joe Biden’s inauguration, one-third of respondents told AP-NORC pollsters that they did not believe Biden was “legitimately elected” to the White House. Perhaps that is not all that surprising: Shortly after Trump’s election in 2016, more than one-sixth said that his election was illegitimate, too, according to Gallup.

Sadly, this is nothing new. In July 2001, 18% said that George W. Bush had “stolen” the election the year before, and 33% said he had “won on a technicality.” In 2009, 26% of voters told the left-leaning Public Policy Polling that ACORN had stolen the election for Barack Obama.

Crying foul on elections is not an especially modern phenomenon. Andrew Jackson’s supporters invented the idea of a popular vote in 1824, when their candidate won a plurality of votes in both the electoral and popular contests but still lost the contingent election in the House of Representatives. Jacksonians complained about the “corrupt bargain” for the next four years. After Rutherford Hayes beat Samuel Tilden in 1876, Democrats called the president “Rutherfraud” (the 19th-century version of “Drumpf”) and launched tedious investigations in Congress that revealed more fraud from their side than from Republicans.

The partisans of 1876 hit upon probably the most clearly fraudulent election in our history, one that came at the tail end of the most politically divisive era since the Revolution. But even then, as congressional investigations showed, the cheating in Southern elections was so rampant on both sides that it was impossible to say which candidate had fairly won. Democrats used the domestic terror of the Ku Klux Klan to keep black men away from the polls, while Republicans used the machinery of government to make up for that with some “creative” vote-counting.

It was not a fair election in the South, and partisans on both sides were justly aggrieved. The growing disenfranchisement of black Southerners that followed 1876 calls into doubt any electoral result in which the Democrat depended on the “solid South” to win the White House, including Woodrow Wilson’s narrow reelection victory in 1916. But it has been a long time since those conditions prevailed in the South or anywhere else in America. Our modern complaints about voter access or voter fraud are marginal compared to the level of chicanery and outright violence that used to sway national elections.

Richard Hofstadter famously called our penchant for conspiracy “the paranoid style in American politics” and tried to paint it as a right-wing phenomenon. But like many species of political madness, it is a bipartisan malady, brought on by the unbearable agony of having lost an election. Left and Right, populist and establishment: Each has a contingent of enthusiastic partisans who find it all too easy to believe that the only way their views could be rejected by the electorate is through fraud.

A lot of this is sour grapes, the sort of thing that has been around forever in politics. It calls to mind a children’s whiffle ball game, in which the only two outcomes any child claims are “we won” or “they cheated.” When restricted to those irreconcilable party loyalists, such complaints are tolerable. A solid liberal democracy can withstand the insults of a marginal few.

Now, though, we have the last two elections’ losers going around the country claiming they were cheated. Hillary Clinton has maintained this fiction since the moment she lost, repeating often what she said in a memorable 2019 speech, that “you can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.” Trump went beyond this, telling supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, that they had just seen “the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world,” and that “if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” In this, Clinton and Trump are two sides of the same coin.

That cynical approach to electoral loss might soothe these candidates’ egos, but it does the country a disservice. When only online extremists are imagining conspiracies, normal people will ignore it. When the candidates themselves cry out that there was large-scale fraud, it makes it more believable and acceptable to the average voter. In this, Clinton and Trump have done what Al Gore, John Kerry, John McCain, and Mitt Romney knew was wrong: degrading trust in the American electoral system rather than admitting that they lost.

Admitting defeat was just one part of what makes the American voting system work. Since the Civil War, widespread use of secret ballots made people trust a system that used to be dominated by overt partisan pressures. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 made sure that everyone had the right to such a ballot, regardless of race. These were important steps toward realizing the vision of a government being fairly chosen by the people. Compared to where we began, America has made tremendous strides, and the voters are right to trust in the system.

This is borne out time and again when anyone takes the trouble to look into claims of fraud or corruption in the system. Georgia’s voting laws are an example of both sides exaggerating the problems instead of fixing those that do exist. Democratic activists have decried Georgia’s voter roll purges for years, calling them racist and disenfranchising. But when the Atlanta Journal-Constitution actually investigated the matter in 2020, it found that nearly all removals were entirely routine — most often because the voter moved out of the jurisdiction. Far from being racist, the investigation found that whites were slightly more likely than black voters to have their names removed from the rolls.

In the 2020 election, Georgia’s voting system also came under attack from the Right, with accusations of outright fraud in the counting of presidential ballots there. But again, an investigation found little evidence of such a conspiracy, with the hand recount being almost exactly the same as the machine count, and nowhere near enough to affect Joe Biden’s 12,000-vote victory there. After counting over 525,000 paper ballots from Fulton County, the total shifted (in favor of Trump) by 345 votes. Even this disparity is too high, but it appeared, according to investigators, to be more human error than deliberate ploy.

There is a wide swath of the electorate that would be open to minor changes to make the vote both more secure and more accessible. Americans, by and large, take voter fraud seriously, and they oppose making voting too onerous. But as Biden calls resistance to his voting law plans “Jim Crow on steroids,” Trump insists that his victory was stolen by big-city Democratic machines, and Clinton rambles on about Russian collusion, all of the room for bipartisan reform is squeezed out by hyperpartisan tribalism.

What should responsible government leaders do instead? Requiring identification to vote is a broadly popular position. According to a Monmouth University poll last year, 80% support the idea, including 62% of Democrats. That’s unsurprising: Americans need to show ID all the time for transactions of far less importance. Elected Democrats pretend this would reimpose the worst of Jim Crow, but Democratic voters mostly think it is a good idea — as do independents and Republicans.

The same poll found that most voters think getting to the polls on Election Day should be made easier. While just 50% thought mail-in voting should be expanded, 71% said in-person voting should be made easier. Again, that makes sense — most voters can see that the safeguards around the secret ballot are much stronger in an in-person polling place. They don’t want to weaken those safeguards, just expand access to them.

All of this has the makings of a fair compromise that many state legislatures could endorse. Expand in-person early voting, tighten up the safeguards on mail voting, and require a government-issued ID to cast a ballot. These are common-sense recommendations that would increase access and security at the ballot box.

Instead, we have national leaders pretending that our voting system is as fraudulent as that of Russia, if not North Korea. It’s a cynical ploy to rile up the base and do some fundraising along the way. But what seems like a no-cost way to rally support is turning out to be more corrosive to faith in our electoral system than anything we have seen in a long time.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision Friday to overturn the 50-year landmark Roe vs Wade decision that made abortion legal was met with stunned disbelief and dashed hopes it would not happen.

Meanwhile, anti-abortion activists said their prayers have been answered.

As reality set in, present and past leaders of Planned Parenthood clinics in Southwest Florida and women’s rights organizations throughout the state vowed to keep fighting to protect women.

“By overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has now officially given politicians across the country the power to control what people can do with their own bodies,” Stephanie Fraim, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida, said in a statement.

Previous coverage:Doctors say abortion ban at 15 weeks in Florida is 'bad medicine and bad policy'

In October:'Women's rights are human rights': Hundreds gather for women's march in Fort Myers and Naples

“This means millions of Americans will no longer be trusted to determine the course of their own lives.”

Fraim said “this dangerous and chilling decision” will have devastating consequences and will force people who can afford it to travel hundreds of miles or more for abortion care in Florida and other states where at least some access is still protected.

“This ruling eliminates the federal constitutional right to privacy around abortion, but the Florida state constitution still protects that right,” Fraim said. “The Florida 15-week abortion ban, which will go into effect July 1st, is clearly unconstitutional, which is why Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida and other plaintiffs are suing to stop it.”

She added: “We will not sit idly by while our freedoms are stripped away like this, we will not stop fighting for our rights.”

In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis in mid-April signed into law a 15-week abortion ban that dramatically reduces the window for women to get an abortion from the current law of 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The new Florida law does not provide an exception for rape, incest, human trafficking or mental health.

The only exceptions to the new Florida law is when the mother is at risk of death, ""irreversible physical impairment"" or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.

Char Wendel fears what could come next. She is the former president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Collier County, serving for 18 years, before the merger with the Southwest Florida and Central Florida affiliates.

“This is not only about abortion this is about controlling women,” Wendel said. ""I am devastated that the court has decided that women cannot make a choice about how to live their lives. Prohibitions on birth control will be next.”

Abortions were halted at the Naples location at 1425 Creech Road during the COVID-19 pandemic and have yet to restart.

Protests against abortion in Southwest Florida

Under Wendel’s helm, the clinic in Naples began abortions in 2009 when there was no other provider in Collier offering the procedures.

Abortion opponents regularly protested and the staff began offering escorts with umbrellas for women coming to the clinic to protect their privacy. There were incidents of after-hours vandalism and a bomb threat.

Wendel turned the animosity into an opportunity and raised $23,000 to beef up security after part of the front doors were cemented closed in late April 2009.

The Creech Road center always had video cameras outside but after that incident, closed circuit televisions, security officers and extra lighting was added.

In January, several people who were protesting abortion outside of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Fort Myers and blocked the entrance were arrested.

An estimated 35 to 50 protesters were present, and some yelled insults to clinic employees.

Dr. Paul Kardon, a retired obstetrician/gynecologist in Naples who served as president of the board of Planned Parenthood in Collier when abortions began at the Naples clinic, said the Supreme Court’s decision is a grave mistake.

“The country at large is not in favor of it,” he said. “There is a lot of mixing religion and government. This is a giant step backward.”

When he was practicing in New York when abortion became legal in that state in 1971, two years before Roe in 1973, he remembers doing abortions safely and how different it was from earlier when women were getting unsafe abortions.

How many abortions are done in Florida?

For abortion opponents, the decision is embraced and Andrew Shirvell, founder and executive director of Florida Voices for the Unborn, gave “thanks to the Lord” for the decision.

He renewed his request that he made in May, when a draft of the decision was leaked, for DeSantis to call for an immediate special session to consider a complete statutory ban on all abortions in Florida.

“Governor DeSantis and the Legislature cannot continue to be held hostage by what our state courts may or may not do,” he said.

In Florida last year, nearly 80,000 abortions were performed, according to data from the state Agency for Health Care Administration.

The data shows more than 59,000 abortions were listed as elective, for 74% of the total, while nearly 17,000 abortions were done for social or economic reasons and 1,500 were done for the psychological health of the mother.

Father Michael Orsi, with St. Agnes Catholic Church in North Naples, said he was delighted by the court’s action. Orsi has taken part in peaceful protests with other abortion opponents outside of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Naples for years.

“Almost 50 years of prayer and perseverance and finally the court has corrected a terrible, terrible decision,” Orsi said. “It just shows if people are persistent and pray the right thing would be done.”

Going forward the message to Christians is be peaceful if they attend protests organized by abortion rights supporters, he said.

“What we tell Christians to do is peacefully and prayerfully give thanks to God,” he said. “Anytime we talk to Christians (we say) violence can never be part of the equation.”

B.C. Cloutier, president of Action for Life, an anti-abortion organization serving Lee, Collier, Glades and Hendry counties, said the decision was anticipated, especially in light of the leak of the draft decision in May.

“It will save thousands of babies but it won’t stop abortion here or anywhere else,” he said. “It puts the decision in the hands of the people via their elected officials, and that is where the decision should have been.”

Action for Life’s focus, which has 3,000 supporters in Southwest Florida, is to educate people about alternatives to abortion and the court’s decision may bring more attention to adoption, he said.

“I think it is a great alternative,” Cloutier said. “We just launched an initiative to engage young people more fully to try to practice abstinence.”

Scott Baier, chief executive officer of Community Pregnancy Clinics, which has locations in Naples, Fort Myers, Sarasota and Gainesville, said the mission of helping women and families with a crisis pregnancy will increase.

He also called for abortion supporters to end violence toward organizations like his since the draft decision of the court was leaked in May.

“Many of the pregnancy centers have been vandalized, and others have even been bombed,” he said. “We call for peace and we continue to protect the well-being and safety of our clients and staff. Regardless of the circumstances, CPCI and the thousands of other pregnancy resource centers across the country, will be there to continue helping women and families in crisis.”

Physicians fear for women, families

Dr. Kristen Witkowski, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Tampa, who was vocal earlier this year when Florida lawmakers were debating the 15-week ban and the outfall to women with fetal abnormalities, said Friday, ""I feel sick to my stomach but unfortunately I am not surprised.""

“For those who think this is a victory for life and for families, it isn't,” she said. “More pregnant women will die and more families will be living in poverty.”

For people who think this just the federal government staying out of it, ""it is not,"" she said. “The government ‘staying out of it’ would be leaving the medical decision making up to patients and their doctors, just like in every other aspect of healthcare.”

Witkowski said anti-abortion legislators will need to work on supporting the families that they claim to care so deeply about.

“I hope men are just as outraged as women and willing to play their part in preventing pregnancy,” she said.” I hope everyone takes their state elections seriously and votes for representatives who will protect women.”

A Woman’s Choice practice with locations in Jacksonville in Florida and in North Carolina in of Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, said the decision disregards that most Americans want access to safe, legal abortion and protections for this extremely personal healthcare decision.

""Today’s decision to overturn 50 years of settled law is a betrayal by the Supreme Court of the United States. A betrayal of pregnant people and their families, liberty, and decency,” Kelly Flynn, president and chief executive officer of A Women’s Choice, said in a statement.

“Abortion is healthcare and today’s decision will not stop people from needing abortions, but it will make it more difficult, sometimes impossible, for people to get the care they need,” Flynn said.

Flynn added that the practice’s mission “will not change in light of this horrific betrayal.”

“We will still provide safe, nonjudgmental, affordable abortions and vow to work tirelessly to ensure that the right to abortion everywhere is restored,” she said.",Q2

https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/may/28/supreme-court-sheldon-whitehouse-ethics-reform,"Congress ‘absolutely’ can impose ethics reform on supreme court, senator says","Congress “absolutely” can force ethics reform on the US supreme court, a senior Democratic senator said, countering arguments made by Harlan Crow, the Republican mega-donor whose gifts to the conservative justice Clarence Thomas are the source of scandal, and by John Roberts, the chief justice himself.

“It is not going to be easy,” Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told NBC’s Meet the Press in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday. “The work that we’re doing on ethics in the court ought to be easy. And yet it’s not. It’s partisan also.

“So I think that the first step is going to be for the judicial conference, the other judges, to put some constraints around the supreme court’s behavior and treat the supreme court the way all other federal judges are treated.”

Supreme court justices are nominally subject to federal ethics laws but in practice govern themselves.

Thomas has said he did not declare gifts from Crow including luxury travel and resort stays, a property purchase involving his mother and school fees for a great-nephew because he was informally advised he did not have to. He has said he will do so in future.

Observers have said Thomas clearly broke ethics laws. Democrats have called for Thomas to resign or be impeached, the former unlikely, the latter a political non-starter.

Crow denies wrongdoing and claims never to have discussed with Thomas politics or business before the court. The Guardian has shown Crow to have had business before the court during his friendship with Thomas.

Crow has also donated to groups linked to Ginni Thomas, the justice’s far-right activist wife who supported Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.

Whitehouse’s NBC host, Chuck Todd, said: “It’s pretty established Congress can’t [impose ethics law on the supreme court], right?”

The senator said: “No, it absolutely can.”

Todd said: “Well, it doesn’t mean it’s constitutional.”

Whitehouse said: “Yes, it does. It means it’s constitutional because the laws that we’re talking about right now are actually laws passed by Congress. The ethics reporting law that is at the heart of the Clarence Thomas ethics reporting scandal is a law passed by Congress.”

Todd repeated the argument about separation of powers, between the legislature (Congress), executive (presidency) and judiciary, which lawyers for Crow and Roberts himself have cited in refusing to cooperate with information requests from the Democratic-run Senate judiciary and finance committees.

Whitehouse, a member of both panels, countered: “Certainly we can do the administrative side of judicial … I’ll be the first one to concede, if there’s a case in the judicial branch of government, we in the Congress have nothing to say about it.

“But in terms of administering how the internal ethics of the judicial branch are done – heck, the judicial conference which does that is a creation of Congress.”

The senator also called the Roberts court a “fact-free zone as well as an ethics-free zone”.

Referring to suggestions justices should pledge to observe ethics laws during the confirmation process, Whitehouse said: “We saw how the pledges on Roe v Wade went in the confirmation process.”

Roe, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion, was last year struck down by a 5-4 majority, all three justices appointed by Donald Trump (Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett) voting in the majority.

In the words of Factcheck.org: “A close examination of the carefully worded answers by the three Trump appointees … shows that while each acknowledged at their hearings that Roe was precedent, and should be afforded the weight that that carries, none specifically committed to refusing to consider overturning it.”

Whitehouse continued: “You get on to the court, and there you are, and there’s no process for determining what the facts are. That’s part of the problem here.

“When Justice Thomas failed to recuse himself from the January 6 investigation that turned up his wife’s communications [with Trump officials], he made the case that that was OK because he had no idea that she was involved in insurrection activities.

“That is a question of fact. That’s something that could have, and should have, been determined by a neutral examination. And so the problem with the supreme court is that they’re in a fact-free zone as well as an ethics-free zone.”

Whitehouse has campaigned against so-called “dark money” in US politics. Asked if he trusted the federal court system to be fair and impartial, he said: “Usually, I think the trial courts are very strong.

“I think … we’ve seen honest courtrooms make amazing differences with Dominion v Fox, with the parents at Sandy Hook against the creep who was pretending that their children’s murder wasn’t real, and now with the judgment against Donald Trump.

“So honest courtrooms are really important to cut through to the truth. When you get to the supreme court, if it’s an interest in which the big rightwing billionaires are concerned, [it’s] very hard to count on getting a fair shot.”

Many of her dreams came true, but they ended abruptly and violently when she was brutally beaten by her boyfriend, a lawyer for Love’s family told a jury Tuesday in the civil trial of the man convicted in her killing.

George Huguely V was convicted of second-degree murder and is serving a 23-year prison sentence in Love’s slaying. Yeardley, a Cockeysville resident who attended Notre Dame Prep, and Huguely, who lived in Chevy Chase and attended Landon, both played lacrosse at Virginia and were weeks away from graduation when Yeardley was found dead in her off-campus apartment in 2010.

A wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Love’s mother, Sharon Love, seeks to hold him civilly liable for her daughter’s death. The lawsuit is seeking $29.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages.

As the civil trial got underway, Paul Bekman, a lawyer for Love’s family, showed the jury happy photos of Love with her mother and sister. He described a kind, thoughtful and caring young woman who played lacrosse, joined a sorority and kept up with a rigorous academic schedule at Virginia while making sure to speak with her family almost every day.

Bekman told the jury that Love and Huguely had dated for two years, but had a “rocky relationship” that was marred by Huguely’s excessive drinking. He said fellow students will testify about earlier violent episodes when Huguely was drunk, including one that happened about a month or two before Yeardley was killed, when visiting lacrosse players from North Carolina heard Love yell, “Help, I can’t breathe,” and walked in to Huguely’s bedroom to find Huguely with his “hands around her neck.”

Bekman showed the jury graphic crime scene photos of Love as she lay dead on her bedroom floor, with her right eye bashed in, her face bloody, and marks on her shoulder and neck. Love’s mother and sister left the courtroom just before the photos were shown and cried softly during other portions of the opening statements.

A medical examiner determined that Love died from blunt-force injuries to her head.

“She died as a result of a vicious and brutal beating,” Bekman said.

Huguely’s attorney, Matthew Green, told jurors that Huguely admits he assaulted Love and that her family is entitled to compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the jury. But he said the defense will argue that Huguely’s actions did not amount to the “willful and wanton” conduct that is required to award punitive damages. In fact, Green said, Huguely did not intend to cause Love’s death.

Green urged the jury to focus on the approximately eight to 10 minutes Huguely spent in Love’s apartment the night she was killed. He said Huguely was a “party animal” who began drinking right after the men’s lacrosse team played its final game May 1, 2010. Huguely’s family was in town for senior day, and he spent the next 30 hours consuming 45 to 50 drinks, using a “conservative estimate,” Green said.

The following day, Love and Huguely exchanged angry, “immature emails,” but had patched things up by that night and were seen on video holding hands as they spent time with Huguely’s family at a bar, Green said. Then, about 11:45 p.m., a drunken Huguely went to Love’s apartment, where he kicked in her bedroom door.

During questioning by police early the next morning, Huguely said he only went to Love’s apartment to talk to her, but their argument quickly turned physical. Huguely said Love’s head hit the wall and they wrestled on the floor, but that when he left, she only had a bloody nose. Her roommates found her dead about two hours later.

Green said Love’s visible injuries were limited to the right side of her face, which he said is “consistent with a single impact, some kind of a fall where her face impacts the floor.”

Green said that when police told Huguely that Love was dead, his videotaped interview shows that “he just doesn’t believe it.”

“It’s clear he had no understanding a fatal event had happened,” Green said.

Green said the jury in Huguely’s criminal trial rejected a first-degree murder charge and instead found him guilty of second-degree murder. He is about halfway through his 23-year prison sentence.

“Justice has been done,” Green said.

The lawsuit was initially filed in 2012, but was later voluntarily dismissed and then refiled in 2018.",Q2

https://www.katc.com/news/abortion-rights-advocates-hit-the-streets-for-the-lafayette-bans-off-our-body-march,Abortion rights advocates hit the streets for the Lafayette Bans Off Our Bodies march,"Abortion rights advocates took to the streets of Downtown Lafayette to protest the Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, effectively ending abortions here in Louisiana.

Louisiana was one of thirteen states that immediately banned all forms of abortion, with no exceptions for rape or incest, once Roe v. Wade was overturned due to the state's Trigger Laws.

Senate Bill 342, drafted by democratic state Sen. Katrina Jackson, passed legislation a few weeks ago and was later signed by Gov. John Bell Edwards, who is also a democrat.

The bill bans all forms of abortion from the ""moment of fertilization"". It also lays out penalties for those who perform abortions, including fines and jail time.

The only exceptions included in the bill are for pregnancies which pose a substantial risk of death or physical harm if carried through.

But pro-choice advocates here in Lafayette are not backing down. Many came out Sunday morning to march the streets in protest of the decision, which some say is only the beginning of an erasure of fundamental rights.

Demonstrators brought signs and costumes voicing their rage over the decision to overturn the 1973 ruling.

Lafayette is not alone in the march for abortion rights. Across the nation, citizens are filling the streets in protest against the Supreme Court decision.

CNN, CNNBUSINESS

By Catherine Thorbecke, CNN Business

Airbnb on Wednesday announced new ways to search for and book homes on the platform in response to the rise of remote work and the number of customers choosing longer stays.

The new features include the ability to more easily divide trips between two homes when options for longer stays are limited and a search tool that surfaces properties via specific categories, such as whether the house offers “creative spaces,” a chef’s kitchen or a pool. The features were unveiled at a company keynote event ahead of the all-important summer travel season.

“The way people travel has changed forever,” Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s cofounder and CEO, said in a statement ahead of the event. Chesky touted the new features as “the biggest change to Airbnb in a decade.”

The updates come as Airbnb recently reported business was booming again after being clobbered by the pandemic’s hit to the travel industry. In its most recent earnings report, Airbnb posted quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion, up 70% from the same period last year.

The company said nearly half of the nights booked on Airbnb in the last three months were for trips of a week or longer. Chesky suggested the new Split Stays feature, which allows customers to book back-to-back stays at multiple home in the same area, is intended to meet this shift in demand.

With this option, which will automatically appear in search results, Airbnb users will typically see around 40% more listings when hunting for longer stays, the company says.

Airbnb’s new way to search, dubbed Airbnb Categories, lets users look for places to stay using 56 categories based on a home’s style — including options for tiny homes and yurts — as well as location and proximity to a travel activity. Chesky said this new way to search comes after people have become “more flexible about where they live and work,” a trend that Airbnb has also embraced by allowing its employees to “live and work anywhere.”

The company also announced bolstered travel protections for guests, which will be included for free with every booking. Dubbed AirCover, the protections offer users similar accommodations or refunds if their booking was canceled, if they can’t check into a home, or if the listing wasn’t as advertised. Moreover, the company said customers will get access to a 24-hour safety line if they ever feel unsafe during their stay.

Wednesday’s updates come after the company previously announced “strict anti-party measures” ahead of the summer holidays, marking its latest attempt to crack down on people seeking to use its platform to host unauthorized ragers. Chesky first announced the company’s ban on “party houses” in 2019, after five people were shot and killed at a Halloween party at an Airbnb rental house in Orinda, California.

In a fawning 3,700-word puff piece published by the Washington Post over the weekend, reporter Ruby Cramer told the embattled governor’s self-described tale of woe: Whitmer isn’t really an ambitious political climber—the daughter of well-connected and wealthy parents, she started running for office in her 20s and was elected to the Michigan legislature at age 29—but rather a misunderstood and underappreciated champion of the people targeted because of her sex, looks, anti-Trump stance, lockdown orders, and pro-abortion views, among other unjustified reasons for “right-wing” derision.

That’s Whitmer’s story, anyway.

Interviewed at the official governor’s summer residence in Mackinac Island, Whitmer and her daughters detailed the horrors of growing up in Clarence Thomas’ America while enjoying a taxpayer-funded getaway. “I live on a college campus,” Whitmer’s oldest daughter, Sherry, told Cramer. (Both daughters attend the prestigious University of Michigan.) “There are people out there who would force me into conceiving. It’s a scary thought.” She then admitted she really doesn’t have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy since she is a lesbian.

But the FBI-concocted plot to abduct and assassinate Whitmer remains a source of great angst for the governor even though she knew about it weeks, if not months, before the “kidnappers” were arrested. At some point during the summer of 2020, Whitmer told her family “there was going to be a story coming out soon about ‘some people plotting to kidnap and kill me.’” That disclosure, according to Whitmer, happened a few months after an anti-lockdown protest at the Lansing Capitol building in late April 2020.

From there, Whitmer’s recollection of the timeline gets fuzzy, if not revelatory. “When the kidnapping plot was announced, it was summer. And people were blowing up your phone, right?” Whitmer asked her daughters during the interview. “Yeah,” replied her daughter, Sydney.

Except that’s not what happened. Law enforcement made the arrests on October 7, 2020—fall, not summer. Whitmer for her part was ready to go the next day with a distraught video message blaming Donald Trump for inciting right-wing “militias” to attack her. The shocking news produced wall-to-wall negative headlines for Trump as millions of Americans were voting for president; Joe Biden took full advantage of the FBI’s latest gift to the Democratic Party, ranting from the campaign trail about Trump’s “dog whistles” to extremist groups.

But three months after the Justice Department failed to win a single conviction in the kidnapping conspiracy, a case the government considers one of its biggest domestic terror investigations in decades, not one reporter has pushed Whitmer to explain what she knew and when she knew it. Further, her public comments and FBI testimony presented during the trial earlier this year indicate Whitmer and her family knew well before the public did and that she was never in danger. Plenty of evidence suggests Whitmer was in on the scheme for months.

Rather than act like a reporter digging for answers, Cramer instead allowed Whitmer to complain about the recent acquittal of two men and a mistrial for two other defendants amid a clear case of FBI entrapment—a key detail Cramer omitted from her story.

“It was awful,” Whitmer told Cramer about the verdicts reached by her own constituents in April. “We’re supposed to expect this now? People plot to kidnap and kill a governor?”

Whitmer also complained that the attack on her is described as a “kidnapping plot” instead of an “assasination plot,” as the media correctly describes the near-miss murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last month. “Does anyone think these kidnappers wanted to keep me or ransom me?” she whined to Cramer. “No. They were going to put me on trial and then execute me. It was an assassination plot, but no one talks about it that way. Even the way people talk about it has muted the seriousness of it.”

What has “muted” the “seriousness” of the plot isn’t Whitmer’s gender but the fact at least a dozen FBI undercover agents and informants working with FBI handlers at multiple FBI field offices in the eastern half of the country stitched together the random group of innocents who did not know each other before the government got involved.

And speaking of mute, one of Whitmer’s former top aides is now very tight-lipped about the plot as the Justice Department prepares to retry the remaining two defendants, Adam Fox and Barry Croft, Jr., in Grand Rapids next month.

Mark Totten served as Whitmer’s chief legal counsel until he was confirmed as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan, the office handling the case, in late April—just a few weeks after the jury handed prosecutors a humiliating defeat in court. Shortly after his office announced plans to retry Fox and Croft, Totten, whom Whitmer praised as being on her team “since day one,” recused himself without explanation.

Defense attorneys want to know why—but the Justice Department is ignoring Freedom of Information Act requests to see Totten’s recusal memo as well as a required letter by Attorney General Merrick Garland appointing replacement counsel within the office. Joshua Blanchard, the public defender representing Barry Croft, filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department in June to compel production of the documents.

That won’t happen before the August 9 trial date, so Blanchard and Christopher Gibbons, attorney for Adam Fox, now are asking the judge to disqualify Totten’s office altogether. While admitting the motion is rare, Blanchard and Gibbons argued, “it is also rare that the United States Attorney will have previously personally represented the alleged victim of a high-profile kidnapping conspiracy.” It’s also rare that “the United States Attorney himself has determined that he must be recused from involvement in the prosecution,” the pair wrote in a July 8 filing.

Without an explanation from the government, defense counsel speculated as to the reason for Totten’s recusal. “It is reasonable to assume the disqualification is based on conflict relating to Mr. Totten’s longstanding professional relationship with the alleged victim,” referring to Whitmer.

It also is reasonable to assume Totten, like Whitmer and her family, knew of the kidnapping caper months in advance. How did they know? Did the FBI alert them? Which agents or FBI officials did Whitmer’s office communicate with before the arrests were announced on October 8, 2020? How deeply were Whitmer and her aides involved?

Not only is the media uninterested in those answers, the Justice Department is hellbent on concealing Totten’s foreknowledge from the public and, presumably, from jurors in the next trial. Prosecutors also want to prevent the jury from learning the outcome of the first trial, arguing the verdicts are “hearsay” and “irrelevant.” (Blanchard and Gibbons suggested at the last status hearing they might call the exonerated men to testify for the defense.)

Whitmer, for her part, can spin the story as hard as she wants but that doesn’t change the facts; the FBI entrapped innocent men to validate the agency’s false claims that “domestic violent extremists” loyal to Trump pose a dire threat to the country.

The governor, up for re-election in November, is far from the victim here. In fact, it appears that Whitmer, and possibly one of her top advisors, were accomplices not innocents.",Q2
https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/appomattox-campaign/,Encyclopedia Virginia,"Union general William Tecumseh Sherman, meanwhile, had marched his army first to Atlanta, Georgia, and then north through South Carolina and North Carolina. If his forces were allowed to unite with Grant’s, Union numbers would be doubled. Lee was forced to act. Because of bad road conditions and fatigued horses, Confederates had remained in their trenches through much of the spring, but on March 25, Lee attempted a surprise, pre-dawn assault against Fort Stedman. His goal was to break Grant’s stranglehold, cut his supply line, and force him to draw back his left flank, with the possible idea of creating an escape route. After an initial breakthrough, Union forces counterattacked, and in the end, Grant’s men were positioned even closer to Confederate lines.

The Campaign

In order to provide the attack on Fort Stedman more punch, Lee had borrowed troops from his right flank. Grant saw the opening and seized the initiative, sending a joint infantry and cavalry force of 21,000 men to strike the Confederate right flank and capture the South Side Railroad. Union general Gouverneur K. Warren’s Fifth Corps engaged Confederate troops under Bushrod Johnson in the battles of Quaker Road (Lewis Farm) on March 29 and White Oak Road on March 31. Union general Philip H. Sheridan‘s cavalry, meanwhile, continued farther southwest. On March 31, Sheridan maneuvered beyond the Confederate right flank but was defeated at Dinwiddie Court House by Confederates led by George E. Pickett and W. H. F. “Rooney” Lee.

On April 1, the arrival of Warren’s Fifth Corps at Pickett’s rear caused the Confederate general to fall back to an intersection known as Five Forks. There, in what has come to be known as the “Waterloo of the Confederacy,” Sheridan and Warren overwhelmed Pickett’s forces, losing fewer than a thousand men compared to Confederate casualties of about 3,000. (Warren, a hero of Gettysburg, was nevertheless relieved of his command by Sheridan after the battle. Pickett, whose name was similarly carved into history at Gettysburg, was, like Warren, humiliated at Five Forks. He was famously absent during the battle, attending a shad bake.)

Petersburg fell the next day, as did the South Side Railroad, which was captured after the Battle of Sutherland’s Station. (In another blow, Confederate general A. P. Hill, long one of Lee’s most trusted lieutenants, was killed in the fighting.) A stubborn defense at Fort Gregg allowed Lee’s army to escape to the west, and he ordered the evacuation of the capital that night. Marching on previously determined routes, Confederate forces from Richmond, Bermuda Hundred, and Petersburg all marched toward Amelia Court House. Once Lee reassembled his army, he planned to head south along the line of the Richmond and Danville Railroad to link forces with Joseph E. Johnston’s Army of Tennessee, which was moving north from North Carolina. With the two armies joined, Lee could establish a defensive line near Danville and possibly even take the offensive against Sherman.

As the march began, many Confederate soldiers were in high spirits, elated to be freed from the trenches after ten months. But after just a day, fatigue and hunger set in. On April 3, Confederate cavalry general Rufus Barringer was captured after his brigade was routed by forces under George A. Custer at Namozine Church. When Lee reached Amelia Court House on April 4, he discovered that the rations had not been delivered from Richmond as planned. Although moving quickly was essential, the Army of Northern Virginia needed supplies. Lee also needed to concentrate his forces, and decided to pause his march to wait for Richard S. Ewell‘s command—which included Lee’s son, General Custis Lee—from Richmond. In the meantime, he sent wagons into the countryside to gather provisions. Local farmers had little to spare, however, and the wagons returned virtually empty. The delay proved costly. A day’s march was lost and pursuing Union troops were allowed to draw near.

Resuming its southward march on April 5, Lee’s army traveled only a few miles before encountering dug-in Union troops at Jetersville, along the Richmond and Danville Railroad. Rather than attack, Lee maneuvered to the west toward Farmville in an attempt to outflank the Union troops and resupply his own. He did so under continuous pressure: Union cavalry general Henry Davies captured a Confederate wagon train at Painesville before being driven away by Confederate cavalry under Fitzhugh Lee, Robert E. Lee’s nephew. In order to get ahead of his Union pursuers, Lee ordered a night march, but the tired and hungry Confederate soldiers fell out of their ranks to search for food. Some simply went home.

On April 6, a Union force attempted to capture High Bridge near Farmville and prevent Lee from crossing the Appomattox River. It was defeated and captured whole by Confederate cavalry. Still, dangerous gaps began to develop in Lee’s retreating forces, the result of constant attack by Union cavalry. At Sailor’s Creek, the Union cavalry managed to exploit such a gap, cutting off two Confederate corps under generals Richard H. Anderson and Richard S. Ewell as the Union Sixth Corps arrived to their rear. Ewell’s men repulsed an initial charge by the Sixth Corps but surrendered when overwhelmed by the second. At the same time, Union cavalry charged Anderson’s men at Marshall’s Crossroads until his two divisions, led by Pickett and Bushrod Johnson, disintegrated.

Simultaneously, on the Jamestown Road to the north, the Union Second Corps attacked Confederate supply wagons and John B. Gordon’s rear guard and they struggled to cross the creek near Double Bridges. Forced to fight, Gordon’s men were driven through the wagon train and across the creek. Lee witnessed the end of the battle from a distance, exclaiming, “My God! Has the army been dissolved?” Approximately 7,700 Confederate soldiers, or about one-fifth of the Army of Northern Virginia, were killed, wounded, or captured, including nine generals. What remained crossed the Appomattox River during another night march and, on April 7, arrived in Farmville, where rations awaited them. Union forces followed so quickly, however, that the Confederates had to close the supply trains and cross the river north of Farmville and fight off Grant’s pursuing forces at the Battle of Cumberland Church.

On the evening of April 7, Grant began a three-day correspondence with Lee by inviting him to surrender. Lee shared the letter with James Longstreet, whose reply was curt: “Not yet.” Blocked once more from heading south, Lee moved west on the Richmond-Lynchburg Stage Road in hopes of resupplying at Appomattox Station. The Union Second and Sixth corps followed, while a combined force of Union cavalry, the Fifth, and parts of the Twenty-Fourth and Twenty-Fifth corps moved along shorter roads south of the Appomattox River to cut off Lee. Lee understood that he was nearly out of options. Still, if he could reach Appomattox Station first, his men could be fed before continuing toward Danville. Lee ordered another night march.

On the afternoon of April 8, the main Confederate column halted northeast of Appomattox Court House, while the reserve artillery and the ambulance and wagon trains approached Appomattox Station, several miles farther west. There, trains arrived from Lynchburg containing, among other supplies, 120,000 rations needed to feed Lee’s army. But at about four o’clock in the afternoon, Custer’s Union cavalry division captured the trains and then, in three assaults, overran the reserve artillery, securing twenty-five cannon, a thousand prisoners, and some one hundred wagons. They also blocked Lee’s line of retreat. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Lee, Union infantry marched more than thirty miles into positions to Lee’s south and west. That night, the Confederate general held a council of war with Longstreet, Gordon, and Fitzhugh Lee. Together, they determined to attempt a breakout from the looming encirclement.

At 7:50 on the morning of April 9, Gordon’s corps, supported by Fitzhugh Lee’s cavalry, attacked Colonel Charles Smith’s Union cavalry brigade, which blocked Lee’s line of retreat on the stage road. Although initially successful, the assault faltered as Union infantry arrived on the field. Gordon sent word to Lee that “my command has been fought to a frazzle … I can not long go forward.” Receiving the message, Lee said, “There is nothing left for me to do but to go and see General Grant, and I would rather die a thousand deaths.”",Q2
https://www.wral.com/fact-check-did-border-patrol-seize-enough-fentanyl-to-kill-every-american-7-times/20257987/,Fact check: Did border patrol seize enough fentanyl to kill every American 7 times?,"The United States is experiencing a major influx of a synthetic opioid called fentanyl, and the drug is being blamed for a surge in deaths.

Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that of the more than 100,000 people who died from drug overdoses in the U.S. between May 2020 and April 2021, almost two-thirds were linked to fentanyl or similar synthetic opioids.

In an April 1 press release , U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., raised the alarm about fentanyl being smuggled into the United States.

""In Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21), 11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized by Customs and Border Protection, which is enough to kill every American nearly seven times over,"" Tenney said.

Tenney argued that the Biden administration should back off its intention to terminate Title 42, a public health order that has been in place since March 2020 that allows officials to expel migrants at U.S. land borders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. (On April 26, the administration said it would abide by a judge’s order to keep Title 42 in place for now.)

We won’t offer a view on whether extending Title 42 would reduce the prevalence of fentanyl in the United States. However, we decided to take a closer look at Tenney’s statement about fentanyl and how deadly it is. Tenney’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

On the scale of fentanyl confiscations, Tenney correctly cited the data. U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures show that 11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized nationwide during fiscal year 2021, just as Tenney said. This represented an increase of 134% over the previous fiscal year.

Most of it was seized at the southwest border at official ports of entry.

But could it really kill every American nearly seven times over?

There’s little question that fentanyl is a deadly substance. It’s up to 50 times more powerful than heroin, and up to 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the CDC . Many overdoses are occurring because ""drug dealers have been mixing fentanyl with other drugs including heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine"" due to its low cost and potency, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. This heightens the risk of a fatal dose.

Experts say that two milligrams is a widely accepted lethal dose for fentanyl.

To vet Tenney’s math, we reached out to Lewis S. Nelson, a professor and chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and director of its division of medical toxicology.

Tenney’s numbers, Nelson said, are basically on target.

Nelson said that 11,201 pounds amounts to 5,080,688 grams, or 5,080,688,000 milligrams. If 2 milligrams is a lethal dose, then the amount seized would equal 2,540,344,000 lethal doses.

The projected U.S. population for 2022 is roughly 332.4 million, so the amount seized would be enough to kill every American 7.64 times over, which is close to what Tenney said.

There’s one caveat: There is some variation in the lethal dose for body size and tolerance from past exposure.

In 2019, in looking at a similar claim , PolitiFact West Virginia interviewed Timothy J. Pifer, the director of the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory and a specialist on fentanyl and its lethality.

He said that some bigger individuals with higher levels of past exposure might only die with a 3-milligram dose, rather than 2 milligrams. In addition, Pifer said, how pure the fentanyl is can make a difference in its lethality.

In all, these variations could change the math on the margins. Still, simply taking the statement as a way to understand the scope of the fentanyl being seized, Tenney’s calculations are reasonable.

PolitiFact ruling

Tenney said that in 2021, ""11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized by Customs and Border Protection, which is enough to kill every American nearly seven times over.""

She is correct that 11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized nationwide in 2021, and she’s essentially accurate about how deadly that supply could be. Using a standard fatal dose of 2 milligrams, the amount seized in 2021 would have been enough to kill every American 7.64 times over. The fatal dose could vary depending on body size, past exposure to fentanyl, and purity, possibly affecting the calculation on the margins.

We rate the statement Mostly True.",Q2

For globalization to survive the war in Ukraine, the United States must do better and be better. It is unclear whether the world's greatest democracy has the wherewithal to manage this.



Unfair? It may seem so. President Joe Biden has done a creditable job of rallying the West to Ukraine's side as it battles a brutal Russian invasion. By going public early and often with good U.S. intelligence, Biden has kept ahead of clumsy Russian propaganda and disinformation.



The feared devastating cyberstrikes against the West have not (yet) materialized, reportedly thanks to preemptive work by U.S. security services. It's leadership the likes of which we've not seen from Washington in recent memory.



And that's the problem. Biden has a steady hand now. For how long? How long until Washington's next hugely damaging strategic mistake?



For the current moment did not rise from nowhere, out of the suddenly maniacal, homicidal mind of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been this way for some time, and this war has had two decades of runway. At critical junctures, the United States either vastly overplayed or underplayed its hand.



Recall that in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, thousands of Canadians gathered on Parliament Hill to show their solidarity with Americans. Similar scenes took place worldwide. Not long after, a NATO-led coalition of more than 40 countries joined the U.S. effort in Afghanistan, vowing to bring security and prosperity to a country shattered by decades of war.



But there is, of course, neither security nor prosperity today in Afghanistan. The last American soldier departed last year in a rout. Afghan women and girls, whose education NATO soldiers championed, are on their own. So are the many thousands of other Afghans ― journalists, interpreters, fixers, officials of civil society ― who believed Western promises.



And even as the United States and NATO were making those solemn pledges to the Afghan people, the U.S. security establishment, led by President George W. Bush, was rushing headlong toward a war of choice in Iraq in 2003.



It is hard to not to see parallels between Putin's invasion of Ukraine and Bush's in Iraq two decades earlier. To be sure, Ukraine is a democracy, and Saddam Hussein's Iraq was not. The catastrophe that followed the Iraq War, as the Iraqi state collapsed and the Islamic State militant group began its ascent, was no less horrific for all that.



Bush hoped to seed democracy across the Middle East. Instead, his war set a match to a tinderbox. A few years later, a different American president coping with the consequences drew a red line for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, forbidding his use of chemical weapons against his own people.



Assad, with Russian backing, ignored Barack Obama's warning ― without consequence. America had overreached in Iraq. Now, apparently, it would underextend in Syria in the face of atrocity.



Unrelenting regional chaos caused waves of its own ― including a flood of irregular migration toward the relative safe haven of Europe. By late 2015, the Syrian refugee crisis was roiling election campaigns in Canada, fueling Brexit rhetoric in Britain and serving as fodder for a nativist backlash in the United States.



Real estate developer and pageant promoter Donald Trump rode the ""fear of the other"" to power the following November ― with help from Putin's Russia.



There isn't room here to catalog the historic degree of harm done to the United States, to its standing in the world, to NATO, to the global institutions of liberal trade and multilateralism built with American leadership after 1945, during Trump's tenure.



The fact that declared Republican voters overwhelmingly favor his return to the White House, even after his followers stormed the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, should be shocking and terrifying.



Instead, such is the lassitude caused by frequent exposure to the unthinkable ― it's mostly met with a shrug. More Benito Mussolini than Napoleon Bonaparte, Trump is an incompetent. He and his movement nevertheless represent the greatest risk to American democracy, and thus global democracy, since World War II.



This isn't to say that liberalism, globalized trade and the institutions developed to support it, such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, G-20, International Criminal Court and United Nations, are doomed. But they are in peril. Russia now seeks to smash the U.S.-led global order. China is watching, learning and biding its time. No one knows how it will end.



The Iraq War was a critical step in the descent to this moment of severe global risk. There can be no wars of choice, if there is to be a global community. That is a lesson of Ukraine, as much as the wickedness of Putin.

https://www.pressherald.com/2022/04/26/climate-activists-self-immolation-raises-questions-about-faith-protest/,"Climate activist’s self-immolation raises questions about faith, protest","Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old climate activist and Buddhist, set himself on fire in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, prompting a national conversation about his motivation and whether he may have been inspired by Buddhist monks who self-immolated in the past to protest government atrocities.

Bruce, a photographer from Boulder, Colorado, walked up to the plaza of the Supreme Court around 6:30 p.m. Friday – on Earth Day – then sat down and set himself ablaze, a law enforcement official said. Supreme Court police officers responded immediately but were unable to extinguish the blaze in time to save him.

Investigators, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said they did not immediately locate a manifesto or note at the scene and that officials were still working to determine a motive.

On Saturday, Kritee Kanko, a Zen Buddhist priest who described herself as Bruce’s friend, shared an emotional post on her public Twitter account saying his self-immolation was “not suicide” but “a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis.”

She added that Bruce had been planning the act for at least a year. She wrote: “#wynnbruce I am so moved.” She got sympathetic responses as well as backlash.

Kanko and other members of the Rocky Mountain Ecodharma Retreat Center in Boulder, released a statement Monday saying “none of the Buddhist teachers in the Boulder area knew about (Bruce’s) plans to self-immolate on this Earth Day,” and that had they known about his plan, they would have stopped him. Bruce was a frequent visitor to the Buddhist retreat center in the mountains, where he meditated with the community, Kanko said.

“We have never talked about self-immolation, and we do not think self-immolation is a climate action,” the statement said. “Nevertheless, given the dire state of the planet and worsening climate crisis, we understand why someone might do that.”

On Facebook, Bruce wrote about following the spiritual tradition of Shambhala, which combines Tibetan Buddhism with the principles of living “an uplifted life, fully engaged with the world,” according to the Boulder Shambhala Center. Bruce also posted praise for Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, a leader of engaged Buddhism, around the time of his death in January.

Bruce’s act of sitting down and setting himself on fire was reminiscent of the events of June 11, 1963, when Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese monk, seated cross-legged, burned himself to death at a busy Saigon intersection. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government led by Ngo Dinh Diem, a staunch Catholic.

In a letter to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr,. whom Hanh counted as a friend, Hanh wrote that he drew inspiration from the Vietnamese monk’s self-sacrifice, saying: “To burn oneself by fire is to prove what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity.”

In Tibet, anti-Chinese activists have employed self-immolation as a form of protest. The International Campaign for Tibet says 131 men and 28 women – monks, nuns and laypeople among them – have self-immolated since 2009 to protest against Beijing’s strict controls over the region and their religion.

Buddhism as a religion does not unilaterally condone the act of self-immolation or taking one’s life, said Robert Barnett, a London-based researcher of modern Tibetan history and politics.

“Killing yourself is considered damaging in Buddhism because life is precious,” he said. “But if a person self-immolates because of a higher motivation and it’s not out of a negative emotion such as depression or sadness, then the Buddhist position becomes far more complex.”

If self-immolation is done to help the world, it might be accepted as a positive action, Barnett said. He cited a story from the “Jataka Tales,” a body of South Asian literature concerning the prior incarnations of the Buddha in human and animal form. In that particular tale, an incarnation of the Buddha, in an act of selfless compassion, offers himself to an emaciated tigress who was so hungry that she was ready to devour her own cubs.

“But that kind of self-sacrifice is not encouraged, developed or talked about for normal people (other than the Buddha),” he said, adding that this is because of “the immense difficulty of cultivating positive motivation in any situation, let alone maintaining it under stress or in conditions of extreme pain.”

Buddhism emphasizes emotional balance, inclusiveness, kindness, compassion and wisdom, said Roshi Joan Halifax, an environmental activist and abbot of the Upaya Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

“What we’re seeing today among many people is hopelessness,” she said. “What we are called to do is not to be disabled by that sense of futility, but to transform our moral suffering into wise hope and courageous action.”

Despite the pessimism that some climate activists may feel, there is reason to remain hopeful, Halifax said.

“You see that people are waking up to the magnitude of the climate catastrophe,” she said, noting that countries and corporations are moving away from damaging practices and toward clean energy.

“I feel inspired and hopeful by our ability to change and adapt in this ever-changing world,” she said. “My heart is heavy that (Bruce) did not have that kind of optimism.”

Those who knew Bruce saw a man who was kind, playful and idealistic – an avid dancer who participated in weekly events. He was also known for biking and embracing public transportation.

Bruce, who enjoyed the outdoors, brought an intensity to whatever he did, said his friend Jeffry Buechler. On Buechler’s wedding day in 2014, Bruce, on a whim, decided to go for a dip in a cold mountain lake early in the morning, he said.

Bruce also suffered lasting effects from a brain injury he sustained in a car wreck that killed his best friend about 30 years ago, Buechler said.

Marco DeGaetano, who met Bruce in the 1990s when they both attended a Universalist church in Denver, said “Wynn seemed to have an affinity for people who needed help.”

He recalled Bruce being kind to a church member with a mental illness when others distanced themselves.

DeGaetano said he last saw Bruce about a month ago, and he seemed outgoing and friendly as always – every time he saw Bruce, “he had a smile on his face.”",Q2
https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2022/06/20/biden-makes-a-very-telling-comment-about-who-is-making-up-his-mind-n581187,Biden Makes a Very Telling Comment About Who Is Making up His Mind,"Joe Biden has been at his house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware for the weekend. They generally refuse to be transparent about what he’s doing when he’s in Delaware or with whom he is meeting. That’s concerning since he’s spent so much time there — he’s spent around 200 full or partial days away from the White House, most of those in Delaware. But we did see how he fell over on his bike in a hard fall this weekend after he came to stop to greet people. The response of his deputy press secretary was not to tell us how he was, but to tweet a juvenile attack on President Donald Trump.

His team has claimed that even on these trips, he is “constantly on the job, regardless of their location — whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington.” But Biden blew that narrative that he wasn’t on vacation when he gave a prickly response to a reporter who asked him whether he would be talking to Chinese President Xi Jinping. “I will not talk to you! I’m on vacation,” he said, although he then said he would be talking with Xi. Each of those “vacations” to Delaware is costing us about $120,000 for just security alone, not counting the plane and the helicopter costs, or any of the other costs.

But that vacation comment wasn’t the only comment that Biden made to reporters. While that one blew up the fiction that he was “constantly on the job,” he had another one that raised even a bigger question — exactly who is pulling his strings?

When a reporter asked if he was talking to Xi, he said, “I ain’t telling ya.” When he was asked if he had made up his mind on China tariffs, he said “We’re in the process of doing that.” The reporter, surprised, asked if that meant he was lifting tariffs? That’s when he made this telling comment:

Reporter: “You’re lifting the tariffs [on China]?” Biden: “WE are in the process of making up MY mind.” pic.twitter.com/A95B7gz0cq — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 19, 2022

“We are in the process of making up my mind,” Biden replied. “Prepared to sign it and I’m ready to go.”

“WE are in the process of making up MY mind?” Talk about a strange, yet revealing comment. Did he just say the quiet part out loud? Who is the “we” who will be “making up” Biden’s mind? Isn’t he supposed to be the leader of the free world? Why is he in office if someone else is pulling the switches?

We talked about transparency with whom he’s meeting in Delaware, how about transparency about who is telling him what to do? Then his last comment doesn’t even follow — if he’s “prepared to sign it” and “ready to go,” hasn’t he made up his mind? It sounds like he’s waiting for someone else’s go-ahead. Who would that be? Who’s running the country and telling him what to do? That’s more than a little concerning and perhaps is part of the reason everything is a mess.",Q2
https://www.dawn.com/news/1686920/3-chinese-nationals-among-4-dead-in-blast-at-karachi-university,3 Chinese nationals among 4 dead in suicide attack at Karachi University,"At least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi's (KU) Confucius Institute, officials said on Tuesday.

The incident happened as a van, carrying staff members, was about to enter the Confucius Institute, located next to the commerce department.

Television footage showed a white van in flames with plumes of smoke rising from its remains. The windows of nearby buildings were also seen shattered from the impact of the explosion.

CCTV footage of the attack showed a burqa-clad woman standing outside the entrance of the Confucius Institute. The woman detonated herself just as the van neared the institute's entrance.

Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar confirmed that four people had died. A handout from Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah’s office quoted the IGP as saying that the blast took place at approximately 2:30pm.

The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.

A spokesperson for the university confirmed that three of the victims were Chinese nationals. They were identified as Confucius Institute Director Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng and Chen Sai. The fourth victim was the van’s driver, Khalid.

The spokesperson also identified two of the injured as Wang Yuqing, a Chinese faculty member, and Hamid.

""Academic activities and public dealings will remain suspended at KU on Wednesday (tomorrow) to mourn the loss of the Confucius Institute's faculty members,"" the spokesperson said.

Earlier in the day, SSP East Syed Abdul Rahim Sherazi had hinted that a ""couple"" of Chinese nationals, who were part of KU faculty, were among the deceased.

Ball bearings found

Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official Raja Umar Khattab said that the suicide attack was carried out by a woman, adding that ball bearings were found at the site of the blast.

He said the van was properly guarded as a Rangers team was escorting it which was why an improvised explosive device (IED) was not used.

Responding to a question, the CTD official said he did not believe a security lapse was the reason behind the attack since thousands of students were coming and going out of the university and checking each of them was a problem.

Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon said that it was unfortunate that teachers had been targeted. Speaking to the media, he said that four others had been injured, including a Chinese national, a private security guard and a Rangers personnel.

Memon said that a Rangers team was accompanying the Chinese nationals. Asked whether a threat had been issued prior to the attack, the senior officer said that there was ""always a threat"".

He said tight security arrangements were already in place at the varsity, adding that any lapses would be ""revisited"". ""Give us time to look at the CCTV footage and interview witnesses,"" he said.

Speaking to the media earlier, DIG East Muqaddas Haider said initial information showed the van was headed to the institute after leaving the hostel.

""The explosion took place at the van's right side at the [institute's] entrance,"" Haider said, confirming that four people had been killed.

'Cowardly incident direct attack on Pak-China ties'

Later in the day, the Foreign Office (FO) issued a statement condemning the ""reprehensible terrorist attack"".

In a statement, FO spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said the government and the people of Pakistan extend their deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims.

""The law enforcement agencies are investigating the incident to apprehend the culprits and bring them to justice. Local authorities are also providing all possible assistance to the injured,"" he said.

The FO spokesperson termed the incident a ""direct attack on the Pakistan-China friendship and ongoing cooperation"".

Calling the two countries ""close friends"" and ""iron brothers"", he said Pakistan attached great importance to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects and institutions in the country.

'Amazing teacher'

Mustajab Hussain, a 25-year-old student hailing from Gilgit-Baltistan, was heartbroken over the death of one of his teachers.

Hussain, who has been studying at the Confucius Institute for the past three years, said that two female faculty members were among the deceased while the third one was the director, based on the identities shared by the KU spokesperson. The director had just come around a month ago.

“Chen Sai was my teacher. Her class was at 2:30pm. She was an amazing teacher and very friendly. Whatever we found difficult, she would always explain very nicely. She was very young, in her early 20s,"" he said.

According to Hussain, the Chinese faculty members used to live at a guest house inside the KU premises. They were coming from the guest house to the institute when the explosion occurred at the gate.

Sindh CM visits Chinese consulate

Meanwhile, the Sindh chief minister paid a visit to the Chinese Consulate where he briefed Consul General Li Bijian about the blast.

Shah expressed grief over the death of the Chinese nationals, a statement issued by the CM's office said. The chief minister also assured the Chinese official that the incident would be fully investigated, the statement added.

""Those involved in the incident will be brought to justice. We value the services rendered by Chinese experts in the country and the province,"" Shah said.

""Some elements do not like the partnership between the two countries,"" he said, adding that the miscreants behind the incident would be dealt with an iron hand.

Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief over the blast in a telephone call with the Sindh chief minister. The premier assured Shah of the Centre's full help and cooperation in dealing with such incidents.

Condemnations

According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz called Shah to collect information about the ""terrorist incident"".

""The prime minister said that terrorists are [the] enemies of Pakistan. He vowed to eliminate the remainder of terrorists through collective efforts and unity. He directed for the provision of the best medical facilities to the injured,"" the PMO said.

The prime minister also issued a statement on Twitter, saying that he was ""deeply grieved"" over the loss of precious lives and termed it a ""heinous attack"".

""My heartfelt condolences go to the bereaved families. I strongly condemn this cowardly act of terrorism. The perpetrators will surely be brought to justice,"" he said.

PTI leader Asad Umar said the attack was ""yet another attempt to derail the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and sabotage the economic development of Pakistan.""

""The whole nation should be united in its resolve to defeat the aims of these anti-Pakistan hostile forces,"" he said.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack and prayed for the lives lost. ""Sindh police will soon get to the bottom of the incident,"" he said, adding that the perpetrators would be punished.

He called for steps to be taken to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens.

Three retired judges have been appointed by the chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court to consider suspending Dover Mayor Richard P. Homrighausen from office.

According to an April 6 announcement on the court's website, Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor appointed three former common pleas court judges to serve as a special commission to consider suspending Homrighausen in relation to felony charges pertaining to official conduct in office.

More:Dover mayor could face prison, fines and forfeiture of state pension if convicted

They are Judge John G. Haas, formerly of Stark County Common Pleas Court, Judge R. Alan Corbin, formerly of Brown County Common Pleas Court, and Judge Reeve W. Kelsey, formerly of Wood County Common Pleas Court.

Their appointment followed a March 14 request from Robert F. Smith, assistant legal counsel in the Special Investigations Unit of State Auditor Keith Faber, to initiate the process.

Under state law, all meetings of the special commission are closed to the public; records are not made available to the public until the body issues its written report or otherwise concludes its proceedings. The law gives both sides a chance to submit evidence supporting and opposing suspension.

The process is expected to take 57 days, meanings a decision could be reached around May 10.

A letter addressed to Homrighausen from the Ohio Supreme Court was delivered to Dover City Hall on Monday.

Homrighausen has pleaded not guilty to 15 charges contained in a March indictment by the Tuscarawas County grand jury. They are theft in office, a third-degree felony; one count of having an unlawful interest in a public contract, a fourth-degree felony; six counts of filing incomplete, false, and fraudulent returns, all fifth-degree felonies; four counts of soliciting improper compensation, all first-degree misdemeanors; two counts of dereliction of duty, both second-decree misdemeanors; and one count of representation by a public official or employee, a first-degree misdemeanor.

State auditors determined Homrighausen performed 231 marriages between January 2014 and May 2021 and received payments totaling $9,295 in cash and checks that he failed to remit to the city. He is charged with failing to report the income on tax returns. Two charges relate to the employment of the mayor's son, Peter, with the city.

A jury trial in Homrighausen's criminal case is scheduled for Sept. 20 before Tuscarawas County Common Pleas Judge Elizabeth Lehigh Thomakos.

The mayor be sent to prison, fined and lose his state pension if convicted on some or all of the charges.

Homrighausen, in his eighth term as mayor, was first elected in 1991 and most recently reelected in 2019.",Q2

‘See the Quilt and Understand’

In the early days of the AIDS Memorial Quilt we had a slogan: See the Quilt and Understand. In those days, the general public had little knowledge of AIDS. There was fear, and misinformation, and stigma. The Quilt, created out of both rage at the government’s response to the pandemic, and raw, overwhelming grief at the losses we suffered, put a human face on this urgent public health crisis. People all across our country saw the thousands of handmade panels that individuals made to memorialize their loved ones, and began to understand the toll of the disease in human terms.

On June 11 and 12 we are commemorating the 35th anniversary of the AIDS Memorial Quilt with the largest display ever seen in San Francisco. The free public display will take place from 10 am to 5 pm each day in Robin Williams Meadow. An opening ceremony and traditional Quilt unfolding will start at 9:30 am on June 11, followed by the continuous reading of names of lives lost to AIDS on both days. There will be a closing ceremony at 4 pm on Sunday, June 12, where newly-made panels will be presented and added to the Quilt.

I made my first panel for the Quilt in 1988, to remember my friend David Percival. I’ve made several others since then, and am trying to finish others in time for the June display. Since 1989, I have coordinated the reading of names at displays in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. As visitors look at the panels, they hear the names being read. The names provide a profound audio counterpart to the visual impact of the Quilt. And so many people find that taking part in the reading of names is a deeply emotional, transformative experience.

I will never forget a woman I met while reading the names at a Quilt display in Washington, D.C., in 2012. She came across our display while walking through the National Mall, and stopped at our Reader tent, in tears. She told me, “My brother died of AIDS 20 years ago, and no one will talk about it. No one says his name. I can’t talk about it with anyone.” At our Quilt display, she found a safe place where she could say her beloved brother’s name aloud, and honor him with dignity. She found a place where people understood her experience, and her grief.

Come see the Quilt on June 11 and 12, and understand. And help us remember their names. https://www.aidsmemorial.org/quilt35

If It’s Rainbow It Must Be Pride Month

Market Street is lined with rainbow flags, the Pink Triangle is ablaze and a-flutter on Twin Peaks, storefronts are filled with rainbow-washed merchandise: it must be Pride Month. And after two years of virtual events, San Francisco seems ready to party—the calendar is jam-packed with Pride-themed events throughout the month.

This month’s calendar is also filled with activism, from this week’s California primary election to increasingly revved-up preparations for the midterm elections, to the nation-wide march against gun violence on June 11, to the fact that the Supreme Court traditionally releases its opinions in late June. There will be plenty of opportunities for hitting the streets and making our voices heard.

March Against Gun Violence

The funerals of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, had hardly started on June 1 when word came out of another mass shooting, in a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And the mayhem continues every day, despite the fact that across the country the outcry against gun violence is becoming too loud for even recalcitrant lawmakers to ignore. People are crying out for meaningful, effective change to our gun laws, and we must hold our elected officials accountable.

On Saturday, June 11, March for Our Lives is organizing a huge rally in Washington, D.C., and hundreds of solidarity marches have been taking place across the country with more to come. There are several in the Bay Area, including one on June 6 that started at the Golden Gate Bridge Toll Plaza in San Francisco. Participants marched across the bridge from 9 am to 10 am, many wearing orange. The significance of that color for the marches dates to at least 2013, when 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was shot and killed in Chicago in a case of mistaken identity. Friends mourning her loss chose the color orange because hunters traditionally wear that color to avoid being shot by other hunters.

The Supreme Court and You

The Supreme Court generally releases the majority of its decisions in mid-to-late June. This year, all eyes will be on these decisions, especially after the recent leak regarding SCOTUS’ upcoming decision on abortion rights. Fundamental rights that affect all of us are at stake.

One useful place to follow these issues and learn more about the inner workings of the Supreme Court is SCOTUSblog. SCOTUSblog is devoted to covering the U.S. Supreme Court comprehensively, without bias and according to the highest journalistic and legal ethical standards. The blog is provided as a public service. While following landmark cases like United States v Windsor (which declared the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional) and Obergefell v Hodges (the case that gave same-sex couples the right to marry), following SCOTUSblog became a daily obsession and indispensable tool.

The deal, which needs approval by the court to become final, would resolve litigation filed two years ago by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and rights groups accusing Clearview of violating a strict biometric privacy law in the state of Illinois.

A main provision of the settlement permanently bans Clearview from making its “faceprint” database available to most businesses or other private entities in the country, according the ACLU.

“Clearview can no longer treat people’s unique biometric identifiers as an unrestricted source of profit,” said ACLU speech, privacy and technology director Nathan Freed Wessler.

“Before this agreement, Clearview ignored the fact that biometric information can be misused to create dangerous situations and threats” to lives, said Linda Xochitl Tortolero, chief executive of Chicago-based nonprofit Mujeres Latinas en Accion.

“Today that’s no longer the case.”

Clearview will also stop its practice of offering free trial accounts to police officers without the knowledge or approval of their employers, the ACLU said.

The ban does not limit Clearview from working with federal or state agencies other than those in Illinois, the lawsuit said.

Clearview admits no wrongdoing in the settlement.

Clearview AI says it has built up a database of more than 10 billion facial images taken from public websites, ranging from social media to news portals, which it touts as a tool for law enforcement.

– Still checking faces –

Clearview chief executive Hoan Ton-That said the company has told the court that it intends to make its facial recognition software available to commercial customers, without the database of images.

“Clearview AI’s posture regarding sales to private entities remains unchanged,” the chief executive said in response to an AFP inquiry.

Facial recognition is used to unlock smartphones, verify identities, board aircraft and more, he noted.

The settlement does not require any “material change” in the Clearview business model,” said Cahill Gordon, an attorney representing the company.

Campaigners have condemned Clearview’s use of images for being open to abuse, and a number of groups including Privacy International last year filed complaints with data regulators in France, Austria, Italy, Greece and Britain.

Italy’s data privacy watchdog in March fined Clearview 20 million euros (almost $22 million) over its facial recognition software.

The watchdog ordered the company to delete data relating to people in Italy and banned it from further collection and processing of information there.

France’s privacy watchdog as well in December ordered Clearview to delete data on its citizens and cease further collection.

Meanwhile in June last year, Canada’s independent parliamentary watchdog ruled that both Clearview’s database and the use of it by federal police were illegal.",Q2

On Monday, a West Chester police captain took the stand to explain how the recordings were made - and why they were critical to the investigation and ultimate arrests and charges. Capt. Seth Hagaman was working as a homicide investigator with Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigations at the time of the killings and wrote the majority of the warrants for listening devices and cellphone monitoring against the Wagner family.

Capt. Hagaman told the court about the difficulty of the investigation, and the requirements to get an intercept warrant approved to monitor calls and conversations between the family members.

""We were out of home run balls,"" Hagaman said. ""We were out of things that we thought that this investigative act alone could produce. We were at a point where we thought we were building a circumstantial case where every piece mattered.""

Hagaman said BCI placed four listening devices in an R&L Carriers tractor trailer that George and his brother Edward ""Jake"" Wagner drove for work in 2018. At the same time, Hagaman said, BCI was doing monitoring on five cell phones, even though family members sometimes changed numbers. And the Wagners were suspicious something was up.

""There were times when they said ‘let’s not talk bout this on the phone, let’s talk when we get home,'"" Hagaman said.

All four Wagner family members were interviewed at the Montana border with Canada when they were moving back to Ohio in 2018, he said. Each interview lasted ""a couple of hours."" We learned through George Wagner's defense attorney John Patrick Parker's cross-examination that was the first and last time George was interviewed in relation to the murders.

Hagaman also told the court there was probable cause through the investigation, including inconsistent stories from that interview. He said George and Jake dyed their hair int he week leading up to the murders, and watched a clip from the movie ""The Boondock Saints"" - about two brothers who killed for vigilante justice - the evening of the massacre.

Hagaman said George got a tattoo after the killings. It features a skull, eight ball, and the so-called ""dead man's hand"" of cards showing aces and eights. Wagner's defense team called that ""speculative"" in relation to the murders.

""Do you have a direct confession from George?"" Parker asked. Hagaman answered that he did not.

The victims — eight members of the Rhoden and Gilley families — were executed overnight in April 2016, many of them while they slept, at four different crime scenes across the county. A custody dispute over Jake Wagner's daughter with Hanna Rhoden prompted the planning of execution of the massacre, investigators said.

Jake Wagner pleaded guilty to murder — reportedly confessing to killing at least five of the family members — on the fifth anniversary of the massacre. As part of the plea deal, none of the Wagner family members will face the death penalty if Jake testifies against them at trial.

George Wagner and his dad Billy have not taken a plea deal.

George Wagner will be back in court June 21, ahead of a trial date set this summer.

Pfc. Isaac Romero had completed his first year as a Marine the day before he drowned Sunday just off a beach on the Hawaii base where he was stationed, the Marine Corps said Wednesday.

Romero, 22, a Minnesota native, was assigned to Marine Wing Support Squadron 174 at Marine Corps Base Hawaii on Oahu in December after completing training as a combat engineer, according to a Marine Corps news release.

His death prompted the base commander to temporarily close several of the base's beaches beginning Wednesday to conduct a review of beach safety procedures and risk management practices, the Marine Corps said.

They will remain closed until Wednesday.

Romero was swimming in the afternoon from North Beach on the base, leaving a friend behind on land.

He had swum out about 60 yards before the friend lost sight of him, the Marine Corps said. The friend called the base Provost Marshal's Office at 2 p.m., and first responders from the base and Honolulu Fire Department soon arrived.

They found his body in shallow water about 45 minutes later. He was pronounced dead at 3:42 p.m. at Castle Medical Center, the Marine Corps said.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service and local authorities are still looking into Romero’s death.

“Our heartfelt sympathies and deepest condolences go out to Isaac's family and friends, and we join them in remembering and mourning this Marine,” Lt. Col. Gideon Grissett, commander of Marine Wing Support Squadron 174, said in the news release.

""His enthusiasm and devotion to duty inspired others with his positive, upbeat attitude. We are grateful to have had the opportunity to know him and be a part of our Marine Corps family.""

But in a post-Roe era, experts urge caution","

CNN

By Christina Maxouris, CNN

The heartfelt messages spread across social media within hours of the seismic Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade: If you need assistance getting an abortion in another state, I can help.

“We have to support each other, (let) people know that they’re not alone,” said Stephany Bolivar, who lives in Brooklyn, New York. In a Facebook post, she offered to house anyone who needed to travel to New York to get an abortion. Then, she messaged several young women she once babysat in Georgia, where Bolivar grew up, and extended the offer, should they ever need it.

“I just feel like we have to stick with each other,” Bolivar said. “This affects everyone.”

Eddie Phanichkul, who lives in Milwaukee, posted that he would help cover transportation expenses for anyone who needed to travel to a neighboring state to get an abortion. His inspiration, in part, was thinking about the rights taken away from his baby daughter.

They were among the hundreds of people who, angered by the ruling, posted similar messages with offers such as financial assistance or lodging for Americans who would need to travel across state lines to get an abortion. Some used coded phrases, while others, like Phanichkul and Bolivar, were more direct.

But while many of the offers may come with good intentions, abortion rights activists and legal experts warn that in post-Roe America — and in an age of unprecedented digital surveillance — those online communications may come with complicated safety and legal risks for both parties as a patchwork of drastically different abortion laws begin to take shape and go into effect.

Some posters may be looking to scam vulnerable individuals while in other cases the communications may create digital trails that might be used for potential prosecutions, legal experts told CNN.

“There are people out there who are sincere and would welcome a stranger into their home,” said Khiara M. Bridges, a professor of law at UC Berkeley School of Law. “But I do think that it poses some questions about opening themselves up to liability.”

The National Network of Abortion Funds told CNN it saw both demand and donations skyrocket since the court’s ruling and urged individuals seeking abortions to reach out to an established abortion fund or local clinic.

“When someone is facing barriers to care, it’s often complex. Often, it’s more than one compounding barrier and abortion funds really hold that specific expertise in helping callers overcome obstacles, including funding, travel, lodging, child care, language barriers,” said NNAF managing director Debasri Ghosh.

“It’s amazing that there is such an outpouring of support,” Ghosh added. “We want to make sure that that energy is directed in a way that really helps people access care, with attention to their safety and privacy.”

Why they’re offering to help

Phanichkul said he was stunned by the ruling. Shortly after the reversal of Roe v. Wade, a 19th-century law banning abortion went into effect in Wisconsin after the state’s Republican-controlled legislature declined to repeal it earlier that week.

In neighboring Minnesota, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order designed to shield women seeking abortions there from being subject to legal consequences in other states. And Illinois has a sweeping abortion access protection law that went into effect in 2019.

Feeling frustrated and blindsided, Phanichkul wrote a short post offering to help pay for or set up transportation to Minnesota or Illinois for anyone in Wisconsin who needed to get the procedure. “If somebody is really struggling, I’m more than willing to help find resources, help pay for it, help drive them,” he told CNN.

Bolivar, who works as a software engineer in Brooklyn, said she also thought about the many people around her who are impacted: the young women from her home state who were now headed off to college and her college best friend, who years ago needed the procedure. Bolivar said she wanted those close to her — and anyone who found her post — to know she was there to help in her own, small way.

“It was very frustrating,” she said. “(The emotions) just kind of really range still from like really, really angry and just extremely pissed off to just sad and trying to figure out what I can do to help.”

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul earlier in June signed a slate of bills aimed at protecting out-of-state patients and abortion providers from legal action in other states, with five of the six bills passed taking effect immediately. Meanwhile, Georgia has a restrictive law that will likely take effect soon, which bans abortions when a “fetal heartbeat” is detected, at about six weeks into a pregnancy — before many people know they’re pregnant.

Sydnee Corriders, a therapist and racial equity consultant in Brooklyn, said she was grieving after the ruling and wanted to act as a resource for those around her who may need help finding organizations to contact or needed other kinds of help.

“As long as I’m able, I will pay for/contribute to anyone without access to abortions, getting the care they need,” she wrote on Twitter, while offering to help people find therapy options as well.

“I’m not wealthy or rich by any means, but being able to have a steady income … I wanted to show up as a community member and acknowledge my privilege and be able to put some funds forward for those in my community and beyond who might be in need,” she said.

An ‘unprecedented’ legal landscape

But at a time when jurisdictions across America are so divided on the issue of abortion — and how aggressively to prosecute those seeking the procedure — simple offers of help like these can get complicated. For example, there are many questions about whether there are legal consequences for residents who seek the procedure across state lines — and those who help.

The fraught legal landscape was touched on by the three dissenting judges in the Supreme Court decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, who wrote the ruling “invites a host of questions about interstate conflicts,” including whether a state can bar women from traveling to another state for an abortion — and puts the Supreme Court at the center of what will soon likely be “interjurisdictional abortion wars.”

The National Right to Life Committee, the oldest and largest anti-abortion group in the country, is already pushing for states to restrict those “conspiring to cause, or aiding or abetting, illegal abortions,” the “trafficking” of abortion-inducing drugs and “abortion trafficking” of a minor.

“It’s just going to kind of depend on which anti-abortion state decide to do this first, which providers, or helpers or patients they target, what the state law says, what the abortion-supportive state law says and how they fight it out,” said Greer Donley, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School. “These are going to be extremely complicated questions.”

“I’m not exactly sure if there’s ever been an example in history, or at least modern history, where the states have been so divided and have such intense interest in opposing directions,” Donley added. “It’s certainly unprecedented, in modern history.”

What experts say you should consider

It’s not just legal concerns that experts and advocates worry about — especially for the ones who would be seeking to travel for the procedure. Law professor Rachel Rebouché, the interim dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law, said she worries some of the online offers of help may be attempts to spread misinformation or take advantage of vulnerable individuals.

Others worry about the privacy implication of information posted online.

“We all know that our data is not safe on social media, that there are very few privacy protections when you engage with social media apps,” Bridges said. “It would be surprising to me if that data isn’t being surveilled.”

Digital rights experts have warned that people’s search histories, location data and other digital information could be used by law enforcement agencies investigating or prosecuting abortion-related cases. Civil rights attorney Cynthia Conti-Cook previously told CNN that a number of online behaviors — including search history, call and text logs and emails — could become part of investigations and court proceedings in states where helping to provide access to abortions is criminalized.

It’s why abortion rights advocates urge anyone seeking an abortion to look to established organizations for assistance, said Ghosh of NNAF.

The network has more than 80 member organizations that can connect people with financial and logistical resources for abortion access including transportation, accommodation and childcare, according to its website.

And those who want to help others can reach out to established organizations to see what services are needed, Ghosh said.

“We encourage folks to get deeply connected with local abortion funds, ask them what they need in this moment, whether it’s volunteers, providing rides or whether it’s financial support,” Ghosh said.

“I deeply believe there’s a place for everyone in this movement but we have to be strategic and responsive to the needs of the folks who are doing this work on the ground.”

https://www.michigan.gov/ag/news/press-releases/2022/05/24/leader-of-the-base-sentenced,Leader of The Base Sentenced,"LANSING – The leader of The Base – a national white supremacist group that advocates for violence against the government – was sentenced by a Tuscola County court, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced today.

Justen Watkins, 25, of Bad Axe was sentenced to 32 months-4 years for conspiring to train for a civil disorder and a mandatory consecutive 2 years for felony firearm by Judge Amy Gierhart of the Tuscola County Circuit Court. One of the charges filed against Watkins – conspiring to train for a civil disorder – marked the first time a defendant has faced the felony in Michigan’s history.

“The tragic event in Buffalo that resulted in 10 people being murdered and another three injured is an example of why we must prosecute and pursue these types of crimes to deter others from contemplating such acts of violence,” said Nessel. “Securing these convictions on the conspiracy to train for civil disorder creates a historic precedent in our state’s court system and conveys the real danger domestic terrorism poses here and around the country. Today’s sentencing is recognition by the court of the serious nature of these crimes and demonstrates the willingness of our justice system to hold accountable those who commit crimes in the name of overthrowing our government or perpetuating racist ideologies. I appreciate the work of our law enforcement partners at all levels to help bring these criminals to justice.”

The cases resulted from joint investigations by the Michigan State Police (MSP) Caro Post and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF).

BACKGROUND

In October 2020, Justen Watkins was charged in connection to a December 2019 incident in which a Dexter family was terrorized at their home after Watkins used intimidation tactics and posted messages to other members of The Base targeting the home.

Watkins faced the following charges in Washtenaw County in that case:

gang membership, a 20-year felony;

unlawful posting of a message, a two-year felony and/or a $5,000 fine; and using computers to commit a crime, a four-year felony and/or $5,000 fine.

Following the authorization of the Washtenaw County charges, the involved agencies found evidence of Watkins and two other members of The Base – Thomas Denton and Tristan Webb – entering two former and vacant Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) sites in the city of Caro a few weeks prior to the charges being filed.

The men assessed the properties as potential future training grounds for “hate camps”, which is what the group named their paramilitary firearms training exercises.

The charges, co-prosecuted with Tuscola County Prosecutor Mark Reene, were the following in Tuscola County against Watkins:

one count of larceny in a building, a four-year felony;

one count of gang membership, a 20-year felony;

one count of conspiracy to train with firearms for a civil disorder, four-year felony; and

one count of felony firearm, two-year felony.

Founded in 2018, The Base – which is the literal translation of “Al-Qaeda” in English – is a white supremacy gang that openly advocates for violence and criminal acts against the U.S., and purports to be training for a race war to establish white ethnonationalist rule in areas of the U.S., including Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The group also traffics in Nazi ideology and extreme anti-Semitism.

Watkins claims to be the leader of The Base, and reportedly ran a “hate camp” for members of the group, where he led tactical and firearms training for participants with the goal of being prepared for the violent overthrow of the government.

Viral Facebook post: The man who killed the Uvalde, Texas, school shooter 'wasn't even an on-duty police officer.'""

PolitiFact's ruling: False

Here's why: As questions mount over the police response to the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting, some Facebook users are singling out one brave father for taking extraordinary measures at Robb Elementary School — but they’re also botching his story.

""In case anyone missed it, the man that killed the school shooter in Texas wasn't even an on duty officer!!"" one viral Facebook post claimed. ""It was a parent and spouse of a 4th grade teacher, he just happened to be a border patrol agent.""

The post includes photos and links to a recent Newsweek article about Jacob Albarado, an off-duty Border Patrol agent whose wife and daughter were in the school during the attack. At the end of the Facebook post, the author wrote: ""He then evacuated his wife and daughter and went back in and shot the suspect.""

The post gets some details right, but multiple things wrong. According to a report by the New York Times, which the Newsweek article cites, Albarado rushed to the school with a borrowed shotgun and, working with other officers, helped evacuate children.

But neither article said Albarado was the one who shot and killed Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old gunman. Law enforcement credited a tactical team for that, though they haven’t named the people involved.

Albarado appeared on ""Today"" on May 31 and confirmed that he wasn’t on duty and didn’t have any gear but said he helped evacuate children from outside.

We reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Texas Department of Public Safety for comment but did not hear back.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The New York Times included an excerpt about Albarado’s actions in a May 26 story about Uvalde parents who were furious about law enforcement’s delayed response. The Justice Department is reviewing police actions that day.

The story said that Albarado was about to get a haircut when he received a text from his wife, Trisha, a fourth-grade teacher at Robb Elementary, who told him there was an active shooter and asked for help.

Albarado sped to the school with the barber’s shotgun, the story said. Once he arrived, he learned that a tactical team was forming to go inside the wing with the gunman.

""So Mr. Albarado quickly made a plan with other officers at the scene: evacuate as many children as possible,"" the Times reported. ""Two officers provided cover, guns drawn, he said, and two others guided the children out on the sidewalk.""

The story never said Albarado was the one who killed Ramos. On the contrary, it says that a tactical team shot and killed Ramos after breaching the classroom.

But that didn’t stop the social media version of events from taking off.

In another version of the claim, Albarado was ""first in the line of fire"" and cleared every ""wing of the school"" before busting down the door to the room where Ramos was and killing him.

More:Fact-check: How are the firearms for mass shootings purchased?

Albarado appeared on ""Today"" to talk about what happened at the school. He told anchor Savannah Guthrie that he didn’t have any gear and wasn’t on duty, so he didn’t go inside the school.

""I met up with one of the officers there, trying to see what was going on, I tried to make my way toward the door. Like I said, I didn’t have any of my gear, I was off duty, so I didn’t go in,"" Albarado said in the May 31 interview.

As he was helping kids evacuate outside the building, Albarado said his wife contacted him and told him she made it out and that his daughter was across the street at the funeral home.

Albarado said he went to make sure his daughter was safe and then continued to help. He said he didn’t know where Ramos was at the time or whether he was still in the building.

In a May 27 news conference, Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw described how Uvalde police officers, Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement assembled in the hallway of the school, eventually breaching the room where Ramos was located around 12:51 p.m.

""They killed the suspect,"" McCraw said.

Ramos was killed approximately one hour and 20 minutes after he first entered the school.

Our ruling

A Facebook post claims that off-duty Border Patrol agent Jacob Albarado shot and killed the Uvalde school shooter.

This post misrepresents what Albarado and law enforcement have said transpired at the school. While Albarado is a Border Patrol agent who helped with the evacuation effort while off-duty, he said he did not go inside the school. And law enforcement has not indicated he was part of the tactical team that killed Ramos inside the school.

We rate this False.

Man pleads guilty to lesser charge of breaking and entering.,"A Winston-Salem man who claimed he was wrongfully convicted in two murders from the 1980s saw one of those murder convictions overturned Thursday afternoon based on a consent motion from his attorney and the Forsyth County District Attorney’s Office.

Merritt Drayton Williams, 64, has served more than 30 years in prison for the two murder convictions — one from 1985 stemming from a home invasion that led to the death of 65-year-old Blanche Bryson and the other from 1983, where prosecutors allege that 57-year-old Arthur Wilson was beaten to death outside an illegal drink house.

But over the years, questions have been raised about the police investigation in both cases. In June 2019, the N.C. Innocence Inquiry Commission held a hearing in both of the cases and found sufficient evidence that Williams was likely innocent in Bryson’s murder. The commission found new DNA evidence that pointed to a new suspect, Darren Leak Johnson, who confessed to commission investigators and Winston-Salem police that he alone killed Bryson. He is now facing a charge of first-degree murder and is in the Forsyth County Jail, awaiting trial.

During a hearing in December 2021, Johnson said he would not plead guilty, saying it was wrong for Forsyth County prosecutors to keep another man, Williams, in prison for a crime he did not commit.

The commission found insufficient evidence of innocence in the Wilson case. Wilson’s case was the subject of a series of stories in the Winston-Salem Journal that raised questions about the police investigation, including whether Wilson was actually beaten.

A panel of three superior court judges was scheduled to hold a hearing the week of June 27 to determine if Williams should be exonerated in Bryson’s murder. But that hearing has been canceled after Judge Richard Gottlieb of Forsyth Superior Court vacated Williams’ first-degree murder conviction Thursday in the Bryson case.

In return, Williams entered what is known as an Alford plea to felony breaking and entering. An Alford plea meant Williams didn’t admit guilt but was still treated as if he had been convicted. Gottlieb sentenced Williams to three years in prison and gave Williams time served. Williams had been serving two sentences of life in prison but with the possibility of parole, plus 10 years for another conviction of involuntary manslaughter in a third case.

The upshot is that now Williams will only be serving one life sentence for Wilson’s death. He is currently up for parole for that conviction and a decision could come in the next two months.

Williams’ case is unusual. He voluntarily made statements to Winston-Salem police detectives, implicating himself in the two murders, but the statements he made were inconsistent. He had a history of mental illness, and a psychologist who interviewed him said Williams had a personality style that made him more likely to volunteer false confessions, including “impulsivity, insecurity and exaggerated claims about his abilities.”

Michael McCoy, a former assistant police chief, told commission investigators that when he was sergeant over the police department’s homicide division in the 1980s, he told his detectives to be careful about Williams’ statement.

“Mr. McCoy said he cautioned all of his detectives about talking to Mr. Williams and he believed Mr. Williams to be a compulsive liar,” Catherine Matoian, a staff attorney for the N.C. Innocence Inquiry Commission, testified in June 2019, according to a transcript.

Williams told commission investigators that he made up much of what he told police based on what he read in newspaper articles and neighborhood gossip. He also said police pressured him to implicate two men — Sammy Mitchell, who was eventually convicted in Wilson’s death, and Darryl Hunt, who was exonerated in the murder of copy editor Deborah Sykes. Hunt was also convicted of murdering Wilson but was acquitted in a second trial. Additionally, he said police took him to the crime scene before he made any statements.

Winston-Salem police didn’t make any arrests in the Wilson case or the Bryson case until Williams started talking to police.

In court Thursday, Julie Boyer, Williams attorney, said that a few weeks ago, Assistant District Attorney Ben White came to her about a possible resolution. They eventually agreed to file a joint motion for appropriate relief asking a judge to vacate Williams’ first-degree murder conviction in the Bryson case. But Williams still maintains his innocence.

“We would contend that he did not kill Blanche Bryson, and we would also contend that he was not involved,” she said.

White said that on Dec. 10, 1985, Bryson, a 65-year-old woman who had retired as a cafeteria manager at Anderson High School, was killed after she surprised two men robbing her house on Gilmer Avenue, where she lived alone.

According to court documents, she had just arrived home after attending a Christmas party at the Twilight Social Club. She was planning to go home before she went to a wake at Forsyth Funeral Home. Two friends were going to pick her up, but when they got to her place, they saw someone driving Bryson’s orange-and-white Buick Skylark. They could not see who was driving, and the car sped away. One of the friends said he saw someone get into the car on 27th Street.

Jeffrey Bryson, her son, would later find his mother sprawled on the living room floor, a lamp chord wrapped around her neck. The house was ransacked, and police found her car less than a mile away on 21sth and Ivy streets.

Williams started talking to police about the Bryson case on April 18, 1986, after he was already in jail on a charge that he pushed a woman named Mary Smith down the stairs, resulting in her death a few weeks later (Williams would later plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter in that case and has not claimed innocence in Smith’s death). Williams initially told police that he and other men broke into Bryson’s house and that he was wearing two toboggans, one of which he gave to a man named Sammy Mitchell, a friend of the late Darryl Hunt, who was exonerated in 2004 in the death of Deborah Sykes. Sykes was a copy editor at the afternoon newspaper, The Sentinel. New DNA evidence led to a different man, who confessed to raping and killing Sykes.

Williams told police he also took two lampshades in the house.

But within a week, Williams’ story changed, with him saying he lied about the lampshades and that the men, including Mitchell, were not involved. Police had compared the men’s fingerprints with those lifted at the crime scene, and there had been no match. He then told police that a man he called “Lou” or “Lieutenant” was the one who killed Bryson.

After a jury convicted him of first-degree murder and he was sentenced, Williams changed his story again, saying that another man he called Gregory Thompson was an accomplice. Warren Sparrow, the district attorney, told reporters that he didn’t know if Thompson even existed.

Winston-Salem police never arrested any of the men Williams named as accomplices. A year after Williams’ conviction in 1987 in the Bryson case, Robbin Carmichael came forward after he was arrested on unrelated charges. He confessed to his role in Bryson’s murder and turned over three pouches of costume jewelry that were stolen from Bryson’s house. His fingerprints were found on Bryson’s car.

It was through Carmichael that Johnson’s name first came up as a suspect in Bryson’s murder. But when Ken Bishop, a Winston-Salem police detective, interviewed him, Johnson denied he was involved. Carmichael pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. He got out of prison in 2008 and his parole ended in 2013. He told commission investigators that at the time of Bryson’s murder, he did not know Williams.

Williams filed claims with the N.C. Innocence Inquiry Commission, and as the commission investigators looked into the case, they found Johnson’s name in the police reports. They tracked down Johnson in South Carolina, where they went to get a DNA sample. During that meeting, Johnson “indicated that he needed to get right with God and told Attorney (Catherine) Matoian (the staff attorney with the commission) that he was responsible for the murder of Blanche Bryson.”

Johnson told investigators that Williams was not there when he killed Bryson. DNA taken from Johnson was compared to DNA from Bryson’s nail clippings. They matched, and in June 2019, Johnson was arrested and charged with Bryson’s murder.

However, Forsyth County prosecutors still insisted that in both the Wilson case and the Bryson case, Williams’ statements were corroborated by physical evidence found at the crime scene. They also argued that Williams made many of those statements in court while under oath. Specifically, in Bryson’s case, they argued that Johnson and Williams could have acted in concert to break into Bryson’s house and that Bryson had admitted he was high on LSD at the time of the crime, meaning it is possible that Williams was there and that Johnson couldn’t remember.

The only physical evidence that police said corroborated Williams’ statements were two strands of hair from one of the toboggans that a hair analyst said could have come from Williams. But hair structure isn’t enough to definitively say that it was Williams’ hair.

Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill has also criticized the innocence commission’s work. He said he hoped that “this case and this defendant, who qualifies under the FBI definition of a serial killer, will serve as perhaps the most egregious example as to why the legislature must act now and review the state-funded Innocence Commission and their free-wheeling expenditure of taxpayer dollars.”

The innocence commission, which started operating in 2007, has reviewed more than 3,200 cases. There have been 15 exonerations, either through a three-judge panel hearing or some other method, according to the commission’s website.",Q2
https://theweek.com/briefing/1014651/what-happens-without-roe-v-wade,What happens now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned?,"The Supreme Court on Friday voted 6-3 to overturn federal abortion rights as protected under 1973's landmark Roe v. Wade decision, bringing an end to nearly 50 years of precedent. Despite being somewhat expected, as per a draft majority opinion leaked back in May, the ruling immediately sparked a widespread firestorm of both celebration and condemnation. But what exactly happens now? Here's everything you need to know:

Back up — what did the opinion say?

The specific case before the court — Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization — pertained to a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, much earlier than the fetal viability threshold established by Roe. In siding with Mississippi on Friday, writes The Wall Street Journal, the court's six conservative members deemed the Roe decision to be ""egregiously wrong"" and ""an error the court perpetuated in the decades since.""

""We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,"" the majority wrote in its opinion, referencing 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which was also struck down. ""The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision … Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.""

""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives,"" they added.

Dissenting Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Stephen Breyer just as potently rejected the majority's position. ""With sorrow — for this court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection,"" the court's liberals wrote in their joint opinion: ""We dissent.""

Is abortion now illegal everywhere?

Not necessarily. In overruling Roe, the court has sent the issue of abortion back to the states, where its legality will be decided on an individual basis. Some states, like New York and California, have already codified the right to an abortion into law, and will be therefore largely unaffected by Friday's decision. But others, like South Dakota, Louisiana, and Kentucky, have laws that now immediately ban the procedure in Roe's absence. The same goes for Oklahoma and Texas. All make exceptions for the life of the mother.

Elsewhere, in Idaho, Utah, North Dakota, Wyoming, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi, these so-called ""trigger bans"" — laws designed to come into play should Roe disappear — will take effect after 30 days, and/or after a state official certifies the court's decision.

But in states without trigger bans — like Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina — laws that forbid most or all abortions are likely to go into effect in the near future, The Washington Post notes. And in states like Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Virginia, the fate of reproductive rights ""will depend on the upcoming midterms.""

How has the pro-life movement responded?

Anti-abortion groups have thus far praised the court's decision. At this weekend's National Right to Life Convention, for example, attendees hugged one another and grew emotional upon hearing the news.

""We are all excited,"" Carol Tobias, the committee's president, told CNN. ""Of course, everybody here is erupting in tears of joy that this has finally happened. We are going to be celebrating for the rest of the weekend.""

Still, she said, ""We have a long battle ahead of us. Abortion is not going to be illegal because of this decision. … We certainly know this is not the end.""

""I can barely talk,"" added Lynda Bell, chair of the board of NRLC, as well as the president of Florida Right to Life. ""We have waited for this for 49 years, and finally, the court has recognized their egregious decision that stripped the states of the ability to protect life.""

Meanwhile, a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. As abortion rights protesters mourned, pro-life demonstrators applauded the decision and ""danced to celebratory music,"" reports The New York Times.

What about the pro-choice movement?

Abortion rights supporters outside the court on Friday reacted with ""despair and outrage,"" the Post reports. Some said they intended to defy efforts to restrict abortion, even in states where it could become illegal, the Times adds.

""To anyone today who is scared, or angry, or determined, know this — 17 million Planned Parenthood supporters proudly stand with you,"" Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement on Friday. ""We will rebuild and reclaim the freedom that is ours. We won't go back. And we won't back down.""

And though President Biden harbors somewhat conflicted feelings regarding abortion, he nonetheless denounced the court's decision during a speech on Friday, calling the ruling a ""tragic error.""

Might other decisions now be overturned?

Justice Clarence Thomas suggested in a concurring opinion that perhaps the court should revisit several other consequential cases — like those pertaining to same-sex marriage and contraception — now that Roe has been successfully overturned.

""In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,"" Thomas argued. 1965's Griswold v. Connecticut established a married couple's constitutional right to contraceptives, while 2003's Lawrence v. Texas ruled states may not ban sodomy. 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges protected same-sex marriage as a constitutional right.

Will there be legal ramifications?

The court's decision is about to cause ""legal chaos"" nationwide, Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told NPR. ""I think what we will see is far more litigation in the federal courts – not less litigation.""

Greer Donley, a law professor specializing in reproductive health care, agreed: ""It's going to be a real nightmare,"" she told Politico, warning that a clear legal picture is only likely to emerge once a few months have passed.

Litigaton may also unfold in state courts where local constitutions perhaps offer ""protections for abortion rights notwithstanding the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution,"" NPR writes. And that's all without mentioning the murky issue of bans and their legal ramifications bleeding over from one state to another.

""This just raises a whole host of issues,"" Rikelman said, to NPR. ""All of those different disputes will have to be worked out in the courts"" — even perhaps the Supreme Court.

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fifth-circuit-affirms-dismissal-of-adea-5312190/,Fifth Circuit Affirms Dismissal of ADEA Claim Lacking Evidence of Age-Bias,"On March 11, 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment, dismissing a Texas city employee’s claim that he had been unlawfully terminated from his job because of his age. The Fifth Circuit held that age discrimination comments must contain age-specific references, and a factfinder cannot infer age discrimination without clear evidence of age bias.

Brief Background

In Harris v. City of Schertz, No. 20-50795 (5th Cir. March 11, 2022), Michael Harris (“Harris”) brought suit against his former employer the City of Schertz, Texas (“the City” or “City”). Harris was employed as City Marshall who supervised the City’s Animal Services Department as part of his duties for approximately three years. In December 2016, a manager complained to Harris about the behavior of another employee, and Harris relayed the information to senior authorities. The City opened an investigation and discovered Harris had been present and even participatory when sexually and racially inappropriate language was used in the workplace. The City demoted Harris for his alleged involvement in fostering an inappropriate work environment. Two months later, the City terminated Harris for allegedly placing a concealed camera at the City’s Animal Services Department.

Harris filed suit in the Western District of Texas alleging unlawful discrimination on account of his sex, in violation of Title VII, and age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”). The district court found Harris established he was discharged because of his age, relying on his superior’s testimony that Harris “had not been adequately prepared or mentored” or “taught to be a leader”, and that Harris “struggled to engage and to learn more” despite the City needing a manager with a higher level of sophistication and leadership than Harris. The district court rejected the City’s offered reason for Harris’ termination – that they intended to demote Harris for the work environment at the City’s Animal Services Department and the discovery of the hidden camera – because it was unclear if Harris had actually ordered the camera to be hidden. Notwithstanding, the district court ultimately dismissed Harris’ sex and age discrimination claims by granting the City’s summary judgment because he (1) failed to provide evidence that a similarly situated employee outside of his protected class was treated more favorably to establish sex discrimination, and (2) failed to prove “but-for” causation between his age and the termination to establish age discrimination. Harris only appealed the district court’s dismissal of his age-based discrimination claim.

Fifth Circuit’s Decision

The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment in favor of the City, including dismissal of Harris’ age discrimination claim. Concluding the testimony about Harris’ performance did not contain sufficient age-specific bias for a factfinder to infer Harris was terminated because of his age, the Fifth Circuit agreed that Harris’ termination did not amount to age discrimination. Harris argued the testimony that he was largely unqualified for the responsibilities of his position would allow a factfinder to infer that Harris was terminated because he was “old and slow.” The Fifth Circuit disagreed, stating “[s]uch an inference would be pure speculation.” Citing their own precedent, the Fifth Circuit concluded that when a decision-maker’s comments are “sufficiently suggestive of age bias”, the comments contain more age-specific references than the testimony about Harris’ leadership deficiencies, citing examples like referring to a plaintiff as an “old fart” or “old goat”, or describing his appearance as “old man clothes.” Thus, the Fifth Circuit held that a reasonable factfinder would not be justified to infer that Harris was terminated because of his age.

Key Takeaways

The Fifth Circuit confirmed that a factfinder must have evidence of age-specific bias, not mere inferences, in order to permit an age discrimination claim to survive dismissal. Thus, an employer’s decision to terminate an employee for poor performance will not be usurped by an age discrimination claim if there is an absence of age-specific bias by the decision-maker.

Greg Abbott confirmed to NBC 5 Thursday that the governor would no longer be attending the event on Friday, but will be addressing the convention by taped video.

Just days after the deadliest school shooting in Texas history, Gov. Greg Abbott, along with both of Texas' U.S. senators, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas 2nd District), was scheduled to attend the National Rifle Association's annual convention in Houston.

Nineteen children and two teachers were killed after an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday.

The shooter was carrying a handgun and possibly a rifle, according to Abbott.

""He shot and killed, horrifically, incomprehensibly, 14 students and killed a teacher,"" Abbott said, in comments before the death toll rose.

It is unclear if the gunman is among those numbers, although he was confirmed to have been killed by police.

The Uvalde school shooting happened four years after a gunman fatally shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area back in 2018.

NBC 5 reached out to Abbott, Cornyn, Cruz and Crenshaw to find out if each of them is still planning to keep their speaking engagements Friday at the NRA convention, where they are supposed to join former President Donald Trump.

A representative from Cornyn's office replied: ""Prior to the tragedy today in Uvalde we had already informed the NRA he would not be able to speak due to an unexpected change in his schedule. He now has to be in D.C. for personal reasons on Friday.""

A spokesperson for Crenshaw said he will not be attending the convention because he will be in Ukraine. Like Cornyn, Crenshaw's team said they informed the NRA of the schedule change on Tuesday before the massacre.

When asked about it Wednesday, Abbott said ""I am living moment to moment right now, my heart, my head and my body are in Uvalde right now.""

So far, we haven't received a response from Cruz.

The NRA released a statement Wednesday offering ""deepest sympathies.""

Trump wrote on social media Wednesday that he will keep his ""longtime commitment to speak in Texas at the NRA Convention.""

According to the NRA's website, Trump will headline a ""star-studded cast of political heavyweights"" in a ""celebration of Second Amendment rights.""

""NRA members are excited to hear him speak and thank him for his support for our right to keep and bear arms,"" said NRA Executive Vice President & CEO Wayne LaPierre.

https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/mark-brnovich-arizona-senate-republican-primary/,Is Mark Brnovich conservative enough for Arizona?,"Is Mark Brnovich conservative enough for Arizona?

Mark Brnovich, the attorney general of Arizona and a leading Republican candidate for Senate, boasts the sort of establishment credentials and prominent statewide profile that have given him a running start as he competes in one of the most high-profile races of the midterm elections.

His studded résumé, in contrast with an array of lesser-known GOP rivals, suggests some continuity with an individualist style of Republican politics that, while often idealized, has long been venerated in the historically conservative Copper State. As a college freshman, for instance, Brnovich interned with the self-proclaimed maverick John McCain, who was then a congressman, and later directed the Goldwater Institute’s Center for Constitutional Government, whose namesake, the former senator and McCain predecessor Barry Goldwater, is a founder of modern conservatism.

Brnovich, an experienced prosecutor who leans libertarian, casts himself as a party faithful who, as the state’s top law enforcement official, is also charting a solo path in the spirit of his personal heroes, including Robert F. Kennedy, Muhammad Ali and Jerry Garcia, the revered frontman of his favorite band, the Grateful Dead.

“It’s a long, strange trip,” Brnovich, 55, quipped in a recent interview with Jewish Insider, invoking a popular line from “Truckin,” the shuffling Grateful Dead classic.

Lately, though, Brnovich — whose gravelly voice and scruffy beard contribute somewhat to his image as an avowed Deadhead — appears to have found himself adrift as former President Donald Trump has asserted his psychedelic spell over Arizona’s warped political landscape. Brnovich, who launched his campaign last June, has struggled to balance his messaging with appeals to Trump’s base, which remains in thrall to the former president’s unfounded attacks on the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

Brnovich might as well have committed political apostasy when he acknowledged that Joe Biden had won the election and sat alongside Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, as she certified the results in November 2020. More recently, the two-term attorney general has somewhat conspicuously dragged his feet on an investigation connected with the findings of a partisan election audit, commissioned by the Republican-controlled state Senate, that reaffirmed Biden’s victory.

Weeks before announcing his run, Brnovich took fire from the former president, who dismissed him as “lackluster” in a blistering statement. “He is always on television promoting himself,” Trump said last May, “but never mentions the Crime of the Century, that took place during the 2020 Presidential Election, which was Rigged and Stolen.” While the former president appears to have softened his rhetoric in recent months — having described the Senate hopeful as a “good man” at a rally in Arizona last January — Trump has also emphasized that he is “anxiously waiting” for Brnovich to declare that the election was a “total fraud.”

Uncharacteristically for the often disputatious attorney general, Brnovich has shied away from addressing such tensions, arguing instead that he has been out front on election issues for longer than his opponents, who have faced little to no resistance from the former president. The attorney general, who includes a section about “restoring election integrity” on the issues page of his campaign website, cited a consequential Supreme Court case last summer in which he successfully defended some voting restrictions in Arizona that critics had accused of discrimination against minorities. “I stepped up, not my opponents,” Brnovich said. “They didn’t file briefs. That was me.”

Even as Brnovich touts his decidedly hardline approach, one of his chief Republican rivals, Blake Masters, has more willingly pandered to Trump’s election lies. The well-funded venture capitalist has falsely declared that “Trump won in 2020,” and in an interview with JI not long ago, described Brnovich as “weak on election integrity.” Meanwhile, a pro-Masters super PAC — buoyed by a $10 million donation from his former boss, the right-wing tech billionaire Peter Thiel — has released attack ads targeting Brnovich over his alleged disloyalty to the former president.

The other GOP candidates in the August primary include Jim Lamon, a solar executive who has used a personal loan of at least $13 million to cut one of the more incendiary TV ads of the current election cycle; Michael McGuire, a former adjutant general of the Arizona National Guard; and Justin Olson, a state utility regulator who recently served as the chief financial officer of Turning Point USA, a Trump-aligned campus advocacy group.

The former president has so far withheld his endorsement, despite attending a fundraiser for Masters last November. In conversation with JI, Brnovich was reluctant to dwell on Trump’s thought process, sounding mildly exasperated when the subject was raised. “I don’t know what the president or anyone else is going to do,” he said. “But I learned a long time ago in my career that if you want to talk about me and what I believe and why I believe it, I will talk to you about it and I will tell you.”

With five months remaining until the primary, the field remains mutable, even more so now that Arizona’s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, has finally removed himself from contention. The term-limited governor had resisted entreaties from GOP leadership in Washington who believed he was the party’s best shot to unseat Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), the vulnerable Democratic incumbent.

Brnovich said he respects “the job” Ducey “is doing” but declined to comment on any conversations about the race he has had with the governor, who has also drawn rebukes from Trump for affirming the presidential election results. Ducey’s exit was no doubt fortuitous for a relatively mainstream candidate like Brnovich, who has led public polling on the race, even as most voters say they are still undecided. But his surprisingly sluggish fundraising has, up to this point, proven incommensurate with his prestige status as a well-known elected official, fueling speculation over his viability.

According to the latest filings from the Federal Election Commission, Brnovich has raised just over $1.8 million, but entered the new year with only $770,000 on hand. He has been far outpaced by Lamon, who said he will ultimately spend $50 million of his own money, as well as Masters, who was sitting on $1.8 million as of Dec. 31. On Friday, Masters announced that his campaign had pulled in $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2022.

A spokesperson for the Brnovich campaign declined to disclose his latest fundraising numbers before the filing deadline on April 15.

While Brnovich entered the primary as a “soft frontrunner based on name ID and the fact that he had been elected statewide,” said Jessica Taylor, a Senate elections forecaster for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, “what he hasn’t been able to do is capitalize on that.” The attorney general is “just not running an impressive campaign by any means,” she told JI. “Unless he is able to match financial mettle,” Taylor added, “he could very well lose.”

For the moment, Kelly, a former astronaut who is seeking his first full term after unseating a Republican incumbent in 2020, maintains a comfortable cash advantage, having finished the year with approximately $19 million on hand. But the general election matchup, which Cook rates a toss-up, is widely expected to be competitive, due in part to seemingly favorable political headwinds for Republicans gunning to regain their majority in the upper chamber.

Ron Ober, a political consultant in Phoenix who supports Kelly and has worked closely with his campaign, believes the senator will be tough to beat, but he expressed uncertainty as to who among his Republican challengers would advance beyond the primary. “It’s unclear if Masters or Lamon can level the playing field with just money,” Ober told JI. “The conventional wisdom says that Brnovich has the advantage until he doesn’t.”

In the interview with JI, Brnovich was sanguine about his prospects. “Fortunately, no one has to guess where I stand because I’ve been involved in every single major fight in not only Arizona but this country over the last seven years,” he said. “When you look at law and order, someone that’s actually been toe-to-toe with the cartels and gangbangers, when you look at someone that literally lives in the same neighborhood they grew up in and cares about the price of gas and the price of groceries — I am a consistent rule-of-law Republican, and I think that’s what Arizonans want.”

Thomas J. Volgy, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said Brnovich “has been actively using his position as attorney general with a series of high-profile lawsuits to challenge Democratic policies and to enshrine his very conservative credentials.”

But it has been “hard to tell” how Brnovich is distinguishing himself ideologically from his primary challengers, according to Volgy. “All have tilted very far to the right in order to contest for conservative Republican votes,” he told JI in a recent email exchange. “In fact, given the short time between the primary and the general election, this tilt becomes a very significant liability both for Brnovich and his competitors.”

Echoing some of the red-meat conservative talking points that are now circulating in the race, Brnovich says he is running to address such issues as border security, federal government overreach, “attempts to socialize our economy” and policies that, he argues, “make us dependent on our energy needs from tyrants and dictators all over the world.”

Despite overlap with his opponents, Brnovich insisted that he is the only true believer in the race. “Arizonans deserve a senator that represents Arizona values, not somebody that’s trying to buy a Senate seat to fuel their own ego,“ Brnovich, who lives in Phoenix and is the son of ethnic Serbian immigrants from the former Yugoslavia, told JI. “I am somebody whose family has not just studied history, but lived it. My parents lived through World War II, they lived through communism, and I think anytime when you have that kind of background, you understand how important freedom is and how fragile liberty is.”

On foreign policy matters, particularly in the Middle East, Brnovich drew a contrast with Masters, whose non-interventionist approach has raised questions among Jewish community activists who have voiced concern that such views could influence his position on maintaining U.S. security assistance for Israel. Masters, for his part, has clarified that he is in favor of providing aid to Israel, while emphasizing a broader skepticism of funding for other countries.

Brnovich, however, cast doubt on the authenticity of that explanation. “I think it’s easy for someone who’s dropped into a Senate race that’s being supported by an out-of-state billionaire,” he told JI, “to say one thing and when they’re in front of another group or another show or on radio or TV, they’re saying something completely different.”

Describing himself as an “unabashed supporter of Israel” for his “entire life,” Brnovich said he is “wholeheartedly” in favor of continued U.S. security funding as well as supplemental assistance for Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system. Israel, he said, “is literally at the tip of the spear, and so anything that we do to help Israel helps the United States.”

Brnovich drew a parallel with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which he described as a “reprehensible attack,” to illustrate his support for security funding. “Folks need to understand that there are people out there that don’t respect international borders and mean us harm,” he said. “It’s important to have a good offense.”

In the fall of 2018, Brnovich visited Israel — “at no taxpayer expense,” he hastened to clarify — for the second time since he assumed office. During the trip, he attended a financial technology conference in Tel Aviv and, with help from the Jewish National Fund, visited the city of Sderot near the border with Gaza, an experience he characterized as instructive. “I understand the threats to Israel’s existence are very, very real,” said Brnovich, recalling that he had toured a JNF-sponsored indoor recreation center designed to protect against rocket attacks from Hamas. “I’ve seen it firsthand.”

Looking elsewhere in the region, Brnovich endorsed legislation aimed at strengthening and expanding the Abraham Accords, which normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and a number of Arab nations in a series of historic agreements brokered by the Trump administration.

Brnovich opposes the Biden administration’s ongoing efforts to renegotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran, suggesting that the deal would jeopardize Israel’s security as well as broader stability in the Middle East. He argued for imposing economic sanctions that, he believes, will restrict Iran’s ability to create a nuclear weapon, and indicated that he is in favor of a range of diplomatic options, but did not provide specifics.

While he has no professional experience in the foreign policy realm, Brnovich touted his legal efforts to counter the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel. In Arizona, he said he has upheld a state law that prohibits government-funded contractors from boycotting the Jewish state. He has also taken the fight to the national level. Last year, for instance, Brnovich joined a multi-state coalition defending anti-BDS legislation in Arkansas that was found to have been in violation of the First Amendment. Brnovich, however, rejects the argument that such bills are unconstitutional, arguing instead that boycotts of Israel are potentially engaging in what he describes as “country-of-origin discrimination.”

Brnovich has suggested that the BDS movement is motivated by anti-Jewish prejudice and amounts to “economic warfare” against Israel. “It seems like there’s a lot more hatred, there’s a lot more anger in this country and the world, and historically, when there are economic tensions, you get different ethnic groups scapegoated,” he mused. “We do have an obligation,” he added, “to stand up and call out” instances of “overt or even subtle antisemitism” wherever they occur.

In his own state, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle recently censured Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers in a rare bipartisan vote, condemning social media comments in which she had espoused antisemitic conspiracy theories and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “globalist puppet” after speaking at a white nationalist conference hosted by a prominent Holocaust denier.

Brnovich, who commended the vote, emphasized that the legislature “is its own body” and that he respects “the separation of powers” between his office and the state Senate. “I think that was a very strong message,” he explained, “and an indication that anyone that coddles up to anyone engaging in any sort of antisemitic rhetoric, we have no tolerance or place for that in Arizona.”

In February, Brnovich was named in a lawsuit challenging the potential use of hydrogen cyanide — otherwise known as Zyklon B, the lethal gas found at Auschwitz — in executions of death row inmates in Arizona. Filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona on behalf of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Phoenix, the suit argues that hydrogen cyanide is a form of “cruel and unusual punishment” that violates the state constitution.

Asked to address the lawsuit, Brnovich said “we need to keep in context why we have the death penalty,” adding: “Just like Adolf Eichmann deserved to be killed and the other Nazis that perpetuated crimes against humanity deserved” punishment, “I think society has a right to defend itself, and that includes executing those who commit unspeakable crimes.”

Tim Eckstein, who chairs the JCRC’s board in Phoenix, argued that Brnovich and his co-defendants have failed to address the substance of the suit, which does not call for the abolishment of the death penalty. “They’re not engaging on the core issue we’ve raised,” he said.

Brnovich, who has filed a motion to have the suit dismissed, said he could not comment directly on ongoing litigation. “I’m really kind of limited in getting into the weeds with the details of the different kinds of chemicals and drugs and the proposals,” he said. “We do the legal arguments, but it’s ultimately the Department of Corrections that comes up with the method.”

Eckstein does not believe the lawsuit has created tension between Brnovich and Jewish community leaders in Arizona who object to hydrogen cyanide. “He did not create this issue,” Eckstein told JI.

The same, of course, might be said of his strained relationship with Trump.

Brnovich, who previously worked as a lobbyist for the Corrections Corporation of America, has held prosecutorial positions at the state and federal levels. He has also served as the director of Arizona’s Department of Gaming and as a command staff judge advocate in the U.S. Army National Guard.

In his quest to claim the seat once occupied by his old boss, John McCain, Brnovich said he recognized that there were challenges ahead, even as he expressed confidence that he would prevail.

“I know there’s a lot of folks and there’s a lot of special interest and out-of-state money trying to influence this race,” Brnovich said. “When you’re a public school kid with a funny last name, you learn early on that you’ve just got to be a straight shooter, you’ve got to work hard, and you’ve got to be tough,” he emphasized. “You’ve got to be able to take a punch and give a punch.”

It was unclear, though, if he was including the former president in that assessment.",Q2

James R. Baldwin, a Winsted man from a family of clockmakers, died at the battle of Cold Harbor in Virginia on June 1, 1864. His blue, woolen pants are the latest acquisition of the recently renovated museum, which is dedicated to detailing Connecticut’s role in the War of the Great Rebellion.

“This represents what the museum is all about,” curator Dan Hayden said. “We’re trying to bring out the stories and the humanity of the regular people of the Civil War era.”

The pants are in a custom-made case and will be on display along with other exhibits this weekend. Museum hours are Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 3 p.m.

A Baldwin descendant learned about the museum from an article in The Courant last year and decided to donate the long-stored trousers, Hayden said. Baldwin likely left the pants and other possessions behind when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered artillery units away from the defenses of Washington, D.C., and sent them southward as badly needed infantry.

The unit actually started the war as the 19th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, comprising mostly men from Litchfield County. They were recruited in 1861 and at first saw mostly garrison duty in Washington. Their designation was changed to artillery in November 1863 and they left the defenses of Washington early in 1864.

By that time, Yankee strategy was progressing rapidly from the bumbling, hesitant campaigns of George McClellan and Ambrose Burnside to Grant’s unrelenting war of attrition.

Baldwin was killed in the first wave of an attack on a Confederate breastworks. This was on the first day of the battle, not the much lamented slaughter on June 3 that Grant would forever regret. Nevertheless, the “2nd Heavies” suffered 23% losses at Cold Harbor, their first major battle, with more than 300 men killed, wounded and missing.

Baldwin’s body was never identified. He was buried along with other soldiers on the battlefield, and the remains were later moved to Cold Harbor National Cemetery, Hayden said.

The 2nd Connecticut went on to fight at Hatcher’s Run in February 1865, in Petersburg from March 25 through April 2 and at Sailor’s Creek in April 1865, just before Gen. Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House. Of the 2,700 men who served in the unit, 143 were killed in action, 80 died of wounds and 186 died of disease.

Baldwin’s trousers bear red lines down each trouser leg, signifying artillery, and the thickness of the lines shows they belonged to a corporal. The pants are in “remarkable shape,” Baldwin said.

“It’s not just a pair of pants,” he said. “There’s sweat stains on them — the humanity that emanates from these things … I’m holding back tears.”

The museum — https://www.newenglandcivilwarmuseum.com/ — is on the second floor of the town’s Memorial Building, 14 Park Place.

Hayden has previously noted that the museum is for “Civil War historians, history buffs and anyone else fascinated by the stories of the farmers, factory workers, craftsmen and other everyday people who went off to war as citizen soldiers during perhaps the most extraordinary time in American history.”

The museum space, part of the town hall building finished in 1890, originally was the meeting place of the local GAR, Thomas F. Burpee Post 71.

A trespasser approached the campus and stabbed a student.

Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter . It’s Wednesday, April 20. I’m Justin Ray.

A teen in Stockton died after being stabbed to death Monday by a man in what police described as a random attack, authorities said. National news outlets have covered the tragedy in the city located almost 50 miles south of Sacramento.

Investigators said the man, who was identified as Anthony Gray, 52, drove to Stagg High School’s front parking lot, exited his car, walked up to the student — Alycia Reynaga , 15, as confirmed to The Times by the San Joaquin County Medical Examiner & Coroner — and stabbed her.

Stockton Unified School District Supt. John Ramirez Jr. said during a news conference that Gray walked through an unlocked gate at the front of the campus. Several school staff members were near the gate when the stabbing occurred, including a district police officer, he said.

District spokesperson Melinda Meza said Gray had tried to grab two female students, according to the Stockton Record . She added that there is no known connection between Gray and Reynaga. The campus was placed on lockdown after the attack.

“It has been a sad day at SUSD,” the district wrote in a Facebook post . “There will be School Counselors, Mental Health Clinicians and School Psychologists available at Stagg all week and as needed. There will also be extra security on campus.”

Gray, 52, who is from Stockton, is scheduled to appear in court at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday for arraignment on a murder felony charge, according to the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s inmate database. He was detained without bail.

Parents told ABC 10 that Reynaga was one of the high school softball team’s star players.

Officers and Stagg staffers were seen patrolling the school’s parking lots and entrances as students arrived for class Tuesday morning, according to the Record.

“My heart is shattered by the violence that ended the life of a young student today,” Stockton Mayor Kevin J. Lincoln said in a statement . “My deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victim. No child should ever have to experience or witness such senseless acts of violence.”

The Stockton Police Department told KCRA in February that the city had seen a “very concerning and unacceptable” spike in homicides in 2022.

Nelson Releases Powerful New Memoir About Practicing Radical Self-Care Amid Trauma, Covid, and Our Turbulent Times","""Be the One You Need: 21 Life Lessons I Learned While Taking Care of Everyone but Me"" from Health Communications, Inc. is Just the Book We All Need in These Challenging and Isolating Times in Which We Live

WASHINGTON, June 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Americans are in a mental and emotional health crisis, which has turned into a self-care crisis. It's affecting us all: the young, men, women, middle-aged and older Americans, as well as all racial ethnic groups. Data trends show Americans experiencing more depression, isolation, bullying and worry amidst daily traumas in the form of political division, racial division, school shootings, and grocery store massacres. Now even hospitals and medical doctors are targets. All of this, on top of the more than one million deaths due to COVID-19, has made the focus on mental health and self-care more vital than before.

CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED BESTSELLING INSPIRATIONAL AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST SOPHIA A. NELSON Be the One You Need

The question we are all asking is: how do I take care of my mental health and wellness in the middle of all of this trouble?

Author Sophia Nelson has some answers. In her 4th book, ""Be the One You Need: 21 Life Lessons I Learned While Taking Care of Everyone but Me,"" Nelson becomes the narrator for our healing. She gives us raw, real and downright empowering practical inspirations from her own life story. Inspired by Nelson's own serious battle with COVID-19, this book could not be more timely to help us practice the art of meaningful self-care. This book is not like other self-help books that just scratch the surface.

This book is a perfectly timed summer inspirational read that will help readers unlock the door to deeper, more meaningful self-care. Nelson wrote the book after having COVID-19 twice, once before vaccines were available and again after getting fully vaccinated. Nelson, like many of us, had to face her own mortality. She knew that she had to make a change in order to live a more fulfilling life.

That change starts with three questions she dares us to ask ourselves often:

1.) What do I want?

2.) What do I need?

3.) How am I feeling?

The change that comes from doing the work on you first and taking care of you first is life-changing, healing, and empowering. It requires us to take a deeper dive into facing our past hurts and traumas. From there, learning to set healthy personal and professional boundaries and doing the work of healing from family, relationship, and environmental trauma is paramount. ""My hope with this important and deeply personal book is to help give younger women and men the tools those in my generation (GenX) did not have,"" said Nelson. ""I have lived. I know some things to be true. And COVID changed the way I take care of myself with my family and set healthy boundaries.""

Through the lessons she has learned, Nelson helps us rebuild and recalibrate how we practice self-awareness, follow our intuition, and maintain healthy, mutually beneficial relationships.

Here's a snapshot of some of the life lessons discussed:

You are not your family's traumatic history

Take care of your mental and emotional health first

Stop being the go-to for people you can't go to

Don't cancel and publicly shame people

Know the things you need to leave behind in order to move ahead

Reframe your thoughts: Build an EIQ toolkit

Manage expectations of yourself and others

In ""Be the One You Need,"" Nelson provides 21 life lessons that emphasize the importance of putting yourself at the front of the ""care"" line. Endorsed by some of the most influential people in the world, including New York Times bestselling author and Hollywood producer DeVon Franklin; bestselling author, founder of Know Your Value, co-host of Morning Joe, Mika Brzezinski; and CEO the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Dr. Bernice King, this book is one of the most highly anticipated reads of the summer of 2022. Hollywood producer and New York Times bestselling author DeVon Franklin sums this powerful book up best.

""I found 'Be the One You Need' to be a powerful and soul-stirring book that carefully and thoughtfully helps us learn how to service ourselves so we can be of even better service to others,"" said DeVon Franklin. ""This is a must-read for everyone, especially those looking to live a life of true freedom and greater peace.""

https://www.algemeiner.com/2022/04/02/violence-against-diaspora-jews-is-not-israels-fault/,Violence Against Diaspora Jews Is Not Israel’s Fault,"JNS.org – After three Arab terror attacks in a week that cost 11 lives, Israel’s government and citizens are in a heightened state of alert and worrying about the possibility of a series of individual attacks turning into a third intifada. But security officials spared a moment amid their mobilization to ramp up efforts to combat terror on the streets of Israel’s cities with another concern. According to Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, the country’s leaders were also considering the possibility that Diaspora Jews might also be targeted by Palestinian radicals and/or their foreign sympathizers.

Kochavi was quoted by Israel’s Channel 13 television saying, “There is a real concern that the copycat effect could lead to efforts to hit Israeli and Jewish targets around the world.” He didn’t elaborate on this potential threat, though the report said that Israeli security agencies, including the Mossad, were going to need to step up attempts to combat such terror outside of the Jewish state.

If Kochavi is right, it will likely set off a renewed debate among some on the Jewish left about who will really be to blame for attacks on American Jews. Inevitably, some will say the fault lies with Israel for policies that its critics often claim make a terrorist response from oppressed Palestinians inevitable.

That’s the line we’ll likely hear from anti-Zionist groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow, who themselves often traffic in antisemitism. After all, they already think that Israel is to blame for everything that’s wrong in the Middle East and elsewhere. Such fallacies will also likely be echoed to some degree by liberal Zionists who ignore Palestinian intransigence and believe that Israel must be saved from itself. Such people think the refusal of Israelis to adopt suicidal policies that American Jews recommend will lead to disaster for everyone.

This is deeply wrong for a number of reasons.

The first is that it reflects the internalization of antisemitism by Jews, many of whom have always reacted to hatred against them by seeing it as a product of their own behavior or mistakes. The truth is that antisemitism is always about the antisemites, not what the Jews think or do. Jews are hated for a variety of often-contradictory reasons, and those who seek to find the cure for it within themselves are always looking in the wrong place.

This attitude also reflects a certain blindness about the way radical Islamists and their left-wing allies have created a belief system that doesn’t so much excuse antisemitism as provide it with a rationale.

While Israelis have been the primary targets of terrorists looking to kill Jews, Jews elsewhere have also frequently been targeted. A rising tide of antisemitism fueled by the impact of massive immigration from the Middle East and North Africa, coupled with leftist bias against Israel, has made it dangerous to walk freely on the streets of major Western European cities while wearing jewelry or clothing that identifies a person as Jewish.

Just last year, Israel’s 11-day conflict with Hamas in Gaza, during which the terror group fired more than 4,000 rockets and missiles into Israel, also led to acts of anti-Jewish violence on the streets of American cities. In January, a person seeking to force the United States to release a convicted terrorist took hostages in a Texas synagogue, resulting in a standoff that thankfully ended in no casualties.

Given that there has been a steady increase in antisemitic incidents in America in recent years, including acts of violence, it would hardly be surprising if a new flare-up in the Middle East leads to a new round of attacks against Jews elsewhere.

That elements in the United States are supportive of anti-Jewish terrorism was made clear this week when several hundred demonstrators from radical groups marched through the streets of New York against Israel. While originally planned as a companion protest to March 30 “Land Day” demonstrations by Arabs inside Israel, those who showed up from a number of pro-BDS and anti-Zionist groups made clear their sentiments. They chanted “intifada until victory” and other slogans, such as “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” “resistance is justified when people are colonized,” “New York to Gaza, globalize the intifada” and “there is only one solution — intifada revolution.”

They can be dismissed as outliers. But what can’t be ignored is that their views are rooted in ideas propagated by anti-Israel groups like Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which may pose as advocates for human or civil rights and formally disavow antisemitism but which are instead strongholds of radicals who support Israel’s elimination.

The ability of such groups to successfully claim that they speak for all American Muslims is bad enough. Even more troubling is the way some on the Jewish left are willing to echo their claims that organizations that highlight their radicalism are bigoted. Pointing to the connection between Islamist beliefs and violence in the Middle East and elsewhere is common sense, not “anti-Muslim.”

The acceptance of some on the Jewish left of a false narrative about “Islamophobia” essentially disarms Jews and others in the struggle to speak up against those who support antisemitic activism. As JNS reported this week, a JCC in Omaha canceled the appearance of Richard Green of the Clarion Project, which monitors online extremism (and whose advisory board is partially composed of leading Muslim moderates) because of false claims from, among others, the local chapter of the Anti-Defamation League that it was a “far-right” and “anti-Muslim” group.

While deeply disturbing in and of itself, this mainstreaming of Islamists and the marginalization of anti-Islamists creates an environment in which antisemitism becomes normalized. Just as some blame Israel for those who hate it, the same thing happens with others who speak up against Islamists. The Islamophobia narrative essentially turns the truth on its head by treating any attention given to radical Muslims as hate while ignoring or rationalizing hatred for Jews and Israel.

It is also connected to the growing influence of intersectionality and critical race theory. Those toxic myths embraced by academia and many progressives falsely label Israel and its supporters as oppressors who are beneficiaries of “white privilege” and analogous to opponents of the American civil rights movement.

It is that way of thinking that has led many on the left to do the same for figures like Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who are essentially given a pass for their expressions of prejudice against Jews and support for the antisemitic BDS movement. Indeed, when they and other “progressive” colleagues like The Squad’s Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) reacted to the Hamas terror offensive with speeches in the US House of Representatives demonizing and smearing Israel, it was hardly surprising that violence against Jews in the United States followed.

What happened last spring demonstrated that the link between inflammatory rhetoric directed against Israel, which is steeped in traditional antisemitic tropes, to verbal and physical attacks in the streets remains far from tenuous.

Seen in that light, potential violence against American Jews during a theoretical third intifada is not something Mossad intelligence work can suppress. Rather, it is the product of a political culture that has legitimized antisemites and seeks to delegitimize their opponents. And rather than a natural reaction to Israeli behavior, potential anti-Jewish violence will be the result of the enabling of Jew-hatred by political and cultural forces that are dominated by those who buy into woke ideology. If Jews or Israelis are truly concerned about the potential for violence against American Jewish communities, then they should focus their attention on intersectional ideologues — both Jewish and non-Jewish — and not on futile efforts to curb antisemitism by those who will always blame Israel first.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2022-04-19/biden-administration-may-appeal-ruling-that-voided-travel-mask-mandate,Biden administration may appeal ruling that voided travel mask mandate,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Tuesday that it intends to appeal a Florida judge’s ruling that struck down a federal mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation — but only if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides that extending the measure is necessary.

The announcement from the Department of Justice came after a day of back and forth inside the White House, as administration officials faced a legal and political quandary: whether to let the judge’s ruling stand or to fight it, knowing that an appeal could result in a higher court, perhaps the Supreme Court, ruling against the administration and setting a lasting precedent that could undercut the CDC’s authority.

In the end, the administration charted a careful course, publicly objecting to Monday’s ruling but putting off a final decision about whether to contest it. The Justice Department and the CDC “disagree with the district court’s decision and will appeal, subject to CDC’s conclusion that the order remains necessary for public health,” the department said in a statement.

“You are in the position of having two horrible choices,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, an expert in public health law at Georgetown University. “One choice is to risk forever taking away CDC’s powers if this goes up to the 11th Circuit and ultimately the Supreme Court.

“And on the other hand,” he added, “if you let what I consider to be a lawless decision by this judge go forward, then CDC is going to be gun-shy about doing things that it deems effective for the protection of the American public.”

The mask mandate — which also applied to transportation hubs like airports and train stations, and even to ride-sharing services like Uber — had been set to expire May 3 even before the judge struck it down Monday.

If the CDC decides there is a public health basis for trying to reinstate and extend the mandate, the Justice Department will swiftly file an appeal. But if the CDC decides otherwise, the administration will not appeal and the case will instead end as mooted — but without any signal of executive branch acquiescence to the judge’s view of its authority.

The Justice Department “continues to believe that the order requiring masking in the transportation corridor is a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given CDC to protect the public health,” its statement said. “That is an important authority the department will continue to work to preserve.”

The CDC imposed the mandate in early 2021, at the direction of the president. The agency had already extended it several times, most recently last Wednesday. At the time, it said it wanted to keep the requirement in place several more weeks while it assessed the potential severity of the omicron subvariant known as BA.2, which recently became the dominant version among new U.S. cases.

As the administration considered its options Tuesday, White House officials, including President Joe Biden himself, were cautious in their public remarks. On a trip to New Hampshire to promote infrastructure spending, the president was asked by reporters whether people should wear masks on planes.

“That’s up to them,” Biden replied.

The U.S. District Court judge in Tampa, Florida, who struck down the mandate — Kathryn Kimball Mizelle — put forward a sharply constrained interpretation of the CDC’s legal authority under the Public Health Service Act of 1944. If her view prevailed, the agency’s hands would be tied in future public health crises.

But a ruling by a district court judge is not a binding precedent. Appealing the matter would carry the risk that the court that oversees her — the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta — could issue a ruling that constrains the agency’s future conduct at least in its region, the Southeastern United States. A majority of the judges on that circuit are also Trump appointees.

And above it, the Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. In January, it blocked a Biden administration edict that large employers require workers to get vaccinated or submit to regular testing. (On the other hand, the court has permitted military officials to require service members and reservists to get vaccinated; it also upheld a federal mandate requiring health care workers at facilities receiving federal money to be vaccinated.)

Dr. Thomas Frieden, who directed the CDC for eight years under President Barack Obama, noted that the CDC has “very little regulatory authority” and said other pandemic-related actions — including a moratorium on evictions and the use of the border authority known as Title 42 to keep immigrants from seeking asylum — may have, in effect, reduced the agency’s political capital to keep the mask mandate in place.

“The broader question is, what is the appropriate use of mandates,” Frieden said. “The clearest case is for interstate travel, and so there is the risk that by pushing the envelope on other issues, we lost some of the narrative on what is an appropriate use of mandates.”

Some supporters of the mask mandate have viewed an appeal as risky.

“As tempting at it is to appeal it, because it’s a ridiculous ruling, the bigger issue is that you need to reserve the ability for the CDC to act in case we have a big outbreak in the fall or the winter,” said Andy Slavitt, a former senior health adviser to Biden who helped run the administration’s COVID-19 response.

“Trump appointed 234 federal judges,” he added, “and if you end up there or in the Supreme Court, you could really damage your ability to respond to the pandemic in the future.”

But others spoke strongly in favor of an appeal.

“What worries me is the fact that this judge is saying that CDC doesn’t have the authority to protect the health of people in America as they best see fit,” said Dr. Rich Besser, a former acting director of the CDC. He added that if the ruling stands, it would be “really damaging, because going into the next event you’ve got this ruling there and it hasn’t been contested.”

As a matter of politics, support for mask mandates has fallen in opinion polls as it has become clearer that healthy people who have been vaccinated and boosted — as well as those who remain unvaccinated but have survived a bout of COVID-19 — are generally at lower risk of experiencing severe or life-threatening symptoms if they get infected.

“The country clearly wants to move on,” said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to Obama. “Mandatory masking is a volatile issue. So my instinct is that the path of least resistance would be to stand down, on the grounds the clock is quickly running out anyway.”

But some people remain strongly in favor of such mandates. They have pointed to the continuing serious risk that any infection poses to immunocompromised people despite vaccination, and to the fact that very young children — while less likely to experience significant symptoms — are not eligible for vaccination.

Monday’s ruling took officials in the White House by surprise and frustrated them, two senior officials said. But Tuesday, as travelers aboard airplanes took directions from pilots to unmask and riders aboard transit systems went mask-free, the Biden administration did not lay out a detailed plan to contest the ruling, even as public health experts warned that the CDC’s authority to prevent the spread of a contagious virus was on the line.

Inside the CDC, officials felt their most recent extension of the mask mandate was reasonable, to give them time to assess the evidence and make a considered decision about whether to continue it.

“CDC scientists had asked for 15 days to make a more data-driven durable decision,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the new White House coronavirus response coordinator, wrote on Twitter. “We should have given it to them. But I’ll continue to follow CDC guidance & mask up on planes.”

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2354420/gangster-acquitted-in-more-cases,‘Gangster’ acquitted in more cases,"A special anti-terrorism court has acquitted alleged Lyari gangsters Uzair Baloch and another suspect named Shahid for lack of evidence.

The court ruled that the prosecution ailed to prove the charges against Baloch and others. Defence counsel Advocate Abid Zaman argued that not a single witness came forward to name Baloch in any crime. ""The allegations made by the prosecution are false,"" he said.

According to police, there were several charges against Baloch, including attempted murder and possession of explosives. A case was registered against the suspect at the Napier police station in 2012.

In 2021, Baloch said he never gave a confessional statement about collecting extortion money and sending a share to Pakisan Peoples Party leaders.

Following his arrest in 2015, a confessional statement by the alleged crime lord appeared in 2016 in which he admitted to committing criminal activities in connivance with the Karachi police and political set-up in the province.

As per the statement, he confessed to have collected Rs20 million extortion from different persons and departments every month, adding that the fisheries department would pay Rs2 million and gave Rs10 million per month to a senior leader of PPP.

However, Baloch has denied this statement later.

Subsequently, the request of a judicial magistrate to have his statement recorded via video link was rejected by a special anti-terrorism court.

The magistrate put this request forward as he was unable to appear in person in relation to his recording of the confessional statement of alleged Lyari gangster Uzair Baloch.

Special Court No 16 of the Anti-Terrorism Complex in Karachi Central Jail rejected the plea while it was hearing a case against the murder of a Rangers official. The court summoned the judicial magistrate and the investigating officer, in person, at the next hearing.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed that a Border Patrol officer killed the teenager, Salvador Ramos, and commended law enforcement for showing ""amazing courage by running toward gunfire to try to save lives.""

TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING: LIVE UPDATES

On the Buffalo Public Schools website is an emergency bulletin noting new rules which will be ""effective immediately."" The city of Buffalo is also grieving from a mass shooting at a Top's grocery store last week where a self-described White supremacist reportedly killed 10 people dead and three injured.

""For the safety of all, the doors at each of our school locations will remain locked during the school day,"" the Buffalo Schools statement read. ""There are camera monitors at the front entrance of each of our school sites. All visitors, parents, and caregivers will need to announce their name and the name of their child in order to be buzzed into a school. Upon entry, visitors may be subjected to wanding and/or a search process for safety measures. The Buffalo Police Department and/or Buffalo Public Schools Security staff will have a presence in and around schools for an undetermined amount of time.""

San Antonio-area school districts have also released new safety protocols, several of which included an increased police presence on campuses.

""Tomorrow, out of an abundance of caution, we will have a police presence monitoring all of our campuses,"" the Alamo Heights Independent School District relayed. ""Although there are no known threats to any of our schools, this will provide additional support as we complete the final day of school including all the campus activities that are planned. All end of year events will be held as scheduled.""

Edgewood ISD Superintendent of Schools Dr. Eduardo Hernández similarly noted in a statement that additional officers will be assigned to campuses through the end of the school year.

""I want to reassure the EISD community that student safety in Edgewood ISD is top priority,"" Hernández said. ""As preventive measures taken prior to today's devastating events, the EISD Police Department patrols the 16 square miles of our district all day and night. They will also be present at our campuses with increased frequency and will be highly visible. EISD does not condone any acts of violence.""

Paul Heroux, the mayor of Attleboro, Massachusetts, released detailed information about a gunshot detection system following the Texas tragedy.

""We have funded and installed a gunshot detection system at all 9 of our city schools; the new high school will have the 9th system,"" Heroux tweeted. ""We are still setting up a system in the new high school. These gunshot detection systems will immediately notify the police department and anyone else on the notification list when the system is triggered by a gunshot. If we reduce police presence time, we save lives.""

The technology, Heroux said, is the same installed in the White House and the Pentagon.

The Attleboro Police Department is also doing active shooting training, where police simulate what to do and how to respond in the event if there is an active shooter in one of our schools, Heroux added.

The South San Antonio Independent School District announced that no backpacks will be allowed at any campuses for the next two days and that campus accessibility will be limited to parents/guardians with proper identification.

Lopez, 46, had been on the run since escaping a prison bus May 12 in Leon County.

A Texas prison system spokesman said Lopez killed a Houston family of five in their weekend cabin and took their pickup truck. He was spotted in the truck in Jourdanton, Texas, roughly 35 miles south of San Antonio.

A shootout ensued — and Lopez was killed — after authorities used spike strips to blow out the tires. Lopez came out of the truck shooting an AR-15 at officers. Officers there engaged in gunfire with Lopez, killing him, according to Jason Clark with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. In addition to the AR-15, he had a pistol, Clark said.

The rural cabin where the family was killed is along Hwy 7 west of Centerville. Authorities found the bodies of a grandfather and four grandchildren inside. The cabin is located near where Lopez escaped the prison bus. It wasn't immediately clear if Lopez had been staying in the cabin since his escape.

Affiliated with the “Mexican Mafia,” Lopez had ties to San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley. In 2006, he was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of capital murder and aggravated kidnapping. He received a second life sentence in 2007 for attempted capital murder. In 1996, he received two eight-year sentences for two counts of aggravated assault.

UPDATE (11:46 p.m.) – TDCJ officials now say that officers found four minors and one adult dead earlier today inside the home in Leon County.

Officials with the agency said originally that authorities found two adults and three children killed that they believed to be tied to Gonzalo Lopez.

Correction: The TDCJ received updated information regarding the victims. The victims included one adult and four minors. Law enforcement remains on scene and continues to process incident information. https://t.co/OkYxXXbdZ4 — TDCJ (@TDCJ) June 3, 2022

They have yet to release any further information but said the investigation at the home off of SH-7 is ongoing.

UPDATE (11:29 p.m.) – The Texas Department of Criminal Justice says cartel killer Gonzalo Lopez is dead.

Officials said that the vehicle matching one that Lopez fled in from Leon County was spotted by deputies with the Atascosa County Sheriff's Office.

They said deputies used a device to deflate the vehicles tires outside Jourdanton, Texas, and Lopez came out the truck shooting an AR-15 at officers.

Officers there engaged in gunfire with Lopez, killing him, according to Jason Clark with TDCJ.

Clark said Lopez had a handgun in the vehicle along with the assault rifle.

UPDATE (10:48 p.m.) – Convicted cartel killer Gonzalo Lopez is in custody tonight after fleeing from custody over three weeks ago, police said.

McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara told 25 News law enforcement in Atascosa County caught the fugitive murderer earlier Thursday night.

Authorities said Lopez was traveling in the Chevrolet Silverado belonging to a family that they believe he may have killed in Leon County.

No word yet on Lopez's intended destination.

This comes as authorities made a gruesome discovery inside a home near Centerville, where the bodies of two adults and three children were found.

https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/abortion-under-attack-doctors-push-back-criminalizing-care,"With abortion under attack, doctors push back on criminalizing care","Responding to the growing threat of over-policing and surveillance of reproductive health services, the nation’s physicians and medical students at the 2022 AMA Annual Meeting in Chicago adopted policy recognizing that it is a violation of human rights when government intrudes into medicine and impedes access to safe, evidence-based reproductive health services, including abortion and contraception.

Your Powerful Ally The AMA is your powerful ally, focused on addressing the issues important to you, so you can focus on what matters most—patients. We will meet this challenge together. Join Us

In accordance with the new policy, the AMA will seek expanded legal protections for patients and physicians against government systems of control and punishment that criminalize reproductive health services.

“A growing number of current and pending laws insert government into the patient-physician relationship by dictating limits or bans on reproductive health services and while also aiming to criminally punish patients for their health decisions,” said Jack Resneck Jr., MD, who will be inaugurated as AMA president today.

“The new policy also calls for AMA to seek legal protections for patients who cross state lines to receive reproductive health services, as well as legal protections for physicians and others who support or provide reproductive health services or referrals to patients who cross state lines.”

Related Coverage Unconstitutional attack on reproductive health must not stand

The AMA House of Delegates adopted new policy to:

Recognize that health care, including reproductive health services like contraception and abortion, is a human right.

Oppose limitations on access to evidence-based reproductive health services, including fertility treatments, contraception and abortion.

Work with interested state medical societies and medical specialty societies to vigorously advocate for broad, equitable access to reproductive health services, including fertility treatments, contraception and abortion.

Support shared decision-making between patients and their physicians regarding reproductive health care.

Oppose any effort to undermine the basic medical principle that clinical assessments, such as viability of the pregnancy and safety of the pregnant person, are determinations to be made only by health care professionals with their patients.

Oppose the imposition of criminal and civil penalties or other retaliatory efforts against patients, patient advocates, physicians, other health care workers, and health systems for receiving, assisting in, referring patients to, or providing reproductive health services.

Advocate legal protections for patients who cross state lines to receive reproductive health services, including contraception and abortion, or who receive medications for contraception and abortion from across state lines, and legal protections for those that provide, support or refer patients to these services.

Delegates also directed the AMA to review its policy compendium and recommend those “which should be amended or rescinded to reflect these core values.” The AMA will report back to the House of Delegates at the 2022 AMA Interim Meeting.

The newly adopted policy strengthens the AMA’s long-held position opposing political intrusions into the practice of medicine that infringe on the patient-physician relationship and compromise patient access to safe, evidence-based medical care.

In an amicus brief (PDF) filed to U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the AMA—along with dozens of leading medical organizations—stated that abortion is safe medical care that is a decision to be made between the patient and the physician, subject to the physician's clinical judgment, and the patient's informed consent.

An AMA Leadership Viewpoints column, “Unconstitutional attack on reproductive health must not stand,” was published last fall in advance of the Supreme Court oral arguments.

https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/04/20/indigenous-artifacts-barre-ancestors-belongings-resolution,"After visit from Sioux leaders, Barre Museum says it will evaluate collection for repatriation","The Barre Museum Association this week voted to start the process to return objects that once belonged to indigenous people. The vote comes a few days after native leaders from South Dakota visited the museum to lay claim to their ancestors’ belongings.

Renee and Manny Iron Hawk, from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and Chief Henry Red Cloud, who represents the Oglala Lakota, part of the Sioux nation, stood outside the public library which houses the tiny Barre Museum. Before going in, they burned sage to ""smudge,"" a ritual to purify themselves out of respect for the ancestors whose items they’re about to see.

""I share this smudge with everybody, all the light-skinned people that are here,"" Red Cloud said.

Red Cloud believes items in the museum were taken off the bodies of native people who were killed by white soldiers in Wounded Knee, South Dakota, on Dec. 29, 1890. Hundreds were massacred, including Manny Iron Hawk’s grandfather, Ghost Horse.

Iron Hawk said their ancestors are with them.

""I do believe they're here today, waiting for their items to return,"" he said. ""I am glad, today, very happy. And I'm also sad spiritually, but these things are coming to the right way now.""

Native people have come here since at least the early 1990s trying to get things back.

The museum has more than 200 items, not all native, in dimly lit glass cabinets. Some may have been treated with arsenic for preservation, so handling them is complicated.

Before the pandemic, the museum was open six times a year.

Ann Meilus, president of the Barre Museum Association, said the objects were donated to the museum in the late 1800s by resident Frank Root.

""Root was a showman,"" Meilus said. ""He played up the Wounded Knee massacre, unfortunately, as his shtick to get people to come and view the Native American artifacts.""

Meilus said there is documentation showing a lot of the items were sold to tourists by Lakota people, and she said some items were mislabeled to engage the imaginations of visitors.

""I highly doubt if they really are off the bodies of the people at Wounded Knee. But that nevertheless does not curb the awful tragedy that happened at Wounded Knee. We would like resolution to this,"" Meilus said. ""I’ve been dealing with this for over 20 years.""

Meilus said the museum has had contact with different native people about the items for decades. She said she wants to make sure the museum is dealing with the legal tribal council.

But a resolution is in the works.

""I shake your hand with a warm heart. Greetings to you,"" Chief Red Cloud said after visiting the museum, addressing a crowd of supporters inside a nearby church. ""It’s an honor for me to be here. To be able to view the collection across the street. But better yet, going to be able to take the items home.""

Red Cloud said in the early 1990s, his cousins, uncle and aunts also visited Barre, trying to get things back. He said a lock of human hair, part of a scalp, was returned later that decade. He said when someone dies, a spirit-releasing ceremony has to take place.

""And that didn't happen for the ancestors across the street over here,"" Red Cloud said. ""So they're stuck in this limbo. They're stuck here. So we're going to make a way. The items are going to be be going home. But it's going to take some time.""

Manny Iron Hawk also stood before the crowd, holding up a photograph of his grandmother.

“My grandma here, she survived the Wounded Knee massacre at the age of ten,"" he said.

Iron Hawk told the story that was passed down from his grandmother, to his mother, to him. His grandmother always remembered how her grandmother took care of her during the massacre.

""As soon as the shooting starts, your grandma grabs you by the hand and runs to the nearest ravine. ‘Run, run, run! Because the cavalry is going to come after you. They’re going to hunt you down and kill you,’ ” he said.

Iron Hawk’s grandfather and his son were killed, protecting their people.""So that’s the trauma that we have today, the Wounded Knee descendants. There’s a point we need to start healing and it began today,"" Iron Hawk said. ""Thank you.""Red Cloud said he saw a number of items in the museum that he believes will be returned.

""A ghost dance shirt. I saw a saddle. I saw a headdress,"" he said. ""I saw moccasins of various sizes. I saw headgear, representing our tribe. I saw clothing that that our ancestors would have worn in that era.""

He said he also saw human hair, part of a scalp.

Meilus, the museum board president, doubts that. She said some of the items are decorated with horse hair. But the museum, which has only about $300, will apply for grants to hire a specialist to evaluate the entire collection.

""Anything that's clearly spiritually associated with a tribe or used for funerary purposes or has human body parts — if there is anything left in the museum that has human body parts — that we would repatriate it to the proper tribe or attempt to identify the proper tribe,"" she said.

Museum officials plan to follow a federal repatriation law, even though they are not bound by it, Meilus said, because the museum has not received federal funding.

Meilus said there is “a certain amount of sadness about potentially breaking up the collection.""

But, she said, ""If anything brings the Lakota Sioux people closure for what happened at Wounded Knee — if we have to give up some stuff, if that gets them one step closer to closing, the trauma that they have suffered — I'm all for it.""

Renee Iron Hawk, the secretary of the Wounded Knee Descendants Association, said she supports following the repatriation law and having experts evaluate items. Still, she said, ""I just don't want all that paperwork, red tape to prevent us from receiving back our relatives' items.""

She said when someone dies in her culture, after a year, they hold a ceremony.

""I would suggest that a 'Wiping of the Tears' occur with our relatives’ artifacts returned. And maybe we could do it here with you guys since they have been among you for so long,"" she said. ""Maybe you need to wipe your tears too.""

Red Cloud said it could be a year or more before items that belonged to those massacred at Wounded Knee are returned. But on this day, he said, his inner spirit was happy.

Then, he sang a unity song honoring the descendants and the people of Barre, encouraging the residents to remind the museum to return the items.

https://kyma.com/news/2022/06/02/gunman-who-killed-4-at-oklahoma-medical-building-had-been-a-patient-of-a-victim-police-chief-says/,"Gunman who killed 4 at Oklahoma medical building had been a patient of a victim, police chief says","By Jason Hanna, Amanda Watts, Shimon Prokupecz and Travis Caldwell, CNN

(CNN) -- The gunman who killed two doctors and two others at an Oklahoma medical building Wednesday did so after he blamed one of the physicians for causing him pain from a May back surgery, a police chief said Thursday.

Shooter Michael Louis, who police said killed himself after the rampage in Tulsa, had just earlier that afternoon legally purchased one of the firearms used in the slaughter, an AR-15 style rifle, city Police Chief Wendell Franklin said during a news conference.

Louis entered a physicians' office building at Tulsa's Saint Francis Hospital campus late Wednesday afternoon and shot dead his erstwhile surgeon, Dr. Preston Phillips, and three other people before fatally shooting himself, said Franklin.

The other three victims at the Natalie Medical Building were Dr. Stephanie Husen, receptionist Amanda Glenn and patient William Love, authorities said.

Officers found a letter on Louis that ""made it clear that he came in with the intent to kill Dr. Phillips and anyone who got in his way,"" Franklin said.

""He blamed Dr. Phillips for the ongoing pain following the surgery,"" Franklin said, later calling the letter's contents ""a clear motive.""

The others, Franklin said, just ""stood in the way, and Louis gunned them down.""

An unspecified number of other people were injured in the shooting on the building's second floor, officials said at Thursday's news conference, declining to say whether the injuries were caused by gunshots or attempts to flee the violence. Authorities had earlier said that fewer than 10 people had non-life-threatening injuries

The mass shooting is among the latest instances nationwide of first responders and civilians coming face-to-face with the threat of gun violence in public places. It comes more than two weeks after a racist assault at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a bloody attack at a church in California; and eight days after a heartbreaking massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

The Tulsa shooting is one of the 233 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. CNN and the archive define a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.

Louis, of Muskogee, a city roughly 45 miles southeast of Tulsa, had back surgery on May 19 performed by Phillips, and was released from a hospital May 24. He then called Phillips' office several times over several days, complaining of pain and wanting additional treatment, according to Franklin.

Louis saw Phillips on Tuesday for treatment, and called Phillips' office again on Wednesday before the shooting, ""complaining of back pain and wanting additional assistance,"" Franklin said.

Louis bought an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle from a gun store at 2 p.m. Wednesday, Franklin said. Louis also had bought a .40-caliber pistol from a pawn shop on Sunday, Franklin said.

The two firearms were both found at the scene, Tulsa police Capt. Richard Meulenberg told CNN on Wednesday. ""It was just madness inside, with hundreds of rooms and hundreds of people trying to get out of the building,"" Meulenberg told CNN.

Person on video chat with doctor called 911,

Police were initially alerted about the shooting in a 911 at 4:53 p.m. Wednesday. The call was made by someone off campus who'd been on a video chat with a doctor who was at the building, Franklin said.

""The doctor told her to call 911, saying there has been a shooting,"" Franklin said.

Responding officers arrived at 4:56 p.m., Franklin said. Two minutes later, officers who'd reached the second floor heard a gunshot, the chief said.

""We believe that was the final gunshot, with the suspect taking his own life,"" Franklin said.

At least one slain person was found in the same room as the gunman, as well as an uninjured female who was ""hiding under a desk at the suspect's foot,"" Franklin said.

Witnesses describe frantic first moments

Lachelle Nathan told CNN affiliate KTUL that she had arrived in her vehicle with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren for a doctor's appointment when she saw multiple officers race toward the complex.

""It's awful, it's sad. My daughter-in-law is from Buffalo, so now it's so close to home. It's not even safe if you come outside anymore, you know?"" Nathan said.

""I mean, you see it on TV,"" her daughter-in-law said, ""but you don't think it's actually going to happen right in front of your eyes, so this is a wakeup call for my kids, this can really happen anywhere and it's very scary.""

""You can't even go to a store, you can't even go to school, now you can't go to the doctor?""

Debra Proctor was in another building on the hospital campus for an appointment when she heard police sirens.

""Police were everywhere in the parking lot, up and down the surrounding blocks,"" said Proctor, a registered nurse for more than four decades. ""They were still arriving when I was leaving.""

Kalen Davis, a lifelong Tulsa resident, was waiting in traffic around 5 p.m. local time when she saw multiple police cars responding to the scene.

In a video she shared with CNN, authorities can be seen running toward a building with their guns drawn. Two officers are seen taking long guns out of their trunks as more emergency vehicles race to the scene.

""I just knew that it was a shooting situation because I saw police running with rifles,"" Davis, 45, told CNN. ""That's when I got emotional.""

Shooting occurred at town 'sacred ground'

Saint Francis Health System, which runs the hospital, said in a statement that some offices will be closed for the remainder of the week.

Oklahoma state Rep. Melissa Provenzano, whose district includes the hospital, told CNN she was on campus the morning of the shooting and called it ""the center of our community.""

""This is just one of the hallmark locations in our town,"" she said, and credited hospital staff there for saving her father's life when he contracted Covid-19.

""This campus is sacred ground for our community,"" said Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum, who also expressed ""profound gratitude"" for the first responders who ""did not hesitate today to respond to this act of violence.""

""The men and women of the Tulsa Police Department did not hesitate,"" the mayor said.

Provenzano also hailed the effective police response yet urged more proactive work is needed to curb similar shootings in the future.

""I just can't say enough good things about them,"" she said of the police, ""but you know, why were they needed in the first place?""

Pointing to gun accessibility and the need for ""red flag"" laws, she added, ""We can do so much more here in Oklahoma to make these things preventable,"" she said.

https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/fcc-fines-methow-valley-communications,FCC Fines Methow Valley Communications,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—The Media Bureau of the FCC has issued an opinion and order fining Methow Valley Communications for violations relating to TV translator station K44EN-D in Methow Washington.

The FCC ordered that Methow be fined $6,500 for the violations, which included operating a station without a license for more than three years.

It noted however that upon the completion of this forfeiture proceeding it would grant Methow a license for the translator station ""if there are no issues other than the apparent violation.""

In explaining its ruling, the FCC said that in 2017 the TV translator station was displaced off channel 44, a portion of which had been reassigned to wireless broadband services, and Methow Valley Communications, which had the permit for the station, filed a request to continue temporarily operating the station.

The FCC said it “subsequently granted the channel 36 digital displacement application for on November 26, 2018, with an expiration date of November 26, 2021. However, Permittee did not file an application for license to cover by November 26, 2021, and the Displacement CP [construction permit] expired on its own terms that day pursuant to section 74.788(b) of the Rules.”

The FCC noted that Methow told the agency that it had ""completed construction of the Station in accordance with the construction permit granted by the Commission and previously commenced operation of those facilities pursuant to a valid STA in June 2018. Permittee states that it overlooked submitting the license to cover at that time.”

In response the FCC said that “administrative oversight is not an excuse for failure to comply with the Commission’s rules.”

In imposing the $6,500 fine, the FCC noted that it had fined other LPTV and TV translator licensees $3,500 but imposed a higher amount in this case because the “[l]icensee failed to file a timely license to cover for the Station when it completed construction of its Displacement CP facilities in the Fall of 2018, and not only filed its Application nearly six months after its construction permit expired, but engaged in unauthorized operation of the Station for over three years.”

“[W]e find the Licensee’s failure represents extreme disregard, or at best ignorance, of Commission’s licensing processes and the Act itself,” the FCC order stated. “We will also grant the Permittee’s waiver request and waive section 74.788 of the Rules, reinstate the construction permit, and grant the Application by separate action upon the conclusion of this forfeiture proceeding if there are no issues other than the apparent violation that would preclude grant of the Application.”

The order also states that Methow had 30 days to pay the fine or to file a petition to have the fine reduced or canceled.",Q2
https://khak.com/sad-news-domestic-abuse-deaths-on-the-rise-in-iowa/,Sad News: Domestic Abuse Deaths on the Rise in Iowa,"In 2021, there were more deaths in relation to domestic abuse in Iowa than at any time in the last ten years.

According to KCCI, ""The Iowa Attorney General's Office said 14 women, four men, and two bystanders were killed last year. Four of them died in the last four months of 2021."" Per the Des Moines Register in late October of 2021, 15 of the victims were murdered by current or former partners.

Through the first four months of 2022, three Iowa women have already died as the result of domestic violence.

Based on funding provided by the state, it looks like things aren't necessarily going to get better, either. KCCI adds ""The attorney general announced a 20% decrease in 2021 funding from the legislature for its Crime Victim Assistance Division. The funding reduction could result in 23,000 fewer victims being helped over the next two years, according to the attorney general.""

In a story put together by the Des Moines Register, the director of the state's Crime Victim Assistance Division Sandy Tibbets Murphy, pointed to the effects of COVID-19 as to the increase in death. She said this in a press release:

Some victims can’t leave their homes and services haven’t been as accessible. These issues have limited the ability to serve victims. And sadly, research has shown when services are limited, we see a rise in domestic violence homicides.

Policy director for the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence Laura Hesburg, points to the growing amount of gun owners as one key factor in the increased death rates.

This is what she said:

Usually, half of female homicide victims are killed with a gun. Last year, nine of the 10 of the women partners murdered in domestic violence incidents were killed with a gun, and four of five bystanders were killed with a gun.

The Register adds this of the deaths in this category over the last 27 years: ""the Attorney General's office has tallied 358 homicides tied to domestic violence, including 242 women and 47 men killed by partners and 69 non-partner bystanders. Twenty-nine children and five unborn fetuses were also among those killed. The most common murder method was firearms, which were used in 55% of the homicides.""

We started by looking at the company’s history; the State Department’s website had all the needed information. They had to register in the United States, so we checked their registration status.





To obtain a U.S. trademark, a company must use only safe production methods in well-guarded facilities, and its products must be free of contaminants.





Customer Service





If a company sells health-enhancing products, it should respond quickly to customers with any issues.

In addition, proper guidance from companies helps protect users from overdosing risks. Because of this, we decided only to include companies that provide exceptional customer service in this review.





Ingredients





The safety of a product is determined by its ingredients. As a result, we only chose CBD brands whose organic CBD gummies are made from cannabis plants that have been organically grown.





In addition, we only selected CBD brands that use high-quality ingredients, guaranteeing high-quality products.





Product Safety





Clients place a high value on the product’s safety. So, we first looked for brands that used organic ingredients that were safe to eat. Our next step was to ensure the CBD products were tested in an independent lab and found completely safe. Because CO2 extraction is considered safe, we chose brands that use this method.





Third-Party Lab Testing





A third-party laboratory should test all products, as chemicals and other potentially harmful substances are screened during testing. If hazardous substances are not thoroughly tested, they could cause serious health issues. As a result, we checked to see if the companies in question had tested their products in an independent lab.





Price





Quality products that are reasonably priced were also considered. As far as we know, such items exist, but they come at a steep price. Our goal is to prevent you from overspending, so our team puts in a lot of time and effort to find the best deals. Moreover, you can rest assured that these brands prioritize quality.",Q2

https://www.claremontindependent.com/post/american-semiconductors-will-give-the-us-an-edge-over-china-in-the-technological-cold-war,American Semiconductors Will Give the US an Edge Over China in the Technological Cold War,"The United States is engaged in a technological cold war with China because of our dependence on East Asian semiconductors. Semiconductors power almost everything we touch — cell phones, computers and cars depend on them. Congress has a bill at its fingertips that will spur American microchip manufacturing: the US Innovation and Competition Act. It must pass.





This new cold war revolves around the pursuit of technology that will define the 21st century — principally semiconductors, artificial intelligence and 5G. The United States is not just engaged in economic competition with China, but rather a digital battle to control these technologies. Semiconductors are at the frontline of the war.





Semiconductors are materials that have electrical conductivity between a conductor, such as silicon, and an insulator, such as glass. They are imperative for the production of integrated circuits, or microchips, that power most technology, from washing machines to F-15 fighter jets. As one U.S. senator put it, semiconductors are the “oil of the 21st century.”





The small island nation of Taiwan holds 53% of the globe’s semiconductor market through the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Some of the world’s largest technology companies, including Apple, rely on the firm to build microchips for their products. The Chinese Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping, however, believe that Taiwan has always been part of China: Beijing has promised to “reunify” Taiwan with China. Xi Jinping has also increased cross-strait military activity recently, flying a record number of fighter jets through Taiwan airspace last year.





If China takes control of Taiwan, it will weaponize Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity for the advancement of authoritarianism around the world. China can use semiconductors to perfect dictatorial practices because of military-civil fusion — a section of the CCP constitution that encourages Chinese companies to share their technology with the government. This poses a grave national security threat to the United States and democracies around the world.





While the CCP has its eyes set on Taiwan, they are also rapidly expanding China's domestic semiconductor production capacity. In 2020, the Chinese semiconductor industry enjoyed a 30.6% annual growth rate, reaching $40 billion in annual sales. This helped China gain 9% of the world’s semiconductor market.





The CCP understands that semiconductors will power the 21st century. The United States needs to demonstrate the same urgency; this starts with the US Innovation and Competition Act.





The US Innovation and Competition Act — or the USICA — helps ensure that semiconductors are made in America. The bill — which passed the US Senate in 2021 by a 68-32 vote — invests more than $200 billion into U.S. technological innovation. At the center of the legislation is $52 billion of funding for the domestic semiconductor industry. Semiconductor plants across the country are already being built, such as the $20 billion Intel plant outside Columbus, Ohio. The USICA will spur more American semiconductor manufacturing — if Congress can settle its political differences regarding the bill.





In February, the House of Representatives passed the COMPETES Act — their own version of the bill. The legislation in both chambers provides incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. House Democrats, however, do not support the harsh language that the USICA directs towards China and the CCP. Unlike its Senate counterpart, the COMPETES Act fails to include specified funding for AI and quantum computing. Both chambers — whose members will go home soon to seek re-election — will need to work out these legislative differences soon. American national security is at stake.





To be sure, the U.S. has gained much from its economic relationship with China. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization and became integrated in the global financial system. Ever since then, the United States has enjoyed significant economic growth : China is the U.S’s third-largest export market, supporting two million jobs. American companies earn hundreds of billions of dollars every year from Chinese sales. Decades of economic cooperation complicates efforts to minimize American dependence on Chinese manufacturing.





This technological cold war, therefore, requires fresh thinking. The strategy starts with USICA, which invests in our ability to win the digital war with China. Government investment in semiconductors will signal to the CCP that the United States will not be at the mercy of technology-powered authoritarianism.

https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/state-corrections-department-will-release-4-500-inmates-beginning-july-1/article_24a9eec0-65e9-5d13-a8a5-2ea1fbb72d97.html,"State corrections department will release 4,500 inmates beginning July 1","Virginia Department of Corrections officials say thousands of inmates who have accumulated enough early release credits to lessen their sentences will be released from custody this summer.

“Right now, our current estimate is approximately 4,500 inmates will qualify in this program,” Benjamin Jarvela said, director of communications for the Virginia Department of Corrections. “What that means is, they’re going to be released during a 60-day window that’s going to spread from July 1 through Aug. 30.”

The early outs are the result of a July 1 start date of House Bill 5148, a law that allows certain inmates to earn up to 15 days off for every 30 days they are confined. Under the previous law, inmates could only earn only a maximum of 4.5 days off for every 30 days served. Jarvela said beyond the 4,500 inmates being initially released this summer, the majority of state inmates will also see their sentences reduced over time as well.

The provisions of the bill—one of many criminal justice reform laws signed by former Gov. Ralph Northam in 2020 and opposed by every GOP lawmaker in Richmond—requires the calculation of earned sentence credits to apply retroactively to the entire sentence of any inmate who is confined in a state correctional facility and who is participating in the earned sentence credit system.

Joshua Cole, the former delegate for House District 28, supported the bill while he was serving in office. Cole said he voted in favor of awarding credits to inmates primarily because Virginia hasn’t had a parole option for state inmates since 1995. Prior to that, parole was the only incentive inmates had for a possible reduced sentence. Cole said early release credits offer a similar incentive.

“This was a way to reward them for their good behavior, they got to earn credits, they were doing what they were supposed to and they were showing that their lives were improving,” Cole said. “They had the ability to cash these in and get some time off.”

Prison officials said credits are earned by inmates by attending in-facility sessions on parenting, mental health, substance abuse, job training, technical education and programs that lead to a valid Virginia drivers’ license upon their release. Jarvela said inmates are made aware of the early release credits program during the course of their incarceration as well as the potential impact completion of the program will have on their sentences.

“We’re going to make sure internally that the (inmates) are prepared to reenter their communities and they’ve completed the programming they need to complete,” Jarvela said.

Jarvela said his organization will be responsible for calculating adjusted release dates for eligible inmates based on the credits they have earned.

“And that’s basically anybody with a felony conviction and a sentence greater than 12 months,” Jarvela said.

First drafts of the original early release credit bill, introduced by Del. Don Scott, D–Portsmouth, included crimes such as solicitation to commit murder, kidnapping, abduction, assault, bodily wounding, robbery, carjacking and voluntary manslaughter but by its final version, the law excluded these crimes from the early released credit program, Shawn Weneta said, a policy strategist with the Virginia American Civil Liberties Union and a co-author of the bill.

“It’s just like anybody who commits a white collar crime, embezzlement, shoplifting, drug charges, they were sentenced to a certain amount of time to serve,” Juanita Shanks said, president and CEO of FailSafe-ERA, a Spotsylvania County nonprofit that specializes in helping former inmates with life skills and financial training, workforce training, mental health care, employment best practices and finding a safe place to live.

“They’ve served their time, they’ve given back, they’ve done their sentence,” Shanks said.

Jarvela said release calculations for inmates whose sentences fall below the 12-month threshold will be calculated by the regional jail where they are being held.

Locally, Col. Kevin Hudson, superintendent of the Rappahannock Regional Jail, said there are roughly 350 state-responsible inmates housed at his facility. He said they are among the 4,500 inmates being reviewed statewide by the Department of Corrections for early release.

On Nov. 8, Travis Payne of Manassas Park was released from the state prison system after serving most of his life behind bars. In 2004 at age 16, he was arrested for robbing a Stafford gas station at gunpoint and was sentenced to 52 years in prison with all but 12 years of his sentence suspended. He left prison at age 28 but due to a parole violation, he wound up back in state prison for an additional five years.

Payne, who is now 34, said over the last two years of his sentence, the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible to participate in any type of reentry training as those classes were canceled and volunteers and instructors who led them were kept out of facilities. He said without any recent training, inmates being released this summer will have a tough uphill climb in whatever community they choose to settle in.

“Over the past two years, nobody has been able to take a trade, nobody’s been able to learn anything, so honestly, you’ve got all these people coming home in a couple months and all they’ve done is sat in pretty much solitude for the past two years,” Payne said.

Payne said the limited amount of basic reentry training he was able to receive while incarcerated didn’t come close to preparing him for reentry back into today’s technology-savvy society. He said things like Facebook, smartphones and flat-screen televisions were all nonexistent when he first went to prison in the early 2000s, and every day it’s a struggle to learn something new.

“I guess you can compare it to a person who goes to Tokyo their first time with no preparation, and expecting them to know how to survive and thrive in Tokyo,” Payne said.

Brenda Amaya of Spotsylvania said her 33-year-old brother James will be released in June after completing his four-year sentence. Amaya said her brother participated in reentry courses at the Green Rock Correction Center in Chatham, but he told her those classes didn’t always take place.

“It doesn’t sound like a consistent, stable program, and then COVID shut everything down,” Amaya said. “He went to Haynesville and he noticed it was better structured there. He could just tell it was more organized and they were consistent with it.”

Officials confirm many of the classes inmates participated in did come to a halt during the pandemic, when volunteers, members of the ministry and others could not enter corrections facilities to conduct training. Both Jarvela and Hudson said those programs are once again beginning to ramp up for all inmates.

Amaya now worries there are a limited number of resources in the Fredericksburg region for the returning inmates and their families to turn to, but she found help through FailSafe.

Shanks said her organization is a resource hub for Planning District 16 that provides the training for who she calls “returning citizens” as well as their families through support group meetings, family outings, counseling and youth programs.

“We have the people on our staff that have the credentials to provide the training that they need,” Shanks said. “We could put them in a house, we can give them a job, but if we don’t change the way that they think it means nothing.”

In late 2020, Shanks formed a Criminal Justice Reform task force for Planning District 16—which includes Fredericksburg and Stafford, Spotsylvania, Caroline and King George counties. Made up of leaders in the region, the group identified four main barriers to successful reentry in the Fredericksburg region, including a lack of affordable housing, education, workforce training and treatment for mental health or substance abuse disorders.

“We’ve had meetings since November 2020 when this legislation was announced,” Shanks said. “I want the community to understand, we have community buy-in that’s looking into this.”

Payne said all he wants is a fair second chance for former inmates to succeed on their own, but he said renters and employers in the region are not universally receptive to extending a helping hand to former inmates. He said if they were willing to listen and ask former inmates why they are serious about changing their lives and slowly bring on those who show a desire to make a difference in their lives and in the community, they might be surprised.

“Maybe give them a probation period,” Payne said. “You have people that can do better and want to do better. It’s hard enough for one guy looking for a job now and now we have 4,500 that are going to be looking?”

Jarvela said there are 40 Virginia Department of Corrections facilities across the state. He expects inmates will be released from every facility in the network in July and August “to varying degrees,” saying places like Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, which has a population of just over 2,300 inmates, will likely have more inmates released late this summer than the smaller facilities in the corrections network.

Shanks said those returning inmates who choose to lead successful, productive and responsible lives in communities should be offered ample resources to make their transitions as smooth as possible. She said communities must also be willing to provide them the necessary tools, training, housing and employment they need to become independent citizens again.

“The community has a responsibility,” Shanks said. “If we consider ourselves a community and a country that believes in second chances, then we’re going to make sure they have what they need to become better.”",Q2

The former president told Punchbowl News on Tuesday afternoon that it would be good to at least 'have a voice' on the panel as it conducts very public and televised hearings.

'Well, I think in retrospect, I think it would have been very smart to put' Republicans on the committee 'to just have a voice,' Trump said.

'I wasn't involved in it from a standpoint so I never looked at it too closely,' he added. 'But I think it would have been good if we had representation.'

'The Republicans don't have a voice. They don't even have anything to say,' the former president lamented.

When the committee started to take its form shortly after the January 6 Capitol riot in the Democrat-led House, GOP Minority Leader McCarthy chose five members of his caucus to serve – Representatives Jim Banks of Indiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Rodney Davis of Illinois, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Troy Nehls of Texas.

Pelosi rejected Banks and Jordan because she said their 'statements and actions' would compromise the 'integrity of the investigation.'

Both pro-Trump lawmakers voted against certifying the election results in at least one state on January 6, 2021 – but so did Nehls and Pelosi did not reject him as a pick for the panel.

In response to Pelosi, McCarthy entirely boycotted the investigation and barred his party from engaging in the select committee.

Pelosi, however, found two anti-Trump Republicans willing to go against their party and join the panel in Representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.

Pelosi picked anti-Trump Republican Representatives Liz Cheney (left) and Adam Kinzinger (right) to serve on the committee in the absence of any other GOP members willing to break with Leader McCarthy

In response, the Republican National Committee and Wyoming GOP censured Cheney, and she was booted from her No. 3 party post as chairwoman for the GOP Conference. She was replaced with Representative Elise Stefanik of New York.

Cheney is highly likely to lose reelection for her at-large seat to the Trump-backed candidate Harriet Hageman while Kinzinger is not running for another term.

'I think it would've been far better to have Republicans [on the panel],' Trump told Punchbowl, adding that Banks and Jordan were 'great' selections by McCarthy.

'They were great and would've been great to have them,' he said. 'But when Pelosi wrongfully didn't allow them, we should've picked other people. We have a lot of good people in the Republican Party.'

He added that there's 'not even a question' McCarthy should have put Republicans on the select committee.

Trump does not consider Cheney and Kinzinger true Republicans – calling them and other anti-Trump GOP members 'RINOs', which means Republicans in Name Only.

McCarthy doesn't think that Pelosi should have the ability to decide which members of his committee can sit on committees.

'We're never letting Nancy Pelosi select who's on our committee,' McCarthy said in an interview Tuesday.

'The whole narrative shows it's all partisan,' he added. 'This whole thing was about politics.'

Kevin McCarthy decided his party would boycott the investigation to make it seem like a one-sided, one-party witch hunt after Pelosi rejected his picks for the select committee. 'We're never letting Nancy Pelosi select who's on our committee,' McCarthy said Tuesday. 'The whole narrative shows it's all partisan. This whole thing was about politics'

Pelosi would not allow GOP Representatives Jim Jordan (left) and Jim Banks (right) onto the committee because she said their 'statements and actions' would compromise the 'integrity of the investigation'

'We said we'd participate in this,' McCarthy said of the investigation into the events surrounding and on the day of January 6, 2021. 'We put who we wanted up on it. But the only people who can be put on it are people that she's approved. That's never going to happen. It's pure politics.'

The January 6 select committee is two weeks into its hearings, holding four so far.

McCarthy felt that by Republicans sitting out he could paint the proceedings as a one-sided 'witch hunt' – even with the presence of Cheney and Kinzinger.

Other Republicans are quietly starting to wonder if it would have been better if they had a seat at the table.

The committee is likely to hold at least four more hearings in coming weeks to conclude making the case that Donald Trump knew he lost the 2020 presidential election but still pushed the 'Big Lie', and that his actions – and lack of actions – ultimately led to the deadly Capitol riot.",Q2

He wanted Oklahoma to be “the most pro-life state in the country,” which was in part why the state’s new ban included no exceptions for rape or incest.

Within 48 hours of the leak, Republicans in Louisiana advanced a bill that would classify abortion as homicide and allow prosecutors to criminally charge patients, not just abortion providers. Though the bill would ultimately be scrapped, its supporters vowed that they would continue to push for “what’s right.”

And by the weekend, state GOP lawmakers were openly questioning forms of birth control, including the Plan B pill, a widely used form of emergency contraception often provided to rape victims.

What had been a slow, deliberate erosion of abortion rights over the 50 years since the court’s ruling in Roe now seemed to be a flash flood of increasingly severe restrictions and proposals cropping up at the state level, abortion rights advocates say, as antiabortion Republicans envision a post-Roe world.

“I think these state lawmakers are feeling emboldened based on what they think is coming down the pike from the Supreme Court,” said Rachel Fey, who works on policy programs for Power to Decide, a nonprofit organization that seeks to prevent unplanned pregnancies and supports abortion rights.

“We are in uncharted territory,” Fey added. “In my 20 years in health and reproductive justice, I’ve never seen … such a plethora of extreme, extreme attacks, and that’s really saying something.”

Such concerns have largely been dismissed as alarmist by abortion foes, who say they are not focused on doing away with things like birth control — but who themselves are divided over what would come next if Roe is overturned.

After heated debate Thursday, GOP lawmakers in Louisiana stripped language out of their bill that would have criminally charged abortion patients with homicide, revealing a split within the antiabortion movement. State Rep. Danny McCormick (R), the bill’s sponsor, argued that a fetus must be granted the same protections as a person, while other Republicans urged caution, emphasizing that the antiabortion movement does not support imposing criminal charges on people who are pregnant.

The antiabortion movement turned away from punishing abortion patients because the public does not support those measures, said Mary Ziegler, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School who specializes in the history of abortion. According to a recent Monmouth University poll, nearly two-thirds of Americans support keeping abortion legal, either always or with some limitations. An additional 26 percent said it should be illegal with exceptions for rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. Only 8 percent said they thought abortion should always be illegal.

But there was no question that the prospect of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision guaranteeing a right to abortion, had energized Louisiana Republicans despite prevailing public sentiment. While 12 other states have introduced similar legislation granting full constitutional protections to a fetus from the moment an egg is fertilized, Louisiana’s bill was the first to move out of a committee, said Bradley Pierce, the executive director of the Foundation to Abolish Abortion, who helped draft the Louisiana measure.

Once the Supreme Court’s decision is final, Pierce said, he expects more penalties for people seeking abortions, no matter how those laws might be viewed by the public.

“Ultimately it’s not an issue of doing what’s popular. It’s an issue of doing what’s right,” Pierce said.

If Roe is overturned, “trigger laws” banning abortion would go into effect in 13 Republican-led states. Most of the recent abortion bans proposed by Republican-led state legislatures include no exceptions for rape or incest, and more GOP lawmakers and candidates are defending their support for comprehensive bans.

J.D. Vance, the Republican nominee for Senate in Ohio, called rape and incest “inconvenient” but said he still did not support any exceptions to an abortion ban.

“Two wrongs don’t make a right,” Vance told Spectrum News. “The question to me is really about the baby.”

Questioned about the lack of exceptions for rape or incest, Stitt told Fox News on Sunday: “That is a human being inside the womb. … We’re going to do everything we can to protect life and love both the mother and the child. And we don’t think that killing one to protect another is the right thing to do either.”

Those exceptions are actually not the norm, said Elizabeth Nash, a principal policy associate for state issues at the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights think tank. Since 2013, 10 states have passed six-week abortion bans, but only one of those states, South Carolina, included exceptions for rape or incest.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who supports abortion restrictions but who has spoken out in the past about being a victim of rape, said that she had pushed for those exceptions in South Carolina’s law and urged other Republicans to do the same.

“When you realize what’s happened in your life, the trauma, the emotional, the mental, the physical trauma in a woman’s life, that decision — she should make that decision with her doctor and between her and her God,” Mace said.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) has also expressed uneasiness about his state’s ban, which makes exceptions for women facing medical emergencies but not for rape or incest cases.

The debate over rape and incest exceptions has played out on the floor of several statehouses this year. As Florida considered its 15-week abortion ban in March, which passed without exceptions for rape and incest, Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book (D), delivered an emotional speech on the subject, sharing her own story of sexual assault: At age 13, she said, her nanny brought her to a party, where she was drugged and raped by several men.

She urged her colleagues to consider an amendment that would add the exceptions to the bill.

“I am begging you, for little Lauren, for me. … I am asking you to give those survivors more time to heal,” she said as she addressed the chamber.

Since the leaked Supreme Court decision, several Republican lawmakers have also signaled their willingness to restrict emergency contraception in addition to abortion, a subject legislators have rarely discussed in public.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) recently refused to rule out the possibility that his state would ban certain forms of contraception. Several Republican lawmakers and candidates for elected office have openly questioned Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 Supreme Court case that granted married couples access to contraception without government restrictions — and that undergirds Roe and other decisions.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) has called the Griswold decision “legally unsound.” Blake Masters, a GOP Senate candidate in Arizona, says on his website he would “vote only for federal judges who understand that Roe and Griswold and Casey were wrongly decided.” Both have denied that they want to ban contraception.

The architects of the Louisiana bill, before it was scuttled late Thursday, also originally intended for it to extend to emergency contraception like Plan B, according to Pierce, the abortion opponent behind the measure.

The day after the Supreme Court draft opinion leaked, President Biden drew the line from a possible overturning of Roe v. Wade to the potential undermining of Griswold and other decisions related to privacy.

“In my view, if it becomes a law and if what is written is what remains, it goes far beyond the concern of whether or not there is the right to choose. It goes to other basic rights: the right to marry, the right to determine a whole range of things,” Biden said on May 3. “I think the decision in Griswold was correct overruling; I think the decision in Roe was correct, because there’s a right to privacy. There can be limitations on it, but it cannot be denied.”

Within the antiabortion movement, leaders have been quick to steer the conversation away from contraception.

“That’s just not our focus,” said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, a leading antiabortion organization. While she would eventually support restrictions on Plan B, Hawkins said the movement needs to end abortion first.

“Our focus now in the post-Roe world is on chemical abortion,” she said, referring to abortion pills.

Abortion rights groups are using contraception as a “scare tactic,” Hawkins said. By telling people they could lose access to birth control, she added, abortion rights leaders are hoping to mobilize more people on the Supreme Court’s draft decision.

But abortion rights activists who have sought to broaden access to contraception say it is not out of the realm of possibility for Republicans to target contraception next if Roe falls.

“I don’t think folks are being alarmist,” said Power to Decide’s Fey. “We have seen a long and continued assault on contraceptive access for many years at the federal level and at the state level.”

In Texas, for example, those covered by the state Medicaid program are not allowed to receive contraception from any clinic that provides abortion care or that could be affiliated with one that does. Missouri lawmakers last year attempted to exclude coverage for IUDs and emergency contraception from their Medicaid program, an effort that ultimately failed.

Under the Trump administration, programs receiving federal funding via Title X were prohibited from even mentioning abortion, leading to hundreds of clinics leaving the program — which meant far fewer places for uninsured people to obtain contraception and other health services.

And more generally, Fey added, state policymakers and governors now frequently mischaracterize certain methods of contraception as abortifacients — either intentionally or because they are not clear on how they work.

Fey said she and other advocates will continue to fight for access to abortion and contraception, but added that it was “heartbreaking” that it took the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion for many people to pay attention to the threats to Roe.

“I’m perpetually angry that it has to be such a fight for something so core to how people plan and build their families,” she said.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision next month. Some Republicans are looking beyond the court ruling.

Idaho state Rep. Brent Crane (R), chairman of the House State Affairs Committee that oversees abortion legislation, said last week that while Idaho’s current Republican caucus did not support penalizing people who are pregnant, that may change in the future if the court overturns Roe.

“We’re going to probably see 30 new individuals come into the House of Representatives next year,” he said. “It will be interesting to see the impact that this decision will have on those individuals.”

Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) said Sunday on CNN that if the court overturns Roe, he would call a special session of the legislature to impose a total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.

“I believe life begins at conception,” he said. “And those are babies too.”",Q2
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/05/01/activists-self-immolation-stirs-questions-on-faith/,Activist’s self-immolation stirs questions on faith,"Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old climate activist and Buddhist, set himself on fire in front of the US Supreme Court last week, prompting a national conversation about his motivation and whether he may have been inspired by Buddhist monks who self-immolated in the past to protest government atrocities.

Bruce, a photographer from Boulder, Colorado, walked up to the plaza of the Supreme Court around 6:30 p.m. Friday—on Earth Day—then sat down and set himself ablaze, a law enforcement official said. Supreme Court police officers responded immediately but were unable to extinguish the blaze in time to save him.

Investigators, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said they did not immediately locate a manifesto or note at the scene and that officials were still working to determine a motive.

On Saturday, Kritee Kanko, a Zen Buddhist priest who described herself as Bruce’s friend, shared an emotional post on her public Twitter account saying his self-immolation was “not suicide” but “a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis.”

She added that Bruce had been planning the act for at least a year. She wrote: “#wynnbruce I am so moved.” She got sympathetic responses as well as backlash.

Kanko and other members of the Rocky Mountain Ecodharma Retreat Center in Boulder, released a statement Monday saying “none of the Buddhist teachers in the Boulder area knew about (Bruce’s) plans to self-immolate on this Earth Day,” and that had they known about his plan, they would have stopped him. Bruce was a frequent visitor to the Buddhist retreat center in the mountains near Boulder where he meditated with the community, Kanko said.

“We have never talked about self-immolation, and we do not think self-immolation is a climate action,” the statement said. “Nevertheless, given the dire state of the planet and worsening climate crisis, we understand why someone might do that.”

On Facebook, Bruce wrote about following the spiritual tradition of Shambhala, which combines Tibetan Buddhism with the principles of living “an uplifted life, fully engaged with the world,” according to the Boulder Shambhala Center. Bruce also posted praise for Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, a leader of engaged Buddhism, around the time of his death in January.

Bruce’s act of sitting down and setting himself on fire was reminiscent of the events of June 11, 1963, when Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese monk, seated cross-legged, burned himself to death at a busy Saigon intersection. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government led by Ngo Dinh Diem, a staunch Catholic.

In a letter to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whom Hanh counted as a friend, Hanh wrote that he drew inspiration from the Vietnamese monk’s self-sacrifice, saying: “To burn oneself by fire is to prove what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity.”

In Tibet, anti-Chinese activists have employed self-immolation as a form of protest. The International Campaign for Tibet says 131 men and 28 women—monks, nuns and laypeople among them—have self-immolated since 2009 to protest against Beijing’s strict controls over the region and their religion.

Buddhism as a religion does not unilaterally condone the act of self-immolation or taking one’s life, said Robert Barnett, a London-based researcher of modern Tibetan history and politics.

“Killing yourself is considered damaging in Buddhism because life is precious,” he said. “But if a person self-immolates because of a higher motivation and it’s not out of a negative emotion such as depression or sadness, then the Buddhist position becomes far more complex.”

If self-immolation is done to help the world, it might be accepted as a positive action, Barnett said. He cited a story from the “Jataka Tales,” a body of South Asian literature concerning the prior incarnations of the Buddha in human and animal form. In that particular tale, an incarnation of the Buddha, in an act of selfless compassion, offers himself to an emaciated tigress who was so hungry that she was ready to devour her own cubs.

“But that kind of self-sacrifice is not encouraged, developed or talked about for normal people (other than the Buddha),” he said, adding that this is because of “the immense difficulty of cultivating positive motivation in any situation, let alone maintaining it under stress or in conditions of extreme pain.”

Buddhism emphasizes emotional balance, inclusiveness, kindness, compassion and wisdom, said Roshi Joan Halifax, an environmental activist and abbot of the Upaya Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

“What we’re seeing today among many people is hopelessness,” she said. “What we are called to do is not to be disabled by that sense of futility, but to transform our moral suffering into wise hope and courageous action.”

Despite the pessimism that some climate activists may feel, there is reason to remain hopeful, Halifax said.

“You see that people are waking up to the magnitude of the climate catastrophe,” she said, noting that countries and corporations are moving away from damaging practices and toward clean energy.

“I feel inspired and hopeful by our ability to change and adapt in this ever-changing world,” she said. “My heart is heavy that (Bruce) did not have that kind of optimism.”

Those who knew Bruce saw a man who was kind, playful and idealistic—an avid dancer who participated in weekly events. He was also known for biking and embracing public transportation.

Bharath reported from Los Angeles and Slevin from Denver. Associated Press writer Michael Balsamo in Washington D.C. and researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York also contributed.

Bruce, who enjoyed the outdoors, brought an intensity to whatever he did, said his friend Jeffry Buechler. On Buechler’s wedding day in 2014, Bruce, on a whim, decided to go for a dip in a cold mountain lake early in the morning, he said.

Bruce also suffered lasting effects from a brain injury he sustained in a car wreck that killed his best friend about 30 years ago, Buechler said.

Marco DeGaetano, who met Bruce in the 1990s when they both attended a Universalist church in Denver, said “Wynn seemed to have an affinity for people who needed help.”

He recalled Bruce being kind to a church member with a mental illness when others distanced themselves.

DeGaetano said he last saw Bruce about a month ago, and he seemed outgoing and friendly as always—every time he saw Bruce, “he had a smile on his face.”

https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/2022-06-01/a-rare-visit-by-pakistanis-to-israel-has-caused-furor-in-islamabad,A rare visit by Pakistanis to Israel has caused furor in Islamabad,"Updated June 2, 2022 at 10:13 AM ET

JERUSALEM — ""THIS PASSPORT IS VALID FOR ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD EXCEPT ISRAEL,"" reads the phrase on every Pakistani passport.

But there was Fishel BenKhald, one of Pakistan's few Jews, gripping that passport in front of the Western Wall, the revered Jewish prayer site in Jerusalem —

""the land where my heart and my soul is connected to,"" he says.

He arrived in Israel in early May with a rare visit of 15 mostly Pakistani Americans, who traveled on their U.S. passports but who hold close ties in their home country. The trip was organized by an American Muslim women's activist group, and sponsored by an Israeli organization seeking to expand Israel's ties with Muslim-majority countries.

/ Daniel Estrin / Daniel Estrin Pakistan indicates its passport cannot be used for entry into Israel.

The trip drew little attention from Israelis and Palestinians, but it stirred fury in Pakistan, where opposition politicians including ousted ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan saw it as a secretive opening gambit to end their country's official boycott of Israel. Pakistanis were especially angered that a talk show host from state-run television, whom Khan's supporters claimed is close to Pakistan's military, was on the trip. He was subsequently fired.

""The good news,"" Ahmed Quraishi, the TV journalist, says about the Israel trip and subsequent controversy, is ""we today have the first, robust and rich nationwide debate in Pakistan on establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. This is huge.""

Pakistan's senate on Monday passed a resolution confirming its stance against Israel. A senator called for a ban on the organization that spearheaded the trip, the American Muslim and Multifaith Women's Empowerment Council. Some in Pakistan called to strip the expats who traveled to Israel of their Pakistani citizenship.

""This is the price Muslim American Pakistani women have to pay for peace building,"" the group's co-founder, Anila Ali, told NPR.

The anger in Pakistan surged after Israeli President Isaac Herzog spoke publicly about his private meeting with the Pakistani and Pakistani American delegation at his residence in Jerusalem in early May.

""I must say, this was an amazing experience, because we haven't had a group of Pakistani leaders in Israel ever, on such scope,"" Herzog said about the civil society activists before an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""That all stemmed from the Abraham Accords.""

Why Pakistan boycotts Israel

Pakistan officially refuses to forge diplomatic ties with Israel until Palestinians get an independent state. That's long been the case for many Muslim-majority countries. But in 2020, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain established relations with Israel and signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords. Morocco and Sudan have since joined in, and there has been constant speculation among Pakistanis about whether their country might follow suit.

Pakistan and Israel have long held quiet dialogues on military and security matters — both are nuclear powers — and their respective foreign ministers met publicly in 2005.

""I cannot tell you that Pakistan ... is the next state to join the Abraham Accords and that it's going to happen tomorrow,"" Israeli Intelligence Minister Elazar Stern told NPR. ""We hope that every moderate Muslim state, country, in the Middle East will join.""

Israel's focus is more on Saudi Arabia than Pakistan

President Biden's anticipated visit to Israel this month has prompted hopes in the country that a new U.S.-brokered normalization deal could be in the works. Israel has set its sights on Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam's top holy sites and a heavyweight in the region.

/ Sharaka / Sharaka A delegation of Pakistani American and Pakistani interfaith activists meets with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in the president's official residence in Jerusalem.

Israeli media report the U.S. is currently mediating talks for what could become a first public Israeli-Saudi agreement over the status of two Red Sea islands where Israeli ships pass.

""The next stage in the Abraham Accords, in normalization, needs to be normalization with Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told Israel Army Radio on Monday. ""It's a long, cautious process from both sides.""

Though Pakistan is often influenced by its ally Saudi Arabia, the odds today appear stacked against normal relations between Israel and Pakistan.

Many Pakistanis incorporate a Palestinian flag in their social media profiles, and protests against Israel flare up in Pakistan whenever there is an Israeli military escalation with Palestinians. As Pakistan lurches from one political crisis to another, one stance that would almost certainly unite most Pakistanis is opposition to relations with Israel.

There is also deep-seated antisemitism in Pakistan. It is fairly normal in political discourse for events to be blamed on Jews or Jewish conspiracies; the former foreign minister made antisemitic comments on CNN last May.

Geopolitically, Pakistan doesn't have the same concerns about Iran — its nuclear program and its support for militant activities in the Middle East — that drove Pakistan's Gulf neighbors toward Israel.

""If Iran is not the main issue for them, what can they gain?"" Eyal Zisser, a Middle East expert at Tel Aviv University, says about Pakistan. ""Why should they risk themselves in terms of, you know, the public opinion there?""

But Sharaka, the Israeli group that sponsored the delegation to Israel, says both current and former Pakistani officials acquiesced to BenKhald's participation in the Israel trip.

""I would be shocked if this will be the last delegation of Pakistanis, or Pakistani Americans, to Israel,"" says Elie Pieprz, Sharaka's director of international affairs.

Fawad Chaudhry, the former information minister under Khan's government, would not confirm Pakistan gave a green light. ""Our policy is absolutely no recognition or engagement with Israel until establishment of state of Palestine,"" said in a text message to NPR.

Is it a trial balloon?

""It's an open secret that [the Pakistani] establishment has very close ties to the Gulf states,"" says Raza Rumi, director of the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College in New York, and the editor of the liberal Pakistani outlet Naya Daur. ""There must be some debate going on, and this visit was just a testing-the-waters-type visit.""

It may seem that a small interfaith group would have little influence on a country's foreign policy. But such trips can serve as a trial balloon.

An interfaith delegation of Sunni and Shiite Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus and Sikhs from Bahrain made an unprecedented visit to Jerusalem in late 2017, three years before Bahrain established diplomatic relations with Israel.

The Pakistani American delegation visited Tel Aviv, toured Israel's Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, and were guided by a Palestinian tour guide at the Al Aqsa Mosque, central in Islam.

""It is such a blessing to be here in Masjid Al Aqsa. The best moment of my life,"" says Pakistani American Rana Seyd, fighting back tears after her visit to the religious site. ""It's very true that on a Pakistani passport I couldn't have traveled. But that is why I prayed here, that may Allah please guide each one of us to be friends.""

BenKhald, who lives in Karachi and runs a Jewish kosher certification business for food manufacturers exporting their products abroad, hopes his country will end its official boycott of Israel to get help with Pakistan's water crisis. Israel is a parched country that transformed itself into a water technology powerhouse.

""We need that, not after 50 years, no, in the next 15 years, we are requiring that,"" he says.

A chance encounter with an official from another country with tense relations

The Pakistani American activist who helped organize the visit is Ali, the California-based co-founder of the American Muslim and Multifaith Women's Empowerment Council.

""Whenever I've spoken to politicians, and behind closed doors, they'll say, 'You know, we don't have a problem with Israel.' They also say, 'We don't have a problem with Jews.' But then, when you're a politician, that's it, you use that rhetoric. You use the rhetoric to divide,"" she says. ""We must, as people say, 'We don't want you to use that.'""

Last month, she stood with the delegation in front of the Western Wall when suddenly a visiting dignitary arrived from another country at odds with Pakistan.

Indian Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar was in Jerusalem to sign a water technology agreement with Israel. The activists lined up in front of him, and Ali, who counts her family among Pakistan's founding leadership when the country separated from India in 1947, asked the Indian minister to deliver a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""We pray that India and Pakistan make peace and we share Allah's resources,"" she said. ""Water is important for Pakistanis and important for the Indians. So let's all pray for that.""

She proposed India and Pakistan embrace each other, like India has embraced Israel.

The response from the Indian minister was a polite smile.

https://www.dw.com/en/pakistani-trans-activists-to-appeal-sharia-court-ruling/a-65687320,Pakistani trans activists to appeal Sharia court ruling – DW – 05,"Transgender activists in Pakistan plan to appeal to the highest court against an Islamic court that overturned the country's 2018 laws protecting transgender rights such as legal gender recognition.

Transgender activists in Pakistan said on Saturday they plan to launch a Supreme Court challenge against a ruling by Pakistan's religious judiciary, which deemed various transgender legal protections un-Islamic and therefore void.

On Friday, the Federal Shariat Court — which determines whether laws accord to Islam — struck down three sections of a 2018 act hailed for providing landmark rights to the transgender community.

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act was passed by Parliament in 2018 to secure the rights of transgender Pakistanis. It ensures their access to legal gender recognition, among other rights.

The 2018 rules were strikingly moderate for the Islamic country, considering that Pakistan also does not recognize same-sex marriage and outlaws sex between men with the possibility of prison terms, among other restrictions.

What did the Sharia court decide?

The Federal Shariat Court struck down several provisions of the landmark law, terming them ""un-Islamic."" It ruled that a person cannot change their gender on the basis of ""innermost feeling"" or ""self-perceived identity"" and must conform to the biological sex assigned to them at birth.

It rejected a clause in the law in which the country's national database and registration authority permits the change of a person's biological gender from the one they were assigned at birth in identification documents including drivers' licenses and passports.

The court also ruled that the term ""transgender"" as it is used in the law creates confusion. It covers several biological variations, including intersex, transgender men, transgender women and Khawaja Sira, a Pakistani term commonly used for those who were born male but identify as female.

The judges said a section of the 2018 act outlawing transgender discrimination risks ""the right to privacy of females in our society"".

""This law will pave the way for criminals in society to easily commit crimes like sexual molestation, sexual assault and even rape against females,"" the finding said.

However, the court said Islamic law recognizes the existence of intersex people and eunuchs and said they should be entitled to all the fundamental rights provided to Pakistanis in the constitution.

What was the reaction?

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed dismay over the ""regressive ruling"" and said the denial of transgender people's rights to self-perceived gender identity seeks the ""erasure of an entire demographic and its fundamental rights.""

It said rolling back the transgender bill would lead to further marginalization and abuse of an already vulnerable community in Pakistan.

Amnesty International called on the government to stop any attempts to prevent transgender people from obtaining official documents reflecting their gender identity without complying with abusive and invasive requirements.

""This verdict is a blow to the rights of the already beleaguered group of transgender and gender-diverse people in Pakistan,"" said Rehab Mahamoor, research assistant at Amnesty International, in a statement.

Violence against transgender people in Pakistan

""This decision will further increase the incidents of violence against transgender people,"" said Shahzadi Rai, of the Gender Interactive Alliance and Sindh province's trans pride Moorat March organisation.

""Transgender people will be pushed further against the wall in society,"" Rai said in a statement after the Supreme Court legal challenge was announced at Karachi Press Club.

Many Pakistanis have entrenched beliefs on gender and sexuality and transgender people are often considered outcasts. Some are forced into begging, dancing and even prostitution to earn money. They also live in fear of attacks.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 19 trans people were murdered in Pakistan last year and accused the state of getting ""cold feet"" over community protections.

https://wjimam.com/the-best-small-town-bar-in-michigan-is/,The Best Small Town Bar In Michigan Is…,"...somewhere you've never been...I'm almost sure of it... Is there anything better than drinking in a small town bar? Where you feel like your eavesdropping on local conversations because everybody knows each other so well?

Well, the thrillist.com has dropped a list of the best small town bars in every state, and the one they've listed for Michigan could very well be the best. Except it's in such a remote region of the state, I'm not sure if there's a way we can check on it.

What makes me angry about it, is I've been by this place six or seven times in my life and never bothered to stop by for a beer.

The best small town bat in Michigan is...

Fitzgerald's In Eagle River.

Situated along beautiful M-26 (seriously, if you think M-22 is the shizznit, you really need to go way north), Eagle River hugs the rocks along lake Superior between Hancock and the stunning Copper Harbor in the most remote reaches of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan's northernmost county.

Here's what Thrillist has to say about Fitz's place.

Located deep enough in the northern region of the Upper Peninsula Keweenaw Peninsula -- a gorgeous, Lake Superior-engulfed place buried in snow for much of the year and perched so far north that even the most avid Michigan travelers might get a nosebleed -- the Fitz serves up great BBQ to go along with the requisite whitefish, but despite its designation as a restaurant, it might also be the best place to drink with a view of a Great Lake period. That's thanks to the owner's obsession with Michigan's immaculate craft beer scene, with more than 100 local (and not-so-local) brews on offer, perfect for sipping with a view of the mighty lake. In addition to being one of Michigan's greatest undiscovered beer bars, they also have a deep love of whiskey, with 90+ bottles on offer and a staff loaded with knowledge about each. And yeah, you can snowmobile there in the winter, but the real move here is to book a room at the adjoining Eagle River Inn and bask in the magnificent sunsets on a tiny slice of heaven, beer in hand and surrounded by travelers and locals whose only real worries are which beer to get next.

So next time you're in Eagle River (year round population 71), stop in to Fitz's and say 'Hi'. I'm pretty sure they whole town will be there.",Q2
https://www.newschannel5.com/news/roe-vs-wade-tennessee-state-leaders-and-the-fear-contraceptives-could-be-banned,Roe Vs. Wade: Tennessee state leaders and the fear contraceptives could be banned,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — With the chance the U.S. Supreme Court may overturn Roe Vs. Wade, some fear Tennessee Republicans could try to ban contraceptives.

Top state leaders faced questions about the idea this week.

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton briefly addressed the ideas on NewsChannel 5's Inside Politics.

""I think oral contraceptives are fine,"" said Speaker Sexton.

Gov. Bill Lee also addressed reporters' questions about concerns on Thursday.

""There is no law on our books that deals with contraception, emergency contraception. I do not know of any plans for such.""

State Democrats point out the responses don't address whether or not the Republicans would be opposed to banning certain forms of contraception.

""People are concerned, especially about the Plan B pill and the IUDs, and there are arguments that people try to make against those types of contraceptives,"" said Knoxville Rep. Gloria Johnson.

Any such ideas would have to wait until either a special session or until the next general assembly begins in 2023.

Rep. Johnson said her fears haven't been silenced by Republicans on the issue.

Johnson said when Republicans propose controversial bills, they often don't talk about them first.

""There are a lot of bills that came up that they told no one about, and they just popped up. I can't trust what they say because I've known what their actions have been,"" she said.

If conservatives in the state decided the wanted to ban certain contraceptives, they have a lot of power to do so. The Republican supermajority is currently 75% of the state legislature and with a Republican governor, there's not much to stop their priorities.

Pro-choice rallies are expected this Saturday as a result of the leaked Supreme Court decision.",Q2
https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/with-historic-firsts-abounding-senate-oks-jackson-for-high-court/,"With historic firsts abounding, Senate OKs Jackson for High Court","NAACP graphic celebrating the senate confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the High Court. | AP

WASHINGTON—With historic firsts abounding, including the nation’s first-ever Black and woman Vice President in the chair, senators confirmed the nation’s first-ever Black woman Supreme Court justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the High Court bench.

And the 53-47 vote for Jackson marks yet several more historic firsts, as both senators and advocates for her nomination pointed out. One other notable first: A roar of cheers and applause in the sedate Senate chamber when VP Kamala Harris announced the tally’s result.

“This has taken far too long,” NAACP President Derrick Jackson said in a statement, one of a long list of comments on the historic event of the day.

Barely able to conceal her joy, Mariah Watson, a third-year law student at Harvard Law said, “She showed it can be done. Even after having to work twice as hard to achieve this great victory, she did it.” Watson said, “Judge, I mean Justice Brown, has inspired us all.” She told an MSNBC reporter last night how Judge Brown regularly went back to her law school to talk with and inspire students.

“Fifty-five years ago, former NAACP Chief Counsel Thurgood Marshall broke down the wall when he was confirmed as the first Black American to sit on the Supreme Court. Today, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson shatters the glass ceiling to finally make room for a Black woman on our nation’s highest court,” Derrick Johnson said yesterday.

Black women gathered for a joyful demonstration outside the court as the vote occurred on April 7, and sponsoring groups, including the Service Employees and AFSCME, planned a mass late-afternoon rally today to celebrate.

Besides being the first Black woman in the court’s 233-year history, another first Jackson will bring when she officially takes the oath of office on July 1 is the end of the white-male majority on the nine-justice bench.

When the court starts its new term, with Justice Jackson, next fall, the court will have four white men—all nominated by Republican presidents—four women, and one Black man, Clarence Thomas.

And while one conservative, Chief Justice John Roberts, and five right-wingers will hold ideological sway, the three-woman minority on the court will be Black (Jackson), Latina (Sonia Sotomayor), and Jewish (Elena Kagan). The fourth woman is Donald Trump-named white Amy Coney Barrett.

Jackson will also be the first Floridian native ever on the court, its first former public defender, the first former trial court judge since Justice Sotomayor, the first former defense attorney since Justice Marshall, and the first-ever former magazine reporter and journalist. She wrote for Time in 1992-93.

Unions and civil rights groups hailed the historic nature of Jackson’s ascension from her current post on the U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. The one wrench thrown into the celebrations was the partisan nature of the Senate vote. Republicans Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to join all 48 Democrats and both independents in voting for Judge Jackson.

When the Democrats stood in sustained applause lasting a minute after Vice President Harris announced the results only Romney joined them in standing up to applaud. All the other Republicans unceremoniously left the hall, not one able to bring themselves to at least recognize the historic accomplishment that had just been achieved.

AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler—the first-ever woman to lead the nation’s leading labor confederation—called Jackson’s confirmation “a victory for our democracy and our nation.” It marks “a new era for our country,” she stated.

Judge Jackson “personified grace and integrity in the face of many outrageous attacks on her character and impeccable credentials. Judge Jackson has the experience, temperament, and commitment to ensure the judicial fairness we need in an associate justice. Her intellect, legal knowledge, and record of upholding justice under the law will be invaluable as she makes decisions that directly impact the lives of working people, and champions equal rights.

“Judge Jackson’s life story and the milestone she has reached send a potent message to women and girls across this nation that nothing—not even a seat on our highest court—is out of their reach.

The federation listed similar cheers from a wide range of unions: The Communications Workers, the Auto Workers, the Office and Professional Employees, AFA-CWA, the Steelworkers, IATSE, the Professional and Technical Employees, the Amalgamated Transit Union, the Teachers (AFT), the Machinists, Actor’s Equity, the Government Employees (AFGE), and AFSCME.

“Justice Jackson is immensely qualified, and our coalition is thrilled to finally see the first Black woman serve on our nation’s highest court. By any standard, Justice Jackson is more than ready for this role,” said Wade Henderson, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights—even after LCCHR, in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, sharply criticized the blatant political posturing and lies some members produced during the panel’s confirmation hearings on her nomination.

“She possesses an exemplary record of defending the rights of all people, from her time as a public defender to her years of service as a district and circuit court judge. The Supreme Court has a long way to go toward fully representing our communities and fulfilling the promise of ‘equal justice under law,’ but this confirmation brings us hope that it is possible.

The other 47 Senate Republicans voted “no,” and their attitude was even worse, Henderson wrote the panel. It tied on partisan lines, 11-11, on her nomination. CWA also criticized Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the rest of the GOP for trying to derail the nomination.

LCCHR didn’t name names, but the nastiest attacks came from three white male extremist Republicans who plan presidential runs: Ted Cruz (Texas), Tom Cotton (Arkansas), and Josh Hawley (Missouri), an instigator of the Trumpite mob that invaded the Capitol for an attempted coup on Jan. 6, 2021.

“The attacks on Judge Jackson’s record grossly mischaracterize her work and threaten the ideals of our democracy,” LCCHR wrote. “Despite these inappropriate and knowingly misleading attacks, Judge Jackson showed a poised and patient judicial temperament, reminding senators that constitutional protections are not privileges reserved for a select few, but rights afforded to us all. This is a much-needed perspective on our highest court.

“With no basis upon which to honestly question Judge Jackson’s impressive qualifications, some senators made false statements about Judge Jackson’s sentencing practices in a sad and transparent attempt to derail her path to confirmation.

“Attacks on Judge Jackson for her zealous defense of her clients, including her defense of clients detained at Guantanamo Bay, are misguided attempts to score political points while undermining the fundamental right to counsel,” it added.

A bitter Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell turned his back on his celebrating colleagues and walked out of the chamber with everyone in his unhappy caucus following him. McConnell later vowed, in an interview with a reporter, to again discard the Constitution if Republicans should take back the Senate this year. His plan, in that case, would be to block any nominations from coming to the floor, as he did when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland. The Constitution assigns the filling of Supreme Court seats to the president with the “advice and consent” of the Senate. It says nothing about the Senate having the power to keep Court vacancies open until the Senate Majority leader gets a president he likes.",Q2

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/responding-to-the-divorce-where-one-9574153/,Responding To The Divorce Where One Spouse Is Ready To “Burn Down The (Financial) House.”,"Extreme times produce irrational responses. A day ago, an unhappy orthopedic patient in Oklahoma decided it was time to kill his surgeon. He took three other lives as well as these people got “in his way.”

We are seeing this kind of irrational and largely self destructive conduct in the domestic world was well. A few weeks ago, the Superior Court decided a case where the books and records of the business were so bizarre that no sense could be made of them. In an odd twist the Superior Court remanded the case out of concern that the party who kept the books may have been treated unfairly. Snyder v. Snyder (April 20, 2022)

The non-precedential Crimi case, decided on May 25 follows a similar theme. The Crimis married in 1992 and separated 21 years later in 2013. Husband filed for divorce in 2017 according to the court’s opinion although the docket number still carries a 2009 number when there had been an earlier filing.

The parties had an antique business called Best of France, Inc. Husband owned 90%; wife 10%. Curiously, while the matter was pending Husband closed Best of France and then re-opened as Edmondo Crimi, LLC. He did that in April 2019.

We mentioned that the case had a 2009 filing number. While informing us that the 2009 case was withdrawn in August 2010 (fn. 1) the trial court opinion described a 2014 order by which the parties agreed that inventories of the then existing Best of France assets would be performed and photos of the antiques taken, quaintly, to preserve the facts “in amber.” This apparently did occur as wife introduced her inventory and the photos during the trial in 2021.

Five months after the divorce was filed (or perhaps better put “resumed”) the parties were back in court in June 2017 where the court ordered husband to provide wife with a revised/current inventory and wife was to account for what she had “taken” from the business. The order was ignored so the parties returned for another hearing where the judge re-ordered them to do what she said and to update the business inventory monthly. We don’t know whether either order was complied with; only that the matter meandered on to a non-record master’s hearing in late Summer 2020. Note well, that somehow, someway, the business called Best of France was closed by husband in April 2019 and re-constituted in his name as an LLC. As one might expect the master’s recommendation was appealed and a trial de novo was scheduled.

After several days of trial over several months in earl 2021 the trial court directed husband to $836,394 as “equitable reimbursement alimony” in 6 annual installments of $139,399. Husband appealed.

The core of the appeal is husband’s contention that the trial court divided the business assets while ignoring $3,329,000 in business debt, almost half of which was due to one individual. As one might expect that individual professed to have a secured interest in the inventory of antiques. At trial husband argued the business (Best of France or Crimi LLC?) was worth negative ($1,000,000). Wife said the business was worth $2,100,000. Thus, a $3 million delta in values.

While telling us that there was no separation until 2013, the trial court concludes that husband began in 2012 to gut the value of the business by taking loans from someone named Chance Worthington. Wife professed to have no knowledge of these loans. The trial court opines that as a shareholder wife had to be informed of the debt and consent to it. It also notes that in 2017 while the parties were fussing over inventories husband settled a lawsuit brought by another antique dealer by borrowing money from Chance Worthington and granting him a secured in all of the Best of France “machinery, equipment, inventory and accounts” This was said to secure an obligation due to Worthington since 2014. How the 2014 debt relates to the 2012 debt due Worthington is unexplained. But, the trial court notes that husband never made any payments to the two creditors (Worthington and another named Shapiro) and that there was no loan documentation submitted to the court at trial nor were these debts carried by the accountant on the business balance sheet. At the risk of tedium, I note that husband professed that Worthington had a secured interest in the assets as a matter of New York law. One has to ask when and how New York adopted “paperless” secured interests. Moreover, how did the assets of Best of France get into the hands of Crimi, LLC in 2019 without addressing the secured interests said to be outstanding.

The opinion informs us that there was also a parcel of real estate. Husband stopped paying the mortgage and taxes on that property after “separation.” The property was sold by the sheriff and the mortgagee took title. The resourceful Chance Worthington popped up and made a deal to buy the property from the bank for $700,000. Chance was fortunate to find a party to lease his newly acquired property. Husband agreed to pay Worthington $6,000 a month as rent. That’s almost twice what it would have cost husband to borrow $700,000 when the foreclosure/rental deal was made. The trial court found that husband paid the rent promptly and that at the time the foreclosure took place, his bank statement demonstrated the ability to pay Wells Fargo its monthly mortgage. This foreclosure and lease was expressly found to be a dissipation intended deliberately to deprive wife of an equitable distribution.

The appellate opinion ends blandly. The trial court made credibility determinations and those are entitled to the “fullest consideration.” The appellate court find that it saw no records dispositively showing that the debts to either Worthington or Shapiro were actually made before separation. It also enforces an agreement wife alleged that she made with husband as a condition of their reconciliation. “We agreed that he would not do anything with the business without my knowledge and primarily had to do with taking out loans, whether they were business or personal private loans or business loans. No loans period without a discussion and he agreed to that.”

The case also presents a curious analysis on the valuation of “inventory.” While there were two court orders in 2017 related to creating an inventory of assets, neither party produced an expert opinion related to the value of that property. In fact, husband did not produce an inventory at all but professed that he relied upon his records of his acquisition costs. Meanwhile he also told the court that there was “no way” to track what was in the business inventory at the date of separation. Wife offered the court photos of the property she professed to be inventory and provided 2014 values for each object based upon her “professional opinion.” Her opinion was that the inventory had a wholesale value of $1,595,753. The trial court adopted those values and discarded husband’s argument that his reported acquisition costs should have been employed instead noting that he didn’t provide that information. The Court does reference the Forms 1125-A filed with the business returns and concludes that they reconcile with Wife’s valuation. (Opinion p. 20). The problem this writer sees with that reconciliation is that the year end inventories for tax years 2013 and 2014 never exceeded $457,000.

In the end, the case is remanded and for that the trial court must be granted sympathy. It seems the equitable reimbursement alimony included what amounted to arrears from a spousal support/apl action. The Superior Court properly notes that support/apl arrearages are one kind of award. Equitable reimbursement alimony is confined to settings where distribution of the “existing marital assets…would be insufficient to compensate the payee spouse for his or her contributions to the marriage.” Johnson v. Johnson, 864 A.2d 1224, 1230 (Pa.Super, 2004). The appellate panel notes that the court identified and valued marital assets based on wife’s inventory. Husband argued that these assets were subject to a security interest but he provided no documentation to show the loans or the perfection of the secured interest. Meanwhile the court offers that if wife should co-habit, the alimony might be lost. (Opinion p. 32) But, isn’t the entire point of this “reimbursement alimony” to eliminate that risk? Section 3701 of the Divorce Code indicates that alimony is needs based and the need is deemed forfeited by cohabitation. 23 Pa.C.S. 3706. Equitable reimbursement really isn’t alimony because it is equity based and not needs based. This is a topic where there needs to be judicial clarity. Suppose a New York court finds that the inventory is physically located in that state’s jurisdiction and that there is somehow a valid lien due to Worthington or Shapiro? Isn’t wife still entitled to her share of what the Pennsylvania court found to be unencumbered marital assets? Equitable reimbursement may be her only remedy and cohabitation should not allow those rights to be lost. The Superior Court was correct to sever the support arrears from equitable reimbursement. But the court could and should have simply clarified through a modified order that $836,394 was indefeasible equitable reimbursement and that the balance of alimony pendente lite due under the December 2019 order ($21,780 per page 3 of the opinion) was not modified by the final divorce decree and order.

This is a troubling case. It is chock-filled with important legal issues, none of which was really decided. Like the recent Snyder case, it is also a case where one party effectively led the court and a spouse on a wild goose chase to find the assets. At 1,600 words, the reader has endured enough of this post. But, the takeaway is that courts need to get a leash on cases such as this one. In a future blog, we’ll explore remedies to accomplish that.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told participants at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""made a big strategic mistake"" by ordering his military to invade Ukraine. Tuesday marked three months of fighting, with no immediate hope for peace. Russia has suffered huge losses and abandoned an attempt to seize the capital, Kyiv. It is now focusing on expanding areas in eastern Ukraine that pro-Russian separatists controlled before the war. Russia intensified its offensive in the Donbas region, and tried to surround Ukrainian fighters in Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and Rubizhne. Russian forces are bombarding Severodonetsk mercilessly, local commanders report. If Russia captures the city, it will control the Luhansk region, Britain's Foreign Ministry said.

The agreement covers 312 former patients who say the doctor, James Heaps, abused them during what were supposed to be medical examinations between 1983 and 2018. The latest settlement brings the total payouts in cases involving Heaps to nearly $700 million, the most ever paid by a public university to settle sexual abuse allegations. Heaps specialized in cancer treatment. Some of the plaintiffs were cancer patients. A few had late-stage, terminal cancers. One died before a Los Angeles Superior Court judge approved the settlement.

President Biden on Wednesday is expected to sign an executive order to reform federal policing, two years after the death of George Floyd. Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who pinned him to the ground for nine minutes, restricting his breathing. Biden will direct federal agencies to revise their use-of-force policies and create a database of officers fired for misconduct. He will also restrict the transfer of most military equipment to police agencies, The New York Times reported. The White House started working on the order last year when police reform failed in the Senate. A leaked draft reportedly drew an angry reaction from policing groups, but the White House made the final version more centrist.

8. U.S. births edge higher after pandemic plummet

U.S. births increased by 1 percent last year compared with 2020, although there were still fewer births than in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to a government report released Tuesday. There were nearly 3.7 million births reported in the U.S. last year, up from 3.6 million the year before but 86,000 fewer than in 2019. U.S. births were falling for more than a decade before the coronavirus crisis started. Officials speculated that last year's rise was partly due to couples who had delayed trying to get pregnant early in the pandemic. Deliveries were extremely low in January but picked up later in the year, said Brady Hamilton of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

To many of them, the sky is falling. Joy Reid of MSNBC asserts that Musk wants to bring back South African Apartheid that he “enjoyed” in the 1980s. Never mind that Musk was born in 1971 and was still a child in the 1980s. But the Left never lets pesky facts get in the way of the hyperbolic speech and attempts to manipulate the emotions of unsuspecting Americans. MSNBC host Ari Melber says that Musk could hack the political debate with his newfound power and “secretly ban one’s candidate” or “turn down the reach of their stuff, and turn up the reach of something else . . . .” Yes. They certainly know about these tactics, as we watched Silicon Valley elites and the media do exactly this the last time we had an election and President Trump was in fact banned on Twitter. And despite the fact that in buying Twitter, Musk said he wants Twitter’s algorithm to be open source, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey tweeted that Congress “must pass laws to protect privacy and promote algorithmic justice.”

Axios claims Musk “is increasingly behaving like a movie supervillain.” Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post printed an op-ed by a former CEO of Reddit calling for government regulations “to prevent rich people from controlling our channels of communication.” The irony of this article appearing in a paper owned by one of the richest men in America where political bias is on full display every day is lost on these people. It makes most of us shake our head and sometimes laugh—or cringe. Where were these defenders of internet fairness two years ago?

But here are some facts: Elon Musk states he wants to make the internet fair. Musk claims to be an “absolutist” when it comes to free speech. He hopes that even those who dislike him will stay on Twitter—and even said so. He tweeted recently that if 10% of the people on the extreme Left and 10% of people on the extreme right are unhappy at any given time about Twitter—that is a good thing. This is a classic example of free speech. We may be very angry about what someone says or writes. The genius of America is we have a right to be angry and they have a right to say or write it. Welcome to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and freedom of speech.

Like the ubiquitous late-night television commercials: But wait! There is more. The Biden Administration just established, under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Disinformation Governance Board. Yes, the United States now has a ministry of truth. In autocracies and dictatorships, it is common practice to do what this Administration is doing. When a tyrant and his ruling elites cannot win over the populace in an open debate, they usually resort to limiting the information the people have in order to make the debate one-sided—or for there to be no debate! When political operatives in banana republics—or Communist China—cannot convince the public of the value of their leaders’ ideas or policies—they simply suppress contrary views so that their views are the only options out there. Who would have thought that any political party—or any U.S. President—would resort to this tactic? It is literally unthinkable. And it is here.

Nina Jankowicz is the head of the Disinformation Governance Board. A political operative who used social media to deny the now verified Hunter Biden computer scandal and deem it as Russian propaganda, she has been in the job two months as the propaganda minister of the Biden Administration. The creation of this board, and her appointment as leader, was confirmed in recent congressional testimony by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

Mayorkas stated that the reason such a board is necessary is tied to national security. Disinformation, he said, “creates a landscape of vulnerability for state actors to use to the detriment of the United States.” This board would focus on the spread of disinformation especially in minority communities ahead of the 2022 elections, according to the DHS Secretary. In other words, the Biden Administration is violating the 245-year-old American value of free speech and ignoring the 231-year history of the First Amendment—but they are doing it because they care about America. They are doing it for you.

It brings to mind men like Joseph Goebbels. He was a Nazi leader under Adolf Hitler. Appointed to lead the Ministry of Propaganda and Public Enlightenment, Goebbels envisioned an empire that would control educational institutions, film, radio, and newspapers. (The only reason Goebbels did not monitor social media was because it had not been invented yet.) Goebbels, too, justified this as being necessary for Germany’s national security. He used the Editors Law of 1933, Clause 14, which ordered editors to omit “anything calculated to weaken the strength of the Reich abroad or at home.” His board issued detailed guidelines as to what stories should not be reported and how to report events and issues. Sound familiar?

News flash to Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden: “Misinformation” speech is protected speech—just like hate speech is protected speech. It is embedded in our Constitution. Freedom of speech is one of the cornerstones of American freedoms. Frequently people say things that are hateful, disrespectful, or downright crazy – even factually incorrect. I hate it. So do you. But they have every right—especially a constitutional right—to say these things. The answer to disinformation is not Nina Jankowicz or the Disinformation Governance Board. The answer is more information. The answer to speech deemed wrong or hateful is more speech. The debate of ideas is central to freedom and democracy. The marketplace of ideas will test the merits of anyone’s claims or opinions.

The Disinformation Governance Board, the woke emphasis on controlling what people say, think, or read, and the reactions to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter are direct attacks on the First Amendment. They are assaults on freedom of speech—not unlike what happens in Putin’s Russia today or in the Chinese Communist Party. We must speak out. Individual rights in the United States have been under attack and, to a certain extent, have been eroding for years. It is time to draw a line. Enough is enough. This stops here; it stops now.

To be clear, and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed this, Bident’s Disinformation Governance Board will use the power of a law enforcement agency (DHS) to “prevent” whatever the Biden Administration deems “disinformation and misinformation.” At a minimum this will have an unconstitutional chilling effect on free speech if not worse. How far will they go? We’ve just submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to DHS as a first step toward getting to the bottom of this and fighting back.",Q2

Antifa in Portland has continued their violence in May, attacking a GOP gubernatorial campaign rally and injuring two people.

So of course, you could count on the rioters that we’ve seen come out over the past few years going into full destruction mode over the SCOTUS decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

A group of about 100, all clad in black bloc, gathered in Grant Park on Saturday night. A flyer announcing the event declared: “If Abortions Aren’t Safe Then You aren’t Either,” the saying of the violent group Jane’s Revenge. The group then went on a rampage for “abortion rights,” smashing and vandalizing throughout the city.

“Death to SCOTUS” at least one graffiti message proclaimed, while another said, “Abort the Court.” Other fun messages included “Abolish schools” (because, after all, who needs education?) and their traditional favorite, “ACAB” (All Cops Are Bastards).

In addition to smashing the windows of businesses, they attacked a school van, breaking out its windows and spraying graffiti on it. The group also were seen destroying a Tesla.

When a resident dared to question what they were doing, he was threatened by the group.

While the Portland Police were present they said that they didn’t have the resources to deal with the group. Nice. So Portland has so denuded their city of the ability to respond, that businesses might as well just pack up and leave.

Portland mayoral aide Sam Adams decried the destruction, “It’s despicable,” he says, “we need more police.”

Ironically, it’s always the very liberal Starbucks that gets it in the teeth in these riots.

They had also been violent the day before with little reaction by the police, including setting a fire in front of the Portland federal courthouse that Antifa attacked for more than 100 days in a row in the summer of 2020.

So even two years after the massive mess that was the riots there in 2020, Portland is still out of control. They still haven’t stopped the radicals, basically because they have no real interest in doing so. If they did, they’d stop them. They just throw up their hands and despair.

Unidentified terrorists have killed two Catholic priests in the Nigerian states of Kaduna and Edo, according to statements by their respective archdioceses which come a month after two other priests were slain in two other districts in the West African country.

The victims have been identified as Fr. Vitus Borogo, a priest serving in the Archdiocese of Kaduna, and Fr. Christopher Odia from the Diocese of Auchi.

Borogo was killed in a raid on a farm along Kaduna-Kachia Road Saturday, and Odia was kidnapped from his rectory at St. Michael Catholic Church in Edo State’s Ikabigbo area and then killed by his captors Sunday evening, Catholic News Agency reported, citing a statement by the chancellor of the Kaduna archdiocese.

Borogo, 50, was a chaplain at Kaduna State Polytechnic, and 42-year-old Odia was the administrator of St. Michael’s and principal of St. Philip Catholic Secondary School in Jattu area.

Catholic News Agency also noted that more Christians are killed for their faith in Nigeria than in any other country worldwide — at least 4,650 in 2021, and nearly 900 in the first three months of 2022 alone.

In May, unidentified gunmen stormed a Catholic parish in northern Nigeria and abducted two priests, identified as Fr. Stephen Ojapa and Fr. Oliver Okpara from the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, and two unidentified boys from St. Patrick Catholic Church in Gidan Maikambo area of Katsina state’s Kafur Local Government Area, Vatican News reported at the time.

In a separate incident the same month, radical Islamic militants affiliated with either the Islamic Fulani herdsmen or the Islamic State West Africa Province killed at least eight Christians, including children younger than 5, and wounded several others in an attack in Borno state.

Also last month, the Islamic State terror group released a video showing the execution of about 20 Christian civilians in Borno State in revenge for the killing of their leader in Syria by the United States special forces in February.

The video, released by an IS-linked news outlet, showed a masked militant executing a Christian civilian while saying it was revenge for the killing of their leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, an Iraqi Islamic terrorist and the second “caliph” of the Islamic State.

Open Doors USA, which monitors persecution in over 60 countries, earlier reported that at least 4,650 Christians were killed between Oct. 1, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2021. That is an increase from 3,530 the previous year. Additionally, more than 2,500 Christians were kidnapped, up from 990 a year earlier.",Q2

That included two times each in Duluth, Moose Lake, and Hibbing and one time each in Aurora, Cloquet, Grand Rapids, and International Falls.

Of course, that’s also 86 times too often, even if numbers of incidents are trending downward. The more than 5,800 carriers bitten nationally in 2020 dropped to more than 5,400 in 2021 and to more than 5,300 last year.

To emphasize the seriousness of these attacks and the need for dog owners to do more to ensure their animals are secured while carriers are making their rounds, the U.S. Postal Service sponsored Dog Bite Awareness Week last week. The theme was, “Even good dogs have bad days.” For all the Postal Service's ongoing challenges in recent years with slow mail, budget shortfalls, and more, dogs attacking carriers remains a persistent one not to be overlooked.

“When letter carriers deliver mail in our communities, dogs that are not secured or leashed can become a nemesis and unpredictable,” Leeann Theriault, USPS employee safety and health awareness manager, said in a June 1 statement to news outlets, including to the Duluth News Tribune Opinion page. “Help us deliver your mail safely by keeping your dog secure and out of the way before your carrier arrives.”

There’s no reason for postal employees to be suffering dog bites once every 15 seconds, each attack leaving “trauma and scarring (and) a lasting impact on our carriers,” as the USPS said in a statement during awareness week last year. Making that worse is the reality that “dog attacks and bites are 100 percent preventable when dog owners remain vigilant and properly restrain” their animals.""

The preventable incidents happen despite carriers knowing that any dog can bite, even those that don’t seem aggressive, and despite carriers being trained to respect a dog’s territory, to not startle a dog, to keep their eyes on any dog they see, to make noise or rattle a fence to alert a dog when entering a yard, to never attempt to pet or feed a dog, and to place their foot against an outward swinging door to prevent a dog from escaping.

“Dogs are generally protective of their turf, and dog owners have an important responsibility to control them to ensure safe mail delivery,” the USPS said in the statement. “Most people know the approximate time their letter carrier arrives every day. Securing your dog before the carrier approaches your property will minimize any potentially dangerous interactions.”

More specifically, the USPS urges dog owners to keep their pets inside or behind a fence, away from the door or in another room, or on a leash when the mail carrier is expected. In addition, pet owners should remind children not to take mail directly from a letter carrier as the dog may view the carrier as a threat to the child.

“When our mail carriers are bitten, it is usually a ‘good dog’ that had not previously behaved in a menacing way,” USPS Occupational Safety and Health Senior Director Linda DeCarlo said. “In 2022, too many aggressive dogs impacted the lives of our employees while delivering the mail. Please help us reduce that number by being a responsible pet owner who secures their dog as we deliver the mail.”

Finally, the USPS offered this warning, not only to dog owners: ""When a carrier feels unsafe, mail service could be halted — not only for the dog owner, but for the entire neighborhood. When mail service is stopped, mail must be picked up at the Post Office. Service will not be restored until the aggressive dog is properly restrained.""

Put simply, one bite is too many. More than 5,300 across the U.S. and 86 in Minnesota — in 2022 alone — is a warning siren that demands to be answered and taken seriously by pet owners acting responsibly.",Q2

Wade decision that guaranteed women the right to terminate their pregnancies for the past 50 years.

Louisiana's ""trigger law"" that was updated and signed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards on June 21 ""shall become effective immediately upon ... any decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which overrules, in whole or in part, Roe v. Wade.""

All three of Louisiana's abortion clinics — Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Women's Health Care Center in New Orleans and Hope Medical Group in Shreveport — immediately stopped performing abortions Friday when the decision was announced.

Drug-induced abortions, which now account for about half of all abortions, are also illegal.

There are no legal exceptions for rape or incest, although there is an exception to save the life of the pregnant mother.

Louisiana law specifically exempts pregnant women from prosecution but provides maximum criminal penalties for doctors or others who terminate pregnancies of $200,000 fines and 15 years in jail for late-term abortions.

“I am and have always been unabashedly pro-life and opposed to abortion,"" Edwards said in a statement. ""However, I understand that people on both sides of this complex issue hold deeply personal beliefs, and I respect that not everyone, including many in my own party, agrees with my position.

""While we are still reviewing the decision issued by the court, Louisiana has had a trigger law in place since 2006 that would outlaw abortion, without exception for rape and incest, should the United States Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.""

More:Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signs abortion ban with no exceptions for rape, incest

Emergency contraception drugs like what are known as ""morning after pills"" remain legal.

""Louisiana is committed to protecting life and supporting moms,"" said Democratic Monroe Sen. Katrina Jackson, whose bill updated the state's 2006 abortion trigger law.

Jackson also previously authored the amendment declaring there is no right to and no funding of abortion in the Louisiana Constitution that 62% of voters approved in 2020.

But others, like Louisiana's only Democratic Congressman Troy Carter of New Orleans, considers the Supreme Court reversal a setback for women's healthcare and individual rights.

“Today the Supreme Court acted not to expand, but to take away the rights and freedoms of the American people for the first time in our nation’s history,"" Carter said. ""Today, six members of the Supreme Court have inserted themselves between patients and doctors. They have interrupted these private conversations with far-right legal principles that limit personal healthcare decisions like when to start a family.""

Louisiana's strict abortion trigger law update was attacked by the White House after it was passed by the Legislature.

Read this:Biden attacks Louisiana abortion bill with no exceptions for rape, incest as 'radical'

The White House released the following statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre June 6.

""The Louisiana Legislature has taken the latest step in a growing attack against the fundamental freedoms of Americans,"" the statement said. ""Louisiana’s extreme bill will criminalize abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest and punish reproductive healthcare professionals with up to 10 years in prison.""

There are other abortion ban trigger laws in 13 other states, according to the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute, which means Louisiana women would have to travel as far as New Mexico and or Illinois to have an abortion.

Kentucky's and South Dakota's trigger laws also go into effect immediately, while the other 10 states' abortion bans begin after certification by state officials.

Louisiana's law does allow for the termination of ectopic pregnancies, which are where the fetus develops outside the uterus and can't survive, as well for removing a deceased baby from the womb or removing a child that can't live outside the womb.

In vitro fertilization remains legal in the state.

Mike DeWine.

Democrats said the proposal, which is optional for schools, sends the wrong message a week after the massacre of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Republicans say the measure could prevent such shootings. Lawmakers fast-tracked the legislation to counter the impact of a court ruling that said, under current law, armed school workers would need hundreds of hours of training.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine speaks to mourners at a memorial service in the Oregon District held to recognize the victims of an early-morning mass shooting in the popular nightspot on August 04, 2019 in Dayton, Ohio.

The bill will protect children by ensuring instruction is specific to schools and including significant scenario-based training, DeWine said late Wednesday in announcing his support.

The measure is opposed by major law enforcement groups, gun control advocates, and the state's teachers' unions, which asked DeWine to veto the measure. It's supported by a handful of police departments and school districts.

Under the latest version of the bill, school employees who carry guns would need up to 24 hours of initial training, then up to eight hours of requalification training annually.

Mayorkas and the DHS created the Disinformation Governance Board, which was announced April 27 during a budget hearing, to protect national security by disseminating guidance to DHS agencies on combating foreign misinformation and disinformation. Many Republicans have been critical of the board, and some have called for it to be disbanded.

Mayorkas later said the DHS could have done a better job of communicating the purpose of the board, but said GOP criticism was “precisely the opposite” of what it would do. He said the board would not monitor American citizens.



Morrisey

“The Department of Homeland Security is not going to be the truth police,” Mayorkas told a Senate subcommittee May 3. “That is the farthest thing from the truth. We protect the security of the homeland.”

The May 5 letter from the 20 AGs says the board threatens to “enforce silence” when Americans wish to express views disfavored by the Biden administration. It also violates the constitutional freedoms the AGs are responsible for defending.

“Every American knows the U.S. Constitution forbids the government to abridge the freedom of speech,” Morrisey said. “The very existence of the Disinformation Governance Board will inevitably have a chilling effect on free speech.

“All Americans will hesitate before they voice their constitutionally protected opinions, knowing the government’s censors may be listening and watching, so some will decide it is safer to keep their opinions to themselves.”

The AGs also raised their suspicions of the timing of the creation of the board – which was at the same time billionaire Elon Musk announced he is buying Twitter. They say, by the Biden administration’s own admission, it has been “flagging problematic posts” on social media sites and coordinating with the private sector to regulate Americans’ free speech.

The AGs say this action raises questions about the extent of the Biden administration’s practice of coordinating with private sector companies to suppress disfavored speech in America.

The coalition of AGs said the board is already chilling free speech and impeding the political process in West Virginia and every other state.

Senate Democrats are ready to drop some of their most pressing demands to restrict access to guns amid the nationwide onslaught of massacres. But even that may not be enough to reach a deal with Republicans.

“I’m certainly prepared for failure,” Sen. Chris Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat helping lead the talks, told CNN on Thursday. “I’ve been here enough times to know that this is probably the most politically complicated and emotionally fraught piece that Congress deals with.”

Murphy, who is part of a bipartisan group of senators working behind the scenes to respond to deadly gun-related attacks nationwide, acknowledged in an interview that any accord would have to be “incremental” in order to win at least 10 Republican votes to break a filibuster in the 50-50 Senate — even as he expressed optimism that a deal could be reached by next week.

“I’ve also heard Republicans make clear that as long as we’re not talking about doing everything at once, as long as we’re talking about more incremental but significant changes, they’re open,” said Murphy, who has been briefing President Joe Biden on the state of the talks.

Indeed, as House Democrats plan to move forward with a bill to ban so-called assault weapons, Senate Democrats are not even discussing a ban on firearms like AR-15s, the high-powered rifle used in the Texas elementary school massacre and a spate of mass shootings. They are also conceding that a bipartisan proposal to expand background checks on commercial firearm sales will have to be narrowed, even as the House passed a bill last year to mandate universal background checks on all commercial sales and private transfers as well.

And sources in both parties told CNN that a push to raise the age to 21 for purchasing semi-automatic rifles has yet to gain much traction in Senate talks, as Republican opposition to the idea begins to mount and Democrats are uncertain whether it can win the necessary 60 votes to break a filibuster.

“That’s hard to see,” one GOP source said of raising the age to 21 for purchasing the weapons, even as federal law prohibits 18- to 20-year-olds from purchasing handguns.

“Not gonna happen,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a chief GOP negotiator, tweeted about imposing new restrictions on guns, though his office declined to specify what he meant.

Asked last week about raising the age to 21 for buying the powerful guns, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis — a Republican involved in the bipartisan talks — was skeptical.

“When I think of that, I think do we take a look at the age you can enlist in the military?” Tillis asked. “So there are a lot of complexities to that question.”

Indeed, even after the Democratic concessions on gun control, senators say, the prospects that bipartisan talks could collapse in the coming days are very real.

“There’s still significant work to do and hurdles to overcome,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who is heavily involved in the bipartisan talks.

Murphy and Blumenthal have been here before — ever since the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in their home state of Connecticut. And even soon after the murders of 20 young children and six adults there, Democrats fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance a bill by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to mandate background checks on firearm sales at gun shows and over the internet.

Numerous legislative efforts in the wake of many subsequent mass shootings have also floundered, including an effort by Murphy to revive the Manchin-Toomey bill last year by simply closing the so-called gun show loophole and leaving out background checks on internet sales altogether. But despite Murphy’s talks with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on the matter last year, the renewed push to narrow the Manchin-Toomey bill never coalesced into a deal.

“It’s too broad,” Graham told CNN when asked if he could get behind the Manchin-Toomey plan in the aftermath of last week’s Uvalde, Texas, massacre.

Yet even so, senators are reengaging in talks in a way different from other mass shootings given the scale of the Uvalde massacre, with the murders of 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School — at the hands of an 18-year-old with an AR-15-style weapon. Senators say a deal must be reached by sometime next week or nothing will get done — again.

“I think next week is critical,” Murphy said, given that senators have been at home during this week’s recess and return to Washington next week. “My hope is that we’ll have a product for both Republicans and Democrats to look at when we return. And that will give us a sense as to whether we can get this passed. Every day that goes by I’m more optimistic. But I don’t think we’ll really know until everybody gets back in town.”

How the Senate talks are shaping up

The talks are centering on a narrower version of the Manchin-Toomey proposal — along with several other ideas. Blumenthal and Graham are engaged in renewed talks over incentives to bolster state laws empowering authorities to restrict gun access to individuals deemed a threat — referred to as red flag laws. There are ongoing talks, including between Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, to impose new rules on trafficking of guns between states.

Republicans, including Cornyn and Tillis, are in talks over school safety provisions as well as ways to bolster the US mental health system. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, is involved in those talks as well.

Yet it’s far from clear how much money senators will propose to bolster mental health programs. And it’s also uncertain whether Republicans will demand that the costs of the programs be fully paid for by spending cuts or unused Covid-19 relief money — something that could cause Democrats to revolt.

Murphy said he didn’t yet know how the group would structure mental health provisions and how much it would cost.

“It’s all about what can get 60-plus votes in the Senate, and we’re working on that and that will have to do with the spending as well as the provisions,” Murphy said.

Mitch McConnell, the Senate GOP leader, said in his home state of Kentucky on Thursday that he wants a bipartisan deal “to target” the problem, which is “school safety and mental illness” and that it must be “consistent with the Second Amendment” — a different view from that of many Democrats, who see lax gun laws as the main culprit.

But with McConnell’s support critical to determining whether a deal can reach 60 votes in the Senate, Murphy viewed the GOP leader’s comments in a positive light.

“I’ve read carefully everything that Senator McConnell has said in the past 48 hours,” Murphy said. “And so far, I don’t read anything he said to foreclose the deal that is very focused on keeping weapons out of the hands of potentially dangerous people.”

Yet other issues could be left on the cutting room floor. There are ongoing talks, including between Blumenthal and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, about safely storing firearms at residences. But there’s still a philosophical disagreement on how and whether to mandate certain approaches on storing the weapons, according to several sources.

Despite the skepticism among Republicans, Murphy would not rule out a deal on a ban on 18- to 20-year-olds purchasing semi-automatic rifles like AR-15s, given that has been a recurring characteristic of mass murderers, including in Uvalde.

But whether the Senate agrees to new age restrictions is highly uncertain.

“We’re certainly having a conversation about the fact that mass shooters tend to be of the same profile: young and male in their late teens and early 20s,” Murphy said of the Senate talks. “I don’t know what we’ll end up with, but I think there is an acknowledgment from everybody that a lot of these mass shooters tend to be of the same profile.”

Any deal, Murphy conceded, will be “far from perfect.” But he said that at the moment GOP interest on finding a deal has not waned.

“Too often they’ll be interested in talking for the first couple of days, and then it gets harder for my phone calls to be returned,” Murphy said of Republicans. “That’s not what’s happening this time. This time there is an earnestness of engagement from a cross-section of Republicans that’s mounting by the day.”

He was 74.

His sister, Maryellen Kernaghan, announced the death but did not provide a cause.

As the longtime director of a shoestring organization called the National Labor Committee, Mr. Kernaghan was among the first activists to show that the seemingly magical drop in prices for a wide range of consumer goods in the 1980s and ’90s was a result of American companies’ shift of production to developing countries, where workers often toiled in dangerous conditions for pennies an hour.

He specialized in the high-profile takedown, going after brands like Nike, Disney and Walmart. He targeted Bratz dolls, Eddie Bauer outdoor wear and Microsoft wireless mice. In 2007 he showed that crucifixes sold at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan came from a Chinese sweatshop.

A self-described introvert, Mr. Kernaghan became a different person in front of an audience. He could speak for hours, rattling off stories and data in a way that gave a human face to the free-trade debate.",Q2

Two children were also found alive inside the apartment and may have been left with the bodies for two days, police said.

Dallas police said they got a call around noon on Wednesday that led officers to a second-floor apartment at the Northridge Court Apartments on Ridgecrest Road near Park Lane.

Once inside the apartment, officers discovered the bodies of 24-year-old Jimena Sandoval and 27-year-old David Stewart. Both had been shot.

Two children under 5 years old also found inside the apartment. They were both unharmed.

Police have not released any details about when the shooting occurred but two men who live nearby told FOX 4 they heard gunshots Sunday night, more than two days before police arrived and discovered the bodies.

""It was just a couple of gunshots. I think it was like 11 or something like that,"" said neighbor Matis Tolnay. ""And then i heard maybe like three shots fired. Something like that. And then 15 minutes or so, maybe a couple more.

Tolnay said he’s lived in the complex for about three months. He describes it as relatively quiet and said this is the first time he’s heard gunshots outside.

The property manager said she knew the woman who lived inside the apartment. She describes her as a nice person and a good tenant who kept to herself with a young daughter.

Police have not said what the relationship is between the two victims and the children.

They also haven't released any kind of motive or said whether anything was taken from inside the home.",Q2

Claud Lee ""Tex"" McIver III was convicted in 2018 of felony murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony in the shooting death of his wife, Diane.

The couple was on their way home from a party with a friend in 2016 when McIver shot his wife through the back seat of their SUV. She was rushed to the hospital where she died.

There was never any dispute that McIver shot his wife — the question at trial was whether he meant to. Prosecutors said he was driven to kill her because he coveted his wife’s money. Defense attorneys said that was nonsense, that McIver loved his wife dearly and her death was a terrible accident.

The Supreme Court reversed McIver's convictions because they say the trial court ""erred in denying his request to charge the jury on a lesser involuntary manslaughter offense.""

During his trial, Tex McIver admitted to fatally shooting his wife but said it was an accident. He said that he had fallen asleep and the gun he was holding for protection accidentally went off.

The McIvers were wealthy and well-connected. He was a partner at a prominent labor and employment law firm and served on the state election board. She was president of U.S. Enterprises Inc., the parent company of Corey Airport Services.

Tex McIver

McIver was found guilty of felony murder, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and influencing witnesses in connection with the death of his wife. He was sentenced to life in prison.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/fires-cause-arizona-natives-wind-patterns-flames-continue,Fires cause Arizona natives to watch wind patterns as flames continue,"The northern Arizona city of Flagstaff is synonymous with mountains — lush with ponderosa pines, meadows and hiking trails that are a respite from the desert heat farther south.

Now, parts of them are burning yet again, fanned by winds that pushed one fire through more than 27 square miles (70 square kilometers). Winds moderated Tuesday after a day of red flag conditions, which could help firefighters get a better handle on a blaze that has largely spared homes but made a run into a wilderness area and reached a lava dome volcano.

""They're optimistic to make some headway,"" fire information officer Cathie Pauls said Tuesday.

CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA WILDFIRES FORCE EVACUATIONS AS WILDFIRES BURN

Residents around the city looked toward the mountains as smoke billowed through the air and winds howled early this week, some scared, some nervous — most hoping that moisture in the forecast late this week brings some relief.

""We're most definitely dry,"" said Flagstaff resident Colin Challifour. ""The forests are dry. It's unfortunate. You don't like to see it.""

Authorities downgraded evacuation orders Tuesday but people in about 700 homes still were under orders to stay out of the area, the Coconino County Sheriff's Office said. Another 280 homes have been evacuated because of another wildfire that's burned 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) on the outskirts of Flagstaff in a more remote area.

One home and a secondary structure have been destroyed in the larger fire, the sheriff's office said. Wildfires have also forced evacuations in California and New Mexico.

In northern Arizona, Coconino County declared an emergency because of the wildfire.

Fire incident commander Aaron Graeser said the big Flagstaff-area blaze is one of the top priorities in the country for firefighting resources.

Wildfires broke out early this spring in multiple states in the Western U.S., where climate change and an enduring drought are fanning the frequency and intensity of forest and grassland fires. A springtime fire outside Flagstaff destroyed more than two dozen homes. Most of the residents who evacuated then are out of their homes again because of this latest wildfire.

The number of square miles burned so far this year is more than double the 10-year national average, and states like New Mexico have already set records with devastating blazes that destroyed hundreds of homes while causing environmental damage that is expected to affect water supplies.

Nationally, more than 6,200 wildland firefighters were battling nearly three dozen uncontained fires that had charred over 1,780 square miles (4,611 square kilometers) — much of it in the U.S. Southwest, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

In southwest Alaska, favorable winds shifted the progression of a large fire burning through dry grass and brush in largely treeless tundra away from an Alaska Native village, fire managers said Tuesday.

FIRE IN ALASKA PUSHED TOWARD NATIVE ALLOTMENTS BY WIND

The 202-square-mile (523-square-kilometer) East Fork Fire remained just over 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from St. Mary’s, but there were no evacuation orders in place. No structures have been damaged or lost.

The wind shift along with cooler temperatures allowed firefighters to work the active western edge of the East Fork fire and shore up primary and secondary contain lines protecting St. Mary’s and the nearby villages of Pitkas Point, Mountain Village and Pilot Station.

Favorable weather conditions may last longer than expected, possibly into next week, a statement from Alaska Wildland Fire Information said. The fire was started by lightning May 31.

In California, firefighters reported significant progress against a wildfire near the San Gabriel Mountains community of Wrightwood, but evacuation orders and warnings remained in place. The blaze has scorched about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers) since erupting during the weekend and was 27% contained.

In Northern California's Tehama County, firefighters gained 30% containment of a fire that has destroyed 10 buildings, damaged four others and threatened about 160 structures, fire officials said.

ARIZONA WILDFIRES DOUBLE IN SIZE CAUSING RESIDENTS TO FLEE

In a wildfire-related situation, a 50-mile (80-km) stretch of State Route 70 in Northern California remained closed indefinitely after mud, boulders and dead trees inundated lanes during flash floods along a burn scar.

The causes of the latest California fires were under investigation.

Lightning is suspected in one of the northern Arizona fires, but authorities don't yet know what caused the larger wildfire.

New effort underway to free cargo ship stuck for 3 weeks in the Chesapeake Bay

The Ever Forward container ship is shown in the Chesapeake Bay after running aground near Baltimore on April 5, 2022 in Pasadena, Maryland.

Following two failed attempts, a new effort got underway on Wednesday to dislodge a 130-ton, fully-loaded cargo ship that has been mired in the mud of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland for more than three weeks.

U.S. Coast Guard officials said two large cranes and two barges were being moved to where the Ever Forward container ship ran aground in shallow water and crews are expected to begin off-loading a portion of the 5,000 cargo containers aboard, hoping that will give the vessel the buoyancy required to free it.

""They're still staging the equipment so that they can remove the containers. It's going to take a few days to get that set up,"" Petty Officer Cynthia Oldham, a spokesperson for the Coast Guard, told ABC News on Wednesday afternoon.

She said once the cranes and barges are in place, crews could start removing containers by this weekend or early next week.

""Hopefully, it's going to be wrapped up around April 15, but that, of course, is dependent on a lot of different variables,"" Oldham said.

The 1,095-foot ship belongs to Evergreen Marine Corp., the same company that owns the Ever Given cargo ship that got stuck in Egypt's Suez Canal in March 2021, blocking the world-famous waterway for six days and causing massive delays in global shipping.

The Coast Guard said the Ever Forward is stranded in mud in about 23 feet of water off Downs Park in Pasadena, Maryland, about 20 miles south of Baltimore. The ship is outside of the deep-water shipping channel so it's not blocking boat traffic on the Chesapeake Bay.

""The ship is grounded from bow to stern,"" Oldham said.

Two previous attempts to free the vessel were not successful. Crews tried to move the ship with multiple tugboats, but it wouldn't budge. Crews have also dredged around the hull of the big boat, but that effort was in vain, too.

The latest plan calls for removing some of the containers, which weigh 8,000 pounds each empty, from both the starboard and port side to maintain the stability of the ship, Oldham said.

""A few hundred containers are expected to be removed, not all of them,"" Oldham said.

The refloating situation has gone so bad that the Evergreen Marine has notified anyone with a container on board that they will need to share in the cost of freeing the ship under the law of general average, a principal of maritime law dating back to 1890.

""Evergreen Line urges all cargo interests involved, and joint venture slot users to provide security bonds and necessary documents according to the adjusting rules that govern GA in order to take delivery of cargo after the vessel is freed and arrives at its future ports of discharge,"" the company said in a statement released this week.

John Martino of the Annapolis School of Seamanship told ABC affiliate station WMAR in Baltimore that the new plan to free the ship is fraught with danger.

""They have to be careful the order they take the containers off,"" said Martino, who visited the ship on Tuesday. “So, they have to make sure everything stays balanced as they go along.""

As a precaution, the Coast Guard is only allowing the work to unload the vessel to occur during daylight hours.

The container vessel ran aground March 13 after leaving the Seagirt marine terminal in Baltimore. The Hong Kong-flagged ship was headed to Norfolk, Virginia, when the mishap occurred.

There were no reports of injuries or damage to the ship or its cargo.

Following the incident, Evergreen immediately activated its emergency response plan and appointed a salvor to conduct underwater inspections of the ship and come up with refloating plan.

Evergreen reported that an inspection showed that no fuel or pollution have leaked from the ship into the Chesapeake Bay.",Q2

Footage shared on social media showed a throng of PML-N supporters waving flags, holding banners and placards, and chanting slogans in favour of their party supremo Nawaz Sharif and against Khan.

Police contingents deployed outside Jemima's home were also seen in the footage.

Separately, PTI supporters also took out demonstrations at London's Hyde Park.

Footage shared by the PTI also showed a protest outside Nawaz's Avenfield residence.

PML-N leader Abid Sher Ali had on Thursday first announced that a protest would be held outside Jemima's London home. He had also shared an image bearing her full address and used derogatory language against Khan.

""Protests outside my house, targeting my children, anti-Semitic abuse on social media ... It’s almost like I’m back in 90s Lahore,"" Jemima had said in response to Ali.

Ali had responded to Jemima, holding her former husband responsible for the protest. ""He (Imran) has ordered attacks and protests outside [the] homes of his political opponents. He incites hate, homophobia and terrorism on [a] daily basis,"" he had said.

The PML-N leader had said that the protest would be ""peaceful and non-violent"".

PTI, PML-N supporters face off in London

Supporters of the PML-N and the PTI had faced off outside Nawaz's London residence last Sunday, as one group had celebrated and the other had protested Khan's ouster after a successful no-confidence vote. A heavy police contingent had stood in a chain between the two groups as they had chanted slogans against each other’s leaders.

The morning had started with a few PML-N supporters gathering outside Nawaz’s Avenfield House residence to celebrate. A stone’s throw away in the green expanses of Hyde Park, hundreds of PTI supporters demonstrated against Khan's ouster.

Khan's UK spokesperson Sahibzada Jahangir had in a video message called on the party’s supporters to gather at the park and then march to the US embassy to register their protest against alleged “foreign interference by America in Pakistan”.

A message circulating in PTI WhatsApp groups had said the purpose of the demonstration was to raise their voice against “regime change” and the Supreme Court’s decision; and to demand free and fair elections through electronic voting as well as the right of overseas Pakistanis to vote.

At the PTI protest, both speakers and members of the crowd had condemned the alleged US role in Khan's removal, with many saying they believed the letter and conspiracy the PTI chairman spoke of was a reality. Several of Khan’s supporters were also critical of the military establishment and blamed it for his exit.

Although the plan for the PTI crowd was to march to the US embassy at 2pm, hundreds of people had instead turned towards Park Lane and decided to take their protest to Avenfield House. Police had raced ahead of the PTI demonstrators to create a divide between PML-N workers who were already outside Nawaz’s residence.",Q2

It's one of the top complaints received by the Better Business Bureau.

Millions of Americans have home warranties for peace of mind if an appliance fails. But many say their claims were denied when those warranties were actually needed.

When Rosalie Battle's 16-year-old heat furnace and air conditioning stopped working, she called her home warranty company. She had been paying them $500 a year for protection.

The company sent a repairman to her house. He claimed the issue was a simple fix, but it wasn't.

""He said it was a fuse,"" said Battles. ""But two hours later, it went out.""

She called the company again and they sent a second repairman. He said there was a blown heat exchanger.

Battles was stunned by what her warranty company then told her. They said the $1,000 repair didn't qualify for coverage

She said, ""They are not going to fix it because its a manufacturer's defect. I said, 'What's that got to do with me?'""

Since then, Battle ended up canceling her home warranty. She said it wasn't worth the money for her.

""The warranty's a waste,"" she said. ""They got all these loopholes!""

A home warranty is supposed to help pay for repairs like this. So why are so many people saying their warranty company denied their claim?

Sarah Wetzel with the Better Business Bureau said warranties can be great if they actually cover the costs.

""So consumers do need to take caution if they're saying that everything is covered,"" Wetzel said.

Indeed, the North Dakota officials have agreed that their state becomes the home of Bitzero – a 100% renewable Bitcoin mining company “driven by green power source, disruptive innovation, and technology.”

The news was announced in a joint press release by Bitzero and the office of the North Dakota governor on June 1.

Specifically, the deal was made between the state governor Doug Burgum, Bitzero Strategic Investor Kevin O’Leary, Bitzero CEO Akbar Shamji, and Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation Chairman Mark Fox.

Running green Bitcoin mining operations out of North Dakota

This deal would allow Bitzero to establish its headquarters on the North Dakota soil and make it a hub for all of the company’s North American operations.

The Bitzero CEO explained the company’s plans in more detail, saying that it was planning to build 200 megawatts of data centers in the state over the next two to three years “with a specific purpose of servicing state data requirements.”

An investment of $400 million to $500 million will fund the data centers, while the company is also involved in a joint graphene battery technology project that will also be brought to North Dakota in a $200 million to $500 million investment over the next two to three years. As for the HQ itself, it will employ 15 to 20 people, according to Shamji.

Additionally, the North Dakota governor expressed his assurance that:

“Bitzero’s decision to locate its North American headquarters in North Dakota is yet another example of how our state is emerging as the location of choice for clean energy data centers supported by reliable, affordable electricity produced with environmental stewardship. This growing industry will continue to diversify our economy and elevate North Dakota’s status as the place to do business for tech entrepreneurs and innovators.”

On top of this, Bitzero plans to partner with MHA Nation for the organization’s greenhouse project, in addition to being involved in multiple discussions for other projects, which they expect to realize in the next several months, the press release said.

The announcement about the usage of green energy in Bitcoin mining in North Dakota comes at a time when the New York State Senate has just approved a measure to ban Bitcoin mining for a minimum of two years due to worries about its impact on the environment.",Q2

Pettus Bridge in Selma to honor civil rights protestors beaten there during 1965's Bloody Sunday.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Malika Sanders-Fortier, D-Selma, would also create a fund called the Tuskegee Airmen Freedom Fund. Money from the fund would go toward monuments memorializing all aspects of Alabama history, including women's suffrage, the civil rights movement and the state's Indigenous peoples.

""When we truly love each other, when we love all people, we can't leave anybody out,"" Sanders-Fortier said during a debate over the bill. ""We can't leave anybody out.""

The bill goes to the House, where it would need to win committee approval and a floor vote in the next three days to get to Gov. Kay Ivey's desk.

A conversation with Rev. Jesse Jackson:Reflecting on decades of civil rights activism

‘Time to march’:Hundreds gather in Selma to commemorate 57th anniversary of Bloody Sunday

The bill would change the name of the Edmund Pettus Bridge to the Edmund Pettus-Foot Soldiers Bridge. The lettering marking the Edmund Pettus Bridge would not change; the bill says the foot soldiers portion of the name should be marked with separate signage that would include a silhouette of the protestors.

A separate provision would direct a portion of money currently going to maintain a Confederate Memorial Park in Chilton County to fund the Tuskegee Airmen Freedom Fund.

Sanders-Fortier's bill passed 23 to 3 but faced opposition from Sen. Gerald Allen, R-Tuscaloosa, who sponsored the 2017 Memorial Preservation Act. That law makes it legally impossible to rename or alter monuments, schools and streets that are at least 40 years old. Governments that do so must pay a $25,000 fine to the state.

Allen attempted to amend the bill to strike the renaming of the Pettus Bridge and the funding of the Tuskegee Airmen Fund.

""We feel like we've got a very solid program in place to monitor and protect history, regardless of what it is,"" he said. ""All history.""

Sanders-Fortier said her bill would not change the name of the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

""Those letters would not be touched at all,"" Sanders-Fortier said. ""Not a single letter would be touched. It would stay in its historic context.""

Allen's motion was defeated. But after the bill passed, the senator blocked transmission of Sanders-Fortier's bill to the House, a requirement for Senate bills passed on or after the 27th day of the session. Later, Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, was able to get unanimous consent to send the bill to the House.

Edmund Pettus was a Confederate general and later a U.S. senator who benefited from Jim Crow segregation. Pettus ran in only one fair election, a state Senate race in 1872 that he lost to Jeremiah Haralson, a former enslaved man from Selma who later served a term in Congress.

The lost congressman:What happened to Jeremiah Haralson?

The bridge was built in 1940. It became infamous when a posse of law enforcement officers attacked civil rights protestors at the foot of the bridge on March 7, 1965. The victims included civil rights activist John Lewis, later a U.S. congressman, and Amelia Boynton, a long-time voting rights activist in Selma who was beaten unconscious. The event led to the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, a catalyst for the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

From 2020:Rename Edmund Pettus Bridge for John Lewis? Some civil rights veterans say no

After Lewis' death in 2020, there were proposals to rename the bridge for him. But such proposals have met a mixed reception in Selma. Some of those attacked on Bloody Sunday feel their bloodshed changed the meaning of the bridge. Others feel that naming the bridge for Lewis, a native of Troy who later lived in Atlanta, would slight local activists like Boynton, who worked for decades on civil rights issues in Selma.

LAS CRUCES, N.M., May 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In four weeks of continuous live-fire exercises, an industry team led by Raytheon Intelligence & Space, a Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) business, and Kord, a wholly owned subsidiary of KBR, defeated multiple 60mm mortar rounds with a 50kW-class high energy laser integrated on a Stryker combat vehicle.

The directed energy weapon system — part of the U.S. Army's Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense, or DE M-SHORAD — acquired, tracked, targeted and defeated multiple mortars and successfully accomplished multiple tests simulating real-world scenarios.

Continuing to put the DE M-SHORAD system to the test, the recent operational assessment at White Sands Missile Range also included defeating several small, medium and large drones.

""Soldiers in the field face increasingly complex threats, and our combat-proven sensors, software, and lasers are ready to give them a new level of protection,"" said Annabel Flores, president of Electronic Warfare Systems for Raytheon Intelligence & Space. ""The Army gave us our toughest challenge yet — countering rockets, artillery and mortars — and we took an essential step on the path to providing the maneuverable, short range air defense Soldiers need.""

The DE M-SHORAD effort is aimed at protecting soldiers against various aerial threats, including unmanned aircraft systems, rotary-wing aircraft, rockets, artillery and mortars. Kord serves as the primary integrator of the system on the Stryker combat vehicle, while Raytheon Intelligence & Space provides the 50kW-class high energy laser weapon module, a specialized radar acquisition system, a beam control system and targeting sensor.

""This team once again showed that the HEL system is fully-integrated and ready to provide protection against complex threats,"" said Byron Bright, President of KBR Government Solutions. ""With an effectively infinite magazine and near-zero cost per shot, HEL is now the proven answer to asymmetric threats like drones and mortars.""

The joint industry team, which includes Rocky Research for power and thermal management, General Dynamics Land Systems for the Stryker platform, and Applied Technology Associates for additional sensors, is preparing to deliver four DE M-SHORAD units to Army Brigade Combat Teams in 2022.

RI&S' high energy laser weapon systems, built in McKinney, Texas, works on land, in the air and at sea, providing 360-degree coverage that can protect bases, airports, stadiums and other high-value military or civilian assets. Open architecture, scalable power, and ruggedized design adapts to the demands of the mission. HEL weapons can be used as standalone systems or rapidly installed on a variety of platforms. Major suppliers for the system are based in Huntsville, Alabama; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Portland, Oregon; East Granby, Connecticut; and Los Angeles, California.

https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2022/06/24/prosecutors-conduct-during-trial-could-lead-to-dismissal-of-child-molestation-case/,Prosecutor’s Conduct During Trial Could Lead To Dismissal Of Child Molestation Case,"A decision is expected soon on whether a former U.S. Army sergeant will stand trial once again on 50 counts of child molestation or if the charges will be forever dismissed due to what a legal ethics expert identified as several ethical violations by the prosecutor who worked the first trial.

Justin Alexander Copeland was serving 34 years in prison with no early release until the Arizona Court of Appeals recently overturned his 50 convictions for allegedly engaging in multiple acts of non-intercourse sexual contact with his stepdaughter in 2016 and 2017.

The official reason noted by the appellate court for ordering the retrial is that Judge Laura Cardinal of the Cochise County Superior Court improperly allowed jurors to be exposed to hearsay testimony which should not have been admitted. However, the three-judge panel also took the opportunity to mention concerns raised with the prosecutor’s conduct before and during Copeland’s 2019 trial.

Those concerns were left for Cardinal to address if the State elected to retry Copeland, which Cochise County Attorney Brian McIntyre has chosen to do.

As a result, McIntyre has until Monday to respond to a highly critical review by Karen Adams, one of Arizona’s top legal ethics attorneys, who did not hold back in her opinion about the unethical conduct of Sara Ransom who was the prosecutor on Copeland’s case.

“In this case, Ransom presented Redacted Clips to the jury that misrepresented the evidence, made statements to the court that were material and knowingly false, misled the jury by leading them to believe certain facts that were untrue, and knowingly mischaracterized facts,” Adams noted in her expert opinion declaration.

The opinion of Adams, who specializes in legal ethics, professional responsibility, and state bar discipline, is included in a 30-page Motion to Dismiss filed on Copeland’s behalf by Cochise County Legal Advocate Xochitl “Sochi” Orozco. The motion argues for Cardinal to dismiss the charges against Copeland “with prejudice” meaning they cannot be refiled.

“The State’s actions in this matter have vitiated Mr. Copeland’s fundamental rights to a fair trial and due process” as guaranteed by the Arizona and U.S. Constitutions, Orozco wrote to Cardinal. “The deliberate, pervasive prosecutorial misconduct dictates that jeopardy attach to Mr. Copeland’s case and the charges be dismissed with prejudice as the conduct violated Mr. Copeland’s rights to due process.”

A key finding in Adams’ report involves bodycam footage of an interview Sierra Vista police had with Copeland. Ransom edited the lengthy video into short “clips” which were played at trial for the jury.

But according to Adams and Orozco, Ransom produced clips which omitted Copeland’s repeated denials and then repeatedly insisted in front of the jurors that Copeland never denied engaging in sexual misconduct culpability during the interview – when in fact he had at least three times.

Those video clips were introduced at trial, Adams noted, only after Ransom argued to the judge that Copeland had been confronted about the sexual abuse allegation but “did not say, oh, wow, no I absolutely did not do this.”

Adams contends another ethics violation occurred when Ransom asked now former Sierra Vista Officer Jock Russell whether Copeland made any admissions during the interview about the molestation allegations “outside of” the redacted video clips.

Russell testified that Copeland “did not deny it,” referring to the sexual misconduct. “Ransom allowed this material false testimony by her testifying officer to stand, and did not correct it,” Adams noted in her report.

Orozco’s motion for dismissal of the charges argues that the prosecutor’s mischaracterization to the Court and the jurors of what Copeland said to police “cannot be deemed to be accidental or a misunderstanding” because it was Ransom, on behalf of the Cochise County Attorney’s Office and the State of Arizona who prepared the clips.

“There can be no other interpretation of the evidence other than the state deliberately misled this Court to convict Mr. Copeland, in clear denial of his right to due process,” Orozco added

Another alleged ethics violation involved several questions the prosecutor asked the girl’s mother on the stand about a court filing the mother made. That filing was a protective order keeping Copeland away from the girl.

Cardinal ruled prior to trial that there was to be no testimony “pertaining to or alluding in any manner to the existence of an application for a protective order…as well as the protective order based on the application.” But the judge had to call a sidebar at which she chided Ransom for “opening a bad door” with the questions.

Even the Arizona Court of Appeals weighed in on the questions Ransom asked the mother, noting the judges did not condone the prosecutor’s “apparent violations of the court’s order” but were not addressing it in the opinion as it “is unlikely to recur at any retrial.”

Cardinal has ordered the parties back to court June 29. Copeland was slated to stand trial again July 19 but a motion to delay the trial is awaiting Cardinal’s ruling.

Copeland’s argument for dismissal is based in part on a 1984 Arizona Supreme Court decision known as Pool v. Superior Court. In that case, the justices dismissed charges against a defendant after the local prosecutor attempted three times to make Steven Pool stand trial in connection with a theft case.

On the third attempt at prosecution, Pool filed a petition for special action to the Arizona Supreme Court, arguing the charges should be dismissed due to double jeopardy and “prosecutorial vindictiveness.” The justices agreed, noting that the question of whether a particular action by the prosecutor is misconduct depends to some extent on the circumstances of the particular case.

“Our system represents a rule of law based upon the principle that officers of the law are bound by and must act within the law, even though the necessity of so doing may put them at a disadvantage in dealing with criminals or those accused of crime,” Justice Stanley Feldman wrote in the Pool opinion.

Feldman went on to cite a 1935 opinion written by U.S. Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland which noted a prosecutor’s interest in a criminal prosecution “is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1683592/verdict-in-2014-karachi-student-murder-case-on-19th,Verdict in 2014 Karachi student murder case on 19th,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court reserved on Tuesday its verdict till April 19 in a case pertaining to the murder of teenage student allegedly by the son of a senior police officer in Defence Housing Authority in 2014.

Salman Abro, the prime accused along with police guards of his father, SSP Ghulam Sarwar Abro, has been charged with shooting to death his classmate Suleman Lashari and wounding his private guard after breaking into the victim’s house on the night of May 8, 2014.

His father’s four police guards — Yasin Jamali, Imran Ali, Maqbool Brohi and Mohammad Rashid — have also been charged with the murder.

The incident had triggered a debate on the social media about the highhandedness of the children of the elite families demonstrating powers in a brutal manner.

On Tuesday, the ATC-VII judge, who is conducting the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, reserved his verdict after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.

The judge will pronounce the verdict on April 19.

In February 2015, the court had formally indicted the main accused and others in the present case. Thus, the trial took around eight years to conclude.

During the trial, the prosecution examined some 18 witnesses, including the victim’s mother, his elder brother and brother-in-law, against the accused persons.

On the other hand, the defence examined four witness, all police officials, who are also facing trial in the same case, to depose in favour of prime accused Abro.

According to the prosecution, Lashari was studying in his balcony around midnight when Abro and his police guards came to settle a dispute and opened fire at him. The guards deployed at the victim’s house retaliated, injuring Abro and killing Ahmed.

At least nine witnesses will testify Wednesday.

WASHINGTON – House lawmakers voted to raise from 18 to 21 the minimum age to buy semi-automatic rifles, following a day of poignant testimony from survivors of mass shootings, including a fourth-grader, a mother taking care of her wounded son and parents who lost a 10-year-old daughter.

The House approved raising the age from 18 to 21 as part of a package of gun reform measures that also would clamp down on gun trafficking, ban bump stocks and require safe storage of firearms. The bill, known as the Protecting Our Kids Act, heads to the Senate where it's not expected to pass because Republicans have enough votes to block gun legislation.

The measure passed the House 223-204, largely on a party-line vote.

The vote came after a full and emotional push from advocates – even actor Matthew McConaughey – who urged Congress to tighten the nation's gun laws after recent massacres in Buffalo, N.Y. and Uvalde, Texas.

Miah Cerrillo, an 11-year-old who smeared herself with her slain friend's blood to play dead during the May 24 mass shooting in Uvalde, was one of a dozen witnesses who testified Wednesday morning during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing to address gun violence.

In a pre-recorded video, she told lawmakers how she stayed alive for 78 minutes before help arrived and that she's afraid to go to school after surviving a mass shooting.

“I don’t want it to happen again.”

When asked if she thinks it will happen again, she shook her head up and down and said “yes.”

Her testimony, no matter how stirring, is unlikely to move lawmakers from their entrenched positions. Democrats supporting gun restrictions as a way to prevent mass shooting while most Republicans argued that such steps would undermine constitutional protections guaranteed by the Second Amendment.

Democrats, who have majority leadership in the House, also want to ban assault weapons, boost background checks and pass ""red flag"" laws, which allow courts to remove firearms from those deemed a threat to themselves or others.

Their bills are expected to hit a roadblock in the Senate, where Democrats do not have the 10 Republican votes needed for their bills to overcome a filibuster.

A bipartisan group of senators is negotiating a narrower gun-control package, focusing on red-flag laws, mental health and school safety.

Lawmakers are facing mounting pressure to respond to gun violence, particularly after mass shootings in Texas and New York gripped the nation last month. But few believe anything beyond modest gun reforms has a chance of passing.

Biden: Voters want action on crime, guns

President Joe Biden said Wednesday voters sent a clear message they are worried about crime in primary elections this week which saw a progressive district attorney in San Francisco removed from office amid fears that his policies had made the city less safe.

“I think the voters sent a clear message last night: Both parties have to step up and do something about crime, as well as gun violence,” Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a trip to Los Angeles.

Biden called again for more states and local governments to use funds from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to hire police officers and reform their police departments.

Kimberly Rubio, mom of Uvalde victim, haunted by last goodbye with daughter

Kimberly Rubio, whose daughter Lexi died in the Uvalde massacre, described her final moments with her daughter as she and her husband Felix attended an awards ceremony at Robb Elementary School on May 24. Lexi had earned all As and won a ""good citizen award.""

The Rubios promised to take Lexi out for ice cream that night to celebrate. They parted ways at around 11 a.m., after a picture-taking session.

""I told her we loved her and we would pick her up after school,"" said Rubio, who testified via video. ""I could still see her walking with us towards the exit. In the reel that keeps scrolling across my memories, she turns her head and smiles back at us to acknowledge my promise. And then we left.""

""I left my daughter at that school and that decision will haunt me for the rest of my life,"" Rubio said.

At 11:33 a.m. that same morning, the 18-year-old shooter arrived at Robb Elementary School. Lexi Rubio was among 19 children killed. Two teachers were killed.

Kimberly and Felix Rubio testified about their increasingly desperate search for their daughter that afternoon.

“Bus after bus arrived, but she wasn’t onboard,” Kimberly testified.

She and other family members drove to different hospitals looking for her. “At this point, some part of me must have realized that she was gone,” said Kimberly. Her worst fear was later confirmed.

Tearing up, she pleaded for lawmakers to not “want to think of Lexi as just a number. She was intelligent, compassionate and athletic. She was quiet and shy unless she had a point to make.”

Closing her testimony, Kimberly said: “Somewhere out there there's a mom listening to our testimony, thinking I can't even imagine their pain. Not knowing our reality will one day be hers, unless we act now.”

GOP lawmaker accuses Dems of traumatizing survivors

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., accused his Democratic colleagues of traumatizing mass shooting survivors, and their families, by inviting them to testify before the House committee.

He particularly called them out for having Miah Cerrillo, an 11-year-old Uvalde survivor, submit a pre-recorded video testimony, in which she relived her experience during the shooting.

Miah’s father told USA TODAY earlier in the week his daughter was testifying to “make safer schools.”

Biggs said she was forced to relive trauma “for political purposes.”

“If we’re talking about PTSD, you just prolonged it,” he said.

AOC: Volume of mass shootings ‘delegitimizing’ to the U.S.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her time to compare the number of mass shootings from 2009 through 2018 in the United States (288) to the total committed in the country’s G-7 partners - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom (five).

“Two hundred eighty-eight versus five. This is not normal,” the New York Democrat and liberal firebrand said. “Not only is it not normal, it is internationally embarrassing and delegitimizing to the United States.”

Ocasio-Cortez called the situation abhorrent.

“Because for all the billions and trillions that this body authorizes in the name of national security, we can't even keep our kids safe from their schools being turned into a war zone,” she said.

“It is just unbelievable that we will give absolute immunity to any industry in this country particularly when there’s harm and personal injury.”

Texas Rep. Pat Fallon: Smartphones, breakdown of family partly to blame for rise in mass shootings

GOP Rep. Pat Fallon from Texas said after mass shootings, “It is natural to want to focus blame.""

“We need to do something effective that will keep our children safer,” said Fallon. “Some people want to blame guns, some people want to blame gun manufacturers, some people want to blame believe it or not, the Constitution, some people want to blame an entire political party.”

Fallon said “the shooter is the only one to blame.”

But he also said there are other factors at play.

Fallon claimed mass shootings are in some measure due to “a noticeable breakdown of the family, there’s been an erosion of faith.”

Cell phones, Fallon said, also shared culpability for mass shootings.

“There’s been a seismic drop in social interactions in large measure of these dang smartphones and the proliferation of social media which is better described as anti-social media,” he said.

'Will we be recorded as such a society that accepts the sacrifice of innocents?’: Rep. Jamie Raskin

Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, opened his remarks by comparing the United States’ history of mass shootings to human sacrifices.

“In the history of our species, a number of civilizations have practiced or allowed human sacrifice, including the sacrifice of children,” said Raskin. “Will we be recorded as such a society that accepts the sacrifice of innocents?”

Raskin said the United States is “globally unique” from other countries in terms of gun violence and gun deaths. “No other nation comes close to what we see here.”

“Will we continue to accept the slaughter of innocents, including innocent children, as acceptable collateral damage for loyalty to a completely bogus and distorted misreading of the Second Amendment and what the Supreme Court has said about it?” he said.

‘Evil deeds do not transcend constitutional rights’: GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde

Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Republican from Georgia who is also a gun dealer, said “no one should weaponize or politicize these abhorrent acts to punish law abiding citizens.”

“Evil deeds do not transcend constitutional rights, it’s the other way around. Constitutional rights are the ones that transcend evil deeds,” he said.

Speaking about the Uvalde massacre, Clyde said he believes the shooting was “mostly preventable.”

Instead of stricter gun control policies. Clyde criticized President Joe Biden for being “uninterested in pursuing tighter security of schools.” He cited his military service, saying “the harder the target you are, the less likely you will be engaged by the enemy.”

He said schools should have “sensible security measures,” such as single points of entry and “a volunteer force of well trained and armed staff in addition to a school resource officer.”

‘No match’: Buffalo police commissioner says slain ex-officer had no chance against AR-15

Joseph Gramaglia, the police commissioner of Buffalo, New York, praised retired police officer Aaron Salter Jr, who was fatally shot trying to protect customers at the Buffalo supermarket that left 10 people dead.

The shooter ""should have never been able to have access to the weapons he used,"" the police commissioner said, uring Congress to act on gun reform. ""Congress must act immediately to close the loopholes in our current system and the caps that allow easy access to military-style weapons.""

Deadliest weekend in the US for mass shootings this year: 3 days, many guns, 17 fatalities

NYC Mayor Adams pushes for federal gun laws: “It’s more than what we do locally.”

New York City Mayor Eric Adams told lawmakers federal action is needed, as guns coming from out of state are out of local government’s control. Adams also emphasized the impact one gun can have.

One of the 3,000 illegal guns the New York Police Department seized “was stolen in July 27, 2020. It was used in six acts of violence. Individual cases shooting individuals, shooting into a random crowd, the gun found its way on the streets of New York.”

“It’s more than what we do locally. We need the assistance of the federal government to stop the flow of guns in our cities.”

A community in pain:Uvalde forever changed after tragic shooting

'We are a nation of gun violence survivors'

Nick Suplina, Senior Vice-President of Law and Policy for Everytown for Gun Safety, told the House Committee the latest string of mass shootings shows it is “a uniquely American problem.”

He pointed out to lawmakers that mass shootings only make up a small fraction of gun deaths compared to “homicides, suicides, and unintentional shootings.”

“We estimate that one half of all Americans have been touched by gun violence either directly or through someone they care for. In other words, we are a nation of gun violence survivors,” said Suplina.

Suplina directed criticism towards the gun industry. “The gun industry is using fear to sell guns and it believes that mass shootings are great for gun sales. They are making money on these tragedies,” said Suplina.

‘Frustrated, heartbroken’: Former teacher says inaction is acceptance

Becky Pringle, now president of the National Education Association, spoke to the House Committee about her time as a teacher watching mass shootings unfold.

“As a teacher with three decades of experience, I am frustrated, I am heartbroken, I am angry, that this is where we are 23 years after Columbine,” said Pringle. She and her fellow teachers had been falsely comforted “by the belief that this society would never let it happen again,” she said.

“But the list continued to grow didn’t it? Virginia-Tech, Sandy Hook, Marjorie Stoneman Douglass, and now Robb Elementary.”

“Is this who we are? Is it?” asked Pringle. “Our country has already experienced nearly 240 mass shootings in 2022 alone.” If trends continue, Pringle says there will be 22,255 more gun-related deaths this year.

“Inaction equals acceptance of the unacceptable,” said Pringle.

Gun violence 'killing more Americans than war': New York City Mayor Eric Adams pleads for action

New York City Mayor Eric Adams testified to members of Congress in support of stronger gun control policies

“We are facing a crisis that is killing more Americans than war. A crisis that is now the number one cause of death for our young people. A crisis that is flooding our cities faster than we can take them off the street,” said Adams.

Adams told the House committee the New York Police Department so far this year has seized over 3,000 illegal guns and said there is no indication the flow of illegal weapons will stop.

Armed man arrested near Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh's home

Even as the House hearing was underway, news emerged that an armed man, who allegedly made threats against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was arrested early Wednesday near the justice's Maryland home, according to a court spokesperson.

The suspect, who was not immediately identified, was arrested about 1:50 a.m., and transported to a local Montgomery County, Maryland Police district.

'Something needs to change': Miah Cerrillo’s father testifies

Speaking through tears, Miguel Cerrillo implored Congress to act on gun reform.

The father of 11-year-old Uvalde survivor Miah Cerrillo cried as he talked about nearly losing her in the mass shooting.

“I wish something will change not only for kids, but every single kid in the world because schools are not safe anymore,” he said. “Something needs to change.”

‘I don't want it to happen again,' Miah Cerrillo testifies

The most powerful voice in the hearing came from fourth-grader Miah Cerrillo, an 11-year-old who survived the Uvalde mass shooting with unbearable ingenuity.

She smeared her murdered friend’s blood on herself to play dead and stay alive. She called 911 for help, though help didn’t arrive for more than an hour.

Miah told members of Congress Wednesday about her fears and why she wants change.

“I don’t feel safe at school,” she said in a pre-recorded video. “I don’t want it to happen again.”

When asked if she thinks it will happen again, she shook her up and down and said “yes.”

Uvalde pediatrician haunted by memories

Dr. Roy Guerrero, a pediatrician at Uvalde Memorial Hospital, said he is haunted by memories of screams and bloodshed from the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School.

“I will never forget what I saw that day,” he said.

He saw parents sobbing – the mothers’ cries he will never get out of his head.

He saw fourth-grader Miah Cerrillo in the hallway, her white shirt covered in blood and her shoulder bleeding from shrapnel.

Guerrero knew her as the girl who survived liver surgery as a baby. On May 24, she was a survivor of a mass shooting.

School was almost out in two days. He expected to be treating sprained ankles from summer camp. Instead, he treated wounds from an assault rifle and saw the children who were “decapitated” in the massacre.

Buffalo shooting victim’s mother: Lawmakers who don’t support stricter gun laws ‘should be voted out’

Zeneta Everhart, the mother of Zaire Goodman, a survivor of the Buffalo shooting delivered impassioned testimony to the House committee.

""Parents who provide their children with guns should be held accountable,"" Everhart said. She said lawmakers need to pass stricter gun laws, saying those who do not support such changes are allowing mass shootings to continue and “should be voted out.""

As Buffalo victims testify:Race and history circle us

Everhart described her son’s injuries in detail and said lawmakers who don't support change should come to her house and clean his bullet wounds.

“My son Zaire has a hole in the right side of his neck, two on his back, and another on his left leg, caused by an exploding bullet by an AR-15,"" she told the committee. ""As I cleaned his wounds, I could feel pieces of that bullet in his back. Shrapnel will be left inside of his body for the rest of his life.""

She added: ""If after hearing from me and the other people testifying here today, does not move you to act on gun laws, I invite you to my home to help me clean Zaire's wounds.""

‘A uniquely American tragedy’

Rep. Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, launched Wednesday’s hearing by saying she wanted to “examine the destruction and heartbreak” gripping the nation after the recent series of mass shootings, including one in her home state of New York.

On May 14, in a Buffalo supermarket, an 18-year-old killed 10 Black shoppers in what the FBI described as a racially motivated mass shooting.

Ten days later, an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.

“We are failing our children, and we are failing each other,” Maloney said in her opening remarks.

She said gun violence is the leading cause of death for children and “a uniquely American tragedy.”

Maloney emphasized that she supports the Second Amendment, but she doesn’t support outdated gun laws that allow 18-year-olds to get weapons of war and carry out violent crimes.

Three GOP witnesses added to hearing

The Republicans are adding two witnesses to deliver testimony during Wednesday morning’s House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on gun control.

Lucretia Hughes, of the DC Project and Women for Gun Rights, will be part of the first panel of witnesses, along with with Miah Cerrillo and families of victims. Amy Swearer, a legal fellow with the Heritage Foundation, will speak during the second panel, which also includes gun-safety advocates and the Buffalo police commissioner.

What we know about the House hearing

The hearing Wednesday comes during an emotionally charged week on Capitol Hill. It began with a rally Monday for gun safety laws and has included tense negotiations in the Senate, heated debate in the House and passionate hearings in both chambers.

McConaughey, a native of Uvalde, has been meeting with members of both parties to encourage them to work together, he said during a White House briefing Tuesday.

Lawmakers are facing mounting pressure to respond to the scourge of violence, particularly after mass shootings in Texas and New York gripped the nation last month.

Members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee will hear from a young survivor, victims' parents, a community pediatrician, advocates and others who are reeling from trauma after the mass killings on May 24 at Robb Elementary in Uvalde and the May 14 racially motivated massacre of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket in a Black neighborhood.

The committee said the hearing will examine ""the urgent need for Congress to pass commonsense legislation that a majority of Americans support.""

Democrats who have majority leadership on the committee want to ban assault weapons, boost background checks and pass ""red flag"" laws, which allow courts to remove firearms from those deemed a threat to themselves or others.

Hearing details:Uvalde and Buffalo survivors, families to testify before House Oversight committee on mass shootings

What we know about the House Oversight and Reform Committee

The large committee that will hear the testimony includes 25 Democrats and 19 Republicans.

Democratic members include Maloney, who is in an intense primary battle with fellow New York Democrat Jerry Nadler; Jamie Raskin, who is also busy this week on the Jan. 6 committee this week investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive who has been calling for reform; Cori Bush, Ayanna Pressley and others.

Republican members include Jim Jordan, an outspoken Republican member of the GOP Freedom Caucus who opposes most gun restrictions; Andy Biggs of Arizona; Nancy Mace of South Carolina; Byron Donalds and Scott Franklin of Florida, where reform measures have passed, and others.

A push for reform

The House Oversight and Reform committee is the latest panel to examine the gun violence epidemic.

House Judiciary members last week passed a package of six bills, dubbed the Protecting Our Kids Act, that passed along party lines.

'Shame on us!':House committee passes gun bills that are likely to die in Senate

Senate committees this week are holding hearings on gun laws and white nationalism, which the FBI said was a factor in the Buffalo shooting.

The full House will vote on the Protecting Our Kids Act, a ""red flag"" bill and an assault weapons ban this week, according to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But all those measures are expected to hit a roadblock in the Senate, where Democrats do not have the 10 Republican votes needed for their bills to survive a filibuster.

Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., are leading a bipartisan group of senators in negotiations on a narrower gun-control package than House Democrats.

The senators' plans focus on red-flag laws, mental health and school safety.

As of Tuesday night, those Senate negotiations were ongoing.

Half of Republicans support stricter gun laws, poll shows

As lawmakers hash out bipartisan negotiations on Capitol Hill, an exclusive USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds half of Republicans support stricter gun laws.

The increase in GOP support – from 35% last year to 50% this month – marks a double-digit increase after a series of horrific mass shootings at schools, stores, streets and houses of worship.

A party shift ""could boost the prospects for Congress to tighten federal gun laws, an effort that has failed for decades,"" according to previous coverage.

GOP senator now open to reform

Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, of Wyoming, who has rigidly supported Second Amendment rights and earned a ""lifetime A-plus"" rating from the National Rifle Association,doesn't seem to be an obvious choice to support bipartisan efforts to reforming the nation's gun safety laws.

But the number of constituents calling her office have made her rethink her position.

""I've been a little surprised at the phone calls we've been getting and how receptive Wyoming callers seem to be to address guns in some manner,"" she told CNN. ""I am of the opinion that it's more of a mental health issue than a gun issue. But, you know, I'm listening to what people from Wyoming are saying.""

She is considering voting for bipartisan measures in the Senate that would change ""red flag"" laws, open juvenile criminal records, and boost mental health programs and school security.

""That's something that I'd be inclined to want to look at,"" Lummis told CNN.

https://www.cities929.com/2022/06/02/court-denies-petition-seeking-to-block-amendment-1-from-ballot-plaintiffs-to-appeal/,Court denies petition seeking to block Amendment 1 from ballot; plaintiffs to appeal,"(The Center Square) – A Sangamon County Circuit Court judge on Thursday denied a petition that sought to block an amendment that would codify union powers in the Illinois state constitution from appearing on the November ballot.

The case was brought by parents and teachers from Chicago Public Schools and claims that Amendment 1 would unconstitutionally enshrine union powers in the Illinois Constitution, making it impossible for lawmakers to curb union powers and giving union contracts more weight than state law. They say that violates federal law governing labor relations.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs from Liberty Justice Center and Illinois Policy Institute say they will appeal.

The lawsuit was filed on April 21 in the Seventh Judicial Circuit Court in Sangamon County.

The petition seeks to block the Illinois Right to Collective Bargaining Amendment, also known as Amendment 1. Amendment 1 was approved in May 2021 with the passage of Senate Joint Constitutional Amendment 11 for the Nov. 8, 2022 ballot.

Mailee Smith of the Illinois Policy Institute explained where they stand in their quest to remove the amendment from the ballots after the court’s decision.

“The order denying the plaintiffs petition can be appealed to the appellate court,” Smith said. “The Illinois Policy Institute and the Liberty Justice Center do plan on appealing this case on behalf of the plaintiff.”

The court’s decision to block the petition was based on the process the lawmakers took in adding the amendment to the November ballot. The judge deemed that because lawmakers got the amendment on the ballot legally, they cannot petition to have it removed.

Smith said this could lead to other questionable amendments being added to future ballots.

“This means lawmakers could ban any speech, for example, related to the governor, or some other clearly unconstitutional scheme,” Smith said. “Those would have to remain on the ballot based on this court’s decision.”

Liberty Justice Center President Jacob Huebert released a statement after the court’s ruling.

“The state is asking voters to consider an amendment that contradicts federal law and is therefore unconstitutional. The parents and teachers bringing this legal challenge have the right to block the state from using public funds to promote an unconstitutional ballot measure,” Huebert said. “We will make this argument on appeal and continue to work toward removing this unlawful measure from the ballot.”

If the LJC and IPI lose the appellate process, the amendment will remain on the November ballot.",Q2

Redlick is accused of killing her husband in their Winter Park home in 2019.

She was back on the stand on Wednesday, but this time she faced prosecutors. Question after question, they tried to chip away at her credibility.

The state questioned why she would have dropped the knife in the moments after Michael Redlick was stabbed if she still felt threatened. Danielle Redlick testified that she stabbed her husband, former UCF executive Michael Redlick, in self-defense after he tried to smother her.

Prosecutors focused on what she told dispatchers early on – initially saying that Michael may have had a heart attack.

State: ""You did not believe he had a heart attack?""

Danielle Redlick: ""Actually, I did. I was hoping.""

State: ""Hoping?""

Danielle Redlick: ""Not in a morbid sense like I wanted him dead. But, he had heart problems and I thought with all the excitement – perhaps he died.""

State: ""If he had a heart attack – wouldn’t be responsible for his death.""

Danielle Redlick: ""Yes.""

| Watch the trial in the FOX 35 News App |

During re-direct, the Defense hoped to show Redlick was not a cold-blooded killer one last time before she left the stand. Her attorneys asked her again about what she’d done in the hours after Michael had died and before she called 9-1-1.

Defense: ""You recall that night ever searching for how to clean a crime scene?""

Danielle Redlick: ""No.""

Defense: ""You recall that night ever searching for how to dispose of evidence?""

Danielle Redlick: ""No.""

The defense also called on witnesses who confirmed they’d previously seen Danielle with injuries - further highlighting the history of domestic violence in their relationship. One witness was another parent who’d watched the Redlick’s son. She noted Danielle had a black eye when they met for a play date between their sons.

The defense also called the physician who knew the Redlicks when Michael worked with the Memphis Grizzlies. Danielle testified they’d visited his office after a violent fight.

Jurors were dismissed early. Closing arguments and jury deliberations are expected on Thursday. You can watch the trial live starting at 9 a.m. in the player above.

(Courtesy of Karen Mason)

FLORIDA — Florida beach residents and conservationists are hailing the signing of a bill by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a victory, finally permitting cities and counties to keep cigarette butts off beaches, something Florida communities have been attempting since 2003.

DeSantis signed House Bill 105 Friday that builds on a 2002 state constitutional amendment, the Florida Clean Indoor Air Act, that prohibited smoking in restaurants and other indoor workplaces. Senate sponsor Joe Gruters (R-Sarasota), who unsuccessfully sponsored the bill every year since 2019, said the intention of the bill was to rid beaches of cigarette butts that don’t quickly biodegrade and pose a hazard to marine life and shore birds.

“If you live near a beach, the number one picked-up item consistently on an annual basis over and over again are cigarette butts,” Gruters said. The bill was struck down in past years becuase of heavy lobbying efforts by the tobacco industry.

According to Tobacco-Free Life, even if they’re dropped on the land, cigarette butts can find their way into the ocean, causing a choking hazard and leaching toxic chemicals into the water, posing a risk to many forms of marine life. While taking her daily walk on St. Pete Beach in June 2019, Largo resident Karen Mason snapped some disturbing photos of a black skimmer mother, a seabird that nests each summer on Gulf beaches, feeding a discarded cigarette butt to her newborn chick.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Institute in St. Petersburg said the mother bird most likely mistook the cigarette butt for one of the silver-white minnows in the Gulf that serve as the birds' main source of food. Mason's photo went viral, appearing in media around the world and prompting environmentalists to renew their efforts to ban smoking on beaches.

See related story: Butts Off The Beach: Black Skimmer Feeds Cigarette Butt To Chick Over the years, a number of Florida cities and counties tried to pass smoking prohibitions on beaches; however, a provision in Florida statutes expressly pre-empted the regulation of smoking to the state. That pre-emption was upheld in 2011, when the Florida attorney general concluded that St. Johns Water Management District could not prohibit smoking on district property, and again in 2017, when the courts upheld the pre-emption after Sarasota tried to ban smoking in parks and was challenged by the ACLU. The smoking ban at beaches bill, among 37 bills signed by DeSantis Friday, removed that pre-emption, opening the door for cities and counties to adopt smoking prohibitions at city- and county-owned beaches. Sen. Jason Brodeur (R-Lake Mary) added an amendment to HB 105 on Feb. 18 providing an exemption for ""the smoking of unfiltered cigars.""

Due to the lack of plastic filters that don't biodegrade or contain toxic chemicals, cigars aren't a danger to marine life, Brodeur argued. The amendment came as a relief to major cigar factories in Ybor City, suchas the historic J.C. Newman Cigar Co., the last cigar factory remaining in Ybor City, now operated by a third generation of the Newman family. Ybor City's tradition of creating hand-rolled cigars is a significant source of tourism in Tampa. Factories attract daily tours of visitors eager to see cigar makers hand roll cigars in the same time-honored tradition of the original factories. At one time, more than 200 cigar factories operated in Ybor City manufacturing more than 500 million cigars every year and leading to Ybor City's nickname, ""Cigar City."" The cigar industry has been cited by historians as a major factor in Tampa's development into a major metropolitan Florida city.",Q2
https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/05/12/the-partisan-divided-in-early-voting-could-mean-trouble-in-non-partisan-races,The partisan divide in early voting could mean trouble in non-partisan races,"People have been rounding up early voting totals based on the numbers choosing Republican or Democratic ballots.

Unsurprisingly, Republican voting is generally far greater than Democratic voting. There are more contested Republican primary races and some hotly contested major offices in a state that has moved solidly into the Republican column.

Only Pulaski County, among the counties I’ve seen, shows a slight edge for Democratic voters so far — 2,554 voters in the Democratic primary and 2,252 in the Republican primary.

But get a load of voting yesterday in Faulkner County, 685 Republicans and 115 Democrats. That six-to-one margin may bode ill for the non-partisan Conway school board elections, where the Republican-encouraged battle against education is in full flower. Race, sex, history, books. You know the drill. No fear too unreasonable to demagogue.

Or maybe not. I know some Democrats in Conway who are voting in the Republican primary to back the better of bad choices. Also, the school board races are non-partisan and so voters won’t know the leanings of the candidates from the ballot.

Let us hope.

Republicans have long wanted school elections on regular election days, not on their own day in September as they were for years, so more votes would be cast. The theory is that a greater number of voters, with less interest in schools, would be more likely to defeat tax proposals. The politicizing of school board races on a national level adds another troubling dimension.

Little Rock is having its school election in November. To the extent that the November turnout is more representative of the state as a whole, that might be the better choice for all school districts.

Another stray thought about the partisan divide in voter turnout. Non-partisan judicial elections will be decided in the May primary, too, unless a race requires a runoff. As I’ve mentioned before, candidates for Arkansas Supreme Court are increasingly identifying as Republicans as a political tactic. That could mean trouble for incumbent court members who are running, as they should, as non-partisan arbiters.",Q2
https://www.wadenapj.com/news/local/this-historic-central-minnesota-park-is-almost-unrecognizable-after-a-tornado-flattened-it,This historic central Minnesota park is almost unrecognizable after a tornado flattened it,"STAPLES — ""It's hard to comprehend the extent of the devastation until you see it,"" Bob Swenson, a Wadena County Park Board member said while standing among a battlefield of fallen oak trees at Old Wadena County Park, northwest of Staples.

He along with other board members, on Wednesday, June 22, were getting a look at what was once Wadena County's most iconic county park. It was a setting filled with towering oak trees on a high overlook above the pristine waters of the Crow Wing River.

It's now a tangled mess of fallen trees including some 30-40 acres of pine plantation and oaks with nary a tree left unsnapped in the path of a Memorial Day EF-2 tornado that spawned out of a large storm system that caused damage throughout central Minnesota.

An aerial view above Old Wadena shows the damage inflicted on trees and the pavilion that's now gone. Contributed / Wadena County Sheriff's Office

Wadena County parks maintenance supervisor ""Ranger Glenn"" Motzko is a one-man care taker for this park like all nine Wadena County parks. Getting the phone call on that May 30 night about took his breath away. He was busy cleaning up from the storm as it passed through in Parkers Prairie when he took a call from someone who happened to get a first look at Old Wadena. They told him the beloved park was gone.

It's not exactly gone, but it's certainly not what it once was, or had become over the last 40 years.

The park board met there to go over steps to move towards recovery at the site. Minnesota DNR Forestry staff surveyed the area and they plan to bid out clearing of the trees by the first of July. Once that's complete, the group will be able to take a better look at what they are working with. It was mentioned that they may at some point be seeking volunteers to help cleanup the park. Heavy discussions on rebuilding the park will take place in the fall.

The latest centerpiece for the park was a large pavilion, just completed in 2018. It was completely ripped apart and parts of the steel roof are now laying scattered in the toppled pines. Preliminary talks are to replace the pavilion. The foundation was damaged slightly and all poles snapped. This structure would be one item covered by insurance.

""It's done many weddings and graduation parties so far,"" Wadena County parks administrator Deana Malone said of the new pavilion. A graduation party had just taken place at the site prior to the storm.

""Thank the good Lord they were all out of here by 10 on Sunday,"" Malone said.

Malone is clearly saddened by the damage at the park but is hopeful for what can be made of the park following these changes.

""I got kind of choked up because I'll never see it like that again in my lifetime,"" Malone said.

Early talks include adding some large trees back to the grassy campground area to replace the destroyed trees. Swenson mentioned trying to preserve an oak tree stump so people can remember the damage that changed the face of the park.

Malone shared that it's quite possible that the park could be reopened in the fall at least for day use if not for camping.

Currently, the road to the park is closed. The county asks people not to enter the park as it's currently unsafe to walk around with so many fallen trees. Walking paths are impassable at this time. Malone and Motzko were able to make their way from the campground to the Little Round Hill, the area of the historic battle site. That area of the park did not sustain much damage.

Severe storms so far this year have been plentiful







Motzko has been working to preserve and improve the county parks for 24 years. He can remember this place even before that when it wasn't a park, growing up in the area as a kid. The pine plantation that was knocked flat was once a farm field back in the 1960s before the county obtained the property and turned it into a county park in 1964.

""You've got to preserve it,"" Motzko said. He's had more than a few conversations with people over the decades who have done senseless acts to make a mess of the parks. He said things have gotten better. But this natural disaster will take years to recover from.

While much was lost, some people have inquired about the park's perhaps best known tree, the Warrior Tree, a massive white pine that's been around since the 1800s. It's still standing tall just above the bog walk which is also safe and sound, still afloat. An old ox cart that was built last year and set on display was narrowly missed by falling oak trees. Another small shelter and diorama in the park were untouched.

Old Wadena had 80 individual campsites rented and another five large campground reservations from May 1 to Oct 1, 2021. That's a big chunk of the camping funds the parks department won't be making this year.

""It might be open for camping his fall, but I highly doubt it,"" Malone said.

It's possible, once the site is cleared, that the park could bounce back with even more campsites in the future in the newly formed opening.

https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/great-white-shark-eats-seal-27119523,Great white shark eats seal off beach as sea turns red and man yells 'holy f***',"A Great White Shark was filmed eating a seal near a packed beach as the sea turned red with blood.

It marked the first sighting of the summer season in New England, US, with officials warning beachgoers to be careful.

The incident comes two years after the region's last fatal shark attack.

The footage was captured by Will Little on a boat near Great Point Lighthouse in Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Sunday.

The shark can be seen thrashing around in the water as people behind the camera urge the seal to escape, shouting: ""Go! Swim!""

But as the large predator strikes, one person says: ""Oh god, you can see the blood!""

Another adds: ""Holy f****!""

Blood can be seen filling the water, just a couple of hundred yards from the beach in the background of the video.

Shark season is just arriving, though is not expected to peak until late summer and early autumn in the region.

The clip was initially posted online by local news outlet Nantucket Current before being retweeted on Monday by the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy.

The AWSC tweet adds: ""As the summer season approaches, remember to report your white shark sightings to the app Sharktivity!""

Crowdsourcing these ""critical data points"" helps to reduce encounters and promote safety, according to the organisation.

New England Aquarium is working with AWSC this summer to analyse video footage gathered by the app to help keep people aware of sightings.

Beachgoers and swimmers are being urged not to wade into outer waters over waist height, with white sharks spending much of their time in water under 15 feet deep, reports NBC Boston.

Purple flags warn of sharks in New England, with authorities keen to allow beachgoers to co-exist with them as the predators rarely ever actually attacking people.

The last deadly shark attack in the region saw Julie Dimperio Holowach, from New York, killed off the coast of Maine in July 2020.

Eyewitnesses said the 63-year-old appeared to be enjoying being in the sea with her daughter and was seen laughing before the attack near Bailey Island, Harpswell.

The Sharktivity app was developed alongside the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, the Cape Cod National Seashore, and officials from Cape Cod and South Shore towns.

It aims to raise awareness of the presence of white sharks off the coast of New England which consists of the US northeastern region comprising the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

""The app sightings are fed by researchers, safety officials, and users that upload photos for confirmation,"" a statement on the AWSC website says.

""By enabling app users to report shark sightings and upload photos for confirmation, we are effectively crowd-sourcing critical data points on where sharks are spotted so as to reduce encounters and promote safety.

""Data from sharks with acoustic tags and Smart Position and Temperature Tags (SPOT) are also available on the app.""",Q2
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/us/politics/texas-immigration.html,"In Texas, a Proxy Fight Over Democrats’ Stance on Immigration","LAREDO, Texas — Just a month after President Biden took office, pledging to roll back Trump-era policies in an attempt to take a more humane approach to immigration, Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from South Texas, began to sound an alarm.

He warned that the number of migrants seeking to enter the country would rise, and soon released photos of children sleeping under tinfoil blankets at a crowded migrant processing facility in his district at the edge of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Now Mr. Cuellar, 66, has become one of the administration’s most consistent critics on immigration, appearing on Fox News and at times echoing Republicans, saying immigrants are pouring into the United States because they believe “that the border is open.”

https://dailytimes.com.pk/940324/brutal-crackdown-imran-khan-denounces-raids-on-pti-leaders-houses/,‘Brutal crackdown’: Imran Khan denounces raids on PTI leaders’ houses,"On Monday night, Punjab Police raided the homes of several PTI leaders, including former energy minister Hammad Azhar, Usman Dar, and Babar Awan. During a raid in Lahore, a police officer was shot and killed.

The development occurred just hours after Senior Vice President of the PTI Fawad Chaudhry warned the government against using force to stop the May 25 “Azadi March.”

The former minister of information stated that the government could arrest PTI leaders and employees if it so desired, but it would not be to its advantage.

According to party sources, approximately 73 workers have been arrested thus far. During a raid on the residence of a PTI leader in Lahore’s Model Town, police constable Kamal Ahmed was shot in the chest and subsequently died at a nearby hospital.

According to police, the suspect fired the bullet from the roof of a residence. DIG Operations Lahore Captain (Retired) Muhammad Sohail Chaudhry stated, “…we are still investigating, but we will not be lenient with the perpetrators.”

In the meantime, despite Fawad’s warning that force would be used against the PTI prior to the long march, police raided the homes of PTI leaders in Punjab and Islamabad.

The attacks

The police conducted a search of Hammad Azhar’s Lahore home, but he was not present.

According to sources, Lahore Police also raided the home of former PTI information secretary Farrukh Javed, but he escaped through the back door.

Sadia Sohail, a PTI representative in Lahore’s Jauhar Town, stated that her home had also been raided. She claimed that police violated the sanctity of the home’s four walls.

Mehr Naeemullah Taj, another PTI leader in Lahore, also had his home searched. He claimed that police mistreated his family and mistreated his employees.

The residences of Malik Ishtiaq and Yasir Gillani, leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), were searched by the police, but no arrests could be made because neither leader was present.

In Sialkot, the residences of former special assistant to the prime minister for information Firdous Ashiq Awan, former provincial minister Chaudhry Iqbal, and PTI leader Tahir Hundli were searched.

The residence of Usman Dar was also raided by the Sialkot Police with a large contingent. However, he was not present at his residence, according to officials.

Rana Aftab, the district president of the PTI in Sahiwal, and Kanwar Imran, another PTI leader, both claimed that their homes were raided.

The Sheikhupura Police Department conducted a raid on Mian Zafar’s residence but was unable to apprehend him due to his absence.

PTI leader Rana Sajid from Kamoke stated that his home was also raided, but that he was not present. Two of my employees were detained by the police but later released.

‘Fascist’

In response, PTI Chairman Imran Khan stated that all citizens have the right to engage in peaceful protest.

“The brutal crackdown on PTI leaders and workers in Punjab and Islamabad has once again demonstrated the familiar fascist nature of the PMLN when in power,” he stated.

“The current crackdown also raises serious questions about the handlers […] the economy is already in free fall,” said the PTI chairman.

Khan warned the “crooks and their handlers” that these undemocratic and “fascist” actions would exacerbate the country’s economic situation and lead to anarchy.

The former prime minister also asserted that the PPP, PML-N, and JUI-F marches against his government “were never halted, nor did their workers face retaliation.”

The PTI leader stated, “This is the difference between democracies and kleptocracies.”

“We will fight”

Hammad Azhar told the media that his home had been raided without a warrant, in violation of the “four walls of the house.”

“It was a cowardly act by a cowardly government, but the citizens of Lahore will react to this action by the incumbent government.” “he said.

Noting that he was still a member of the National Assembly, the former minister stated that a peaceful protest was their democratic and constitutional right.

“I am a former federal minister who is still a member of Congress because my resignation was not accepted. If this happened to me, imagine what they would do to the average person,’ he continued.

Azhar continued by saying, “We will not flee and will fight.”

Shafqat Mehmood, former minister of education and senior PTI leader, strongly condemned the raids and arrests of party members.

“The fascist government has revealed its true colors. This won’t prevent patriotic Pakistanis from fighting for their beliefs. “Shameful behavior of a foreign government and a corrupt PM,” he tweeted.

Fawad Chaudhry, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claimed on Twitter that his home was under surveillance and a raid was planned, so he had to leave.

https://jewishcurrents.org/what-the-popular-history-of-the-soviet-jewry-movement-leaves-out,What the Popular History of the Soviet Jewry Movement Leaves Out,"Over the course of this week, we’ve been making the centerpiece of the Jewish Currents Soviet Issue—a section comprehensively reconsidering the history of the Soviet Jewry movement—available online. The seven articles that make up the section can now be found here. The section grew out of what was originally supposed to be a single article pitched several years ago by Tova Benjamin, a PhD candidate studying Russian and Jewish history at NYU, but it grew into a much more elaborate and multifaceted exploration of a movement that spanned three decades and three countries.

For this week’s newsletter (subscribe here!), I called up Tova to ask her about how this section came about, what she learned in the process, and what she hopes readers will take away from it. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.

David Klion: What’s the origin story of the Soviet Jewry movement section?

Tova Benjamin: Five years ago, I took a class with my advisor at NYU, the historian Gennady Estraikh. Every year he teaches a class called “Israel, the United States, and the Soviet Union” where he looks at those three countries as a diplomatic triangle. And he devotes a good portion of the course to the postwar history of American Jews who were lobbying and building a grassroots activist movement for freedom of immigration and religious rights for Soviet Jews, and about how Jews in the Soviet Union came to reclaim or rediscover certain aspects of their Jewish identity, especially Zionism and the Hebrew language. He said that with the opening of the archives, historians have been able to see how activists successfully made Soviet Jewish emigration and religious freedom a big problem for American and Soviet officials. That really interested me, so I ended up writing a research paper on the topic. Because of my own background growing up Chabad and with these stories about Chabad in the Soviet Union, I was initially very interested in Chabad’s involvement in the Soviet Jewry movement. But gradually I became much more interested in the memory of the movement in general. I was reading all this stuff these Jewish organizations were publishing about this history, reminiscing about Jewish unity and human rights, and something felt off.

This wasn’t just a liberal human rights movement; it was an American movement in opposition to the Soviet Union happening during the Cold War. It was this massive movement, resulting in some of the largest and most concentrated Jewish political efforts from Jews in US history, but when the Soviet Union collapsed, the whole movement basically disappeared, just ended anticlimactically. After 1991, people started making these very outlandish claims about how the movement caused the Soviet Union to collapse, or helped end the Cold War. A lot of major figures in contemporary Jewish organizations came up through activism within the Soviet Jewry movement and developed very intense nostalgia for a time when, as they would put it, Jews all came together around this Jewish cause. This nostalgia feels like a reaction to Jews who oppose Israel’s occupation, contrasting this supposed unity over Soviet Jewry to today’s splits over Zionism.

There was a lot of writing in the early 2000s about how the Soviet Jewry movement grew out of Jewish involvement in the civil rights movement, when Jews felt alienated from Black freedom movements and were searching for a “Jewish cause,” but the more I looked into it, the more false that seemed. With the notable exception of Abraham Joshua Heschel and Glenn Richter, almost none of these activists came out of civil rights. In 2010, Gal Beckerman wrote When They Come For Us, We’ll Be Gone, which cemented a lot of these popular stories about how Jews in America rescued Soviet Jews and helped end the Cold War, and in many ways that was the last word on the movement for a while. In the past ten years, there has been almost no pushback on the accepted story about the movement that shaped our parents’ generation and helped form the inward-looking attitude of American Jewish institutions as we know them today. And I realized that there hadn’t been a popular retelling that wasn’t offering a triumphant story about Jews uniting over their identity across borders and successfully emigrating to Israel, which felt like a reflexively Zionist narrative. So about four years ago, I pitched a revisionist piece to Jewish Currents that would reframe the narrative of the Soviet Jewry movement in the US as an origin story for contemporary Jewish identity politics, because of the way American activists for Soviet Jewry crafted a Jewish culture of protest to push their cause.

DK: What was the journey from that initial pitch to the section that we ended up getting in the Soviet issue four years later?

TB: Initially, [JC Editor-in-Chief] Arielle Angel accepted the pitch. She was also very interested in the Jewish identity politics angle. So I tried writing a 3,000-word piece, and right away I realized it was very unwieldy: first of all, because it’s a 30-year history of a movement spread between three countries that involved many different organizations and individuals across the political and Jewish spectrum, and second, because I was trying to speak to multiple audiences. The audience needed to include people who participated and remember it triumphantly; an older generation of Jewish Currents readers, who would have opposed it as a nationalist and Zionist movement; and a younger generation who had barely—or maybe never—heard of it; as well as some people whose emigration or parent’s emigration was aided by these activist efforts. I was trying to revise the narrative of what the movement was and also introduce it at the same time, which became very difficult. The 3,000-word piece turned into a 6,000-word piece, and then we tried to cut it back down.

Eventually, Arielle called me and said we should actually make this a whole issue, with a special advisory board of artists and academics and people who have personal relationships to these histories. I had the task of curating a whole section where my original reframing of this history would serve as an introduction. I started rethinking what the section was going to be, because I realized we would have the space to tell the global story, as opposed to a mainly American story.

DK: How did you go about finding the specific contributors to the section and figuring out the specific topics they would be addressing?

TB: We wanted each piece to stand individually on its own, but we also wanted to collectively tell a story. I knew that Hadas Binyamini was working on the links between the Soviet Jewry movement and neoconservatism around the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, and she sent us a really great pitch about that. Jonathan Dekel-Chen pitched us something more general, but also mentioned he’d been doing this original research on Israel and its involvement in the movement so we helped him shape a piece that could fit. Olesya Shayduk-Immerman pitched us on something completely different than what we eventually ended up with; we found the angle for that piece in conversation with her. She ended up writing about the way these refusenik exile-to-exodus narratives themselves are made, and how asking different questions of Soviet emigrants produced surprising answers. With Anna Shternshis’s piece about Soviet antisemitism, we sought it out. We realized that we needed to address what was happening in the Soviet Union, or the section would fall apart. A lot of people in the US and Israel had altruistic intentions, but they were out of touch, sometimes to a laughable or offensive extent, with what was happening in the Soviet Union. Something I’m really happy about is that in the end, three of the seven pieces are about what was happening on the Soviet side: Olesya’s, Anna’s, and Emily Tamkin’s piece, which looks at those dissidents in the Soviet Union who weren’t celebrated by American Jewish activists to the same extent as refuseniks were, but who articulated another kind of Jewish future.

Anna’s was the last one we commissioned, and I think it ended up being the glue for the whole section. She really gets into the history of antisemitism in the Soviet Union, a history I don’t think a lot of American Jews really understand, and that is still contentious. A lot of today’s discussions about antisemitism on the left have their origins in assumptions about Communists, and especially Jews who joined the Communist Party. Anna’s work is based on hundreds of oral interviews, and she does a really good job of breaking down what was actually happening and balancing out these often bad faith debates. She shows that yes, there was a lot of anti-Jewish sentiment, but that wasn’t actually what motivated people to leave. Meanwhile, on the US side, we see people weaponizing Soviet antisemitism to such an extent it gets compared to the Holocaust, with some even describing it as a “spiritual genocide.”

We also had Larry Bush, the former editor of Jewish Currents, go through the archives to show how the magazine covered the movement at the time. Jewish Currents started out as kind of a Stalinist rag. After the murder of the Yiddish poets in 1952, they published some editorials trying to reckon with what they had previously ignored about Stalin and Soviet antisemitism. They continued publishing editorials throughout the Cold War years trying to grapple with how to oppose Soviet crimes without joining the Cold Warriors, who they saw as including fellow American Jews involved in the Soviet Jewry movement. I became really fascinated with these writings, and we picked a few of them out of the archives and asked Larry to read through them, reframe them, and introduce them for us. I think that’s really cool, both for older Jewish Currents readers who remember the movement, nostalgically or not, and for younger readers to see where Jewish Currents stood at the time and how the publication today relates to its own history.

DK: What did you learn that surprised you and that you didn’t know when you set out to do this?

TB: In Hadas’s piece about how Democratic hawks co-opted the Soviet Jewry movement, I was very surprised to learn about the grassroots support for neoconservatives. From her work, I understand that historians usually think of neocons as not really having a larger base. At the time the movement started, the legacy Jewish establishment organizations were less interested in particularist politics—that is, in supporting specifically Jewish causes. That was a push that came from activists on the ground.

I had also previously assumed that in Israel, these efforts were driven by clandestine intelligence services working behind the scenes, and not by a grassroots movement. Jonathan’s piece really surprised me, because he completely overturns that assumption. You actually find a similar story in all three countries, where activists start pushing Jewish communal leaders and their governments to invest in “Jewish issues.”

I also revised some of my own understandings of the movement, and began to see it as a bigger story about Jewish belonging in the long view of the 20th century, and how activists in the US and Israel were actually articulating competing visions of where a Jewish future could be, which ended up being the framing for the section.

DK: How has the section been received so far, and what impact are you hoping it will have?

TB: When Arielle and I were first developing my piece, the question of what it means to use your identity as a Jew in your organizing seemed really pertinent. A lot of people who study the movement say that American Jews were searching for a cause, and for a way to deal with guilt about the Holocaust, and that was funneled into the Soviet Jewry movement. I first started working on this when the Never Again movement was active, around when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez referred to refugee camps on the Mexican border as “concentration camps.” There was a lot of anger from some Jewish establishment figures about her use of Holocaust comparisons, and a lot of Jewish organizers on the left felt that they could flip that on its head and use it themselves. What really interested me about the Never Again movement was how the protests were using Jewish religious rituals in a way that was very similar to the Soviet Jewry movement, with the difference being that it was less particularist and more universalist now.

With the Soviet Jewry movement, I wondered what made it so easy for anti-communists and neoconservatives to co-opt this issue and to fit it into their policy agendas? Does that delegitimize the movement, if you’re operating under a banner that a Jewish terrorist like Meir Kahane can join beneath as well? I hope readers can use this history of one of the most significant Jewish political organizing efforts in the US to think about organizing today. Who did this movement serve, and to what end?

In terms of responses to the issue, it’s been really nice to see academics who work on this respond positively, especially the many historians whose work the section builds upon; we had felt a little nervous because it’s revisionist, and it’s pushing back on a lot of these established narratives. But people are really excited to see something that’s rethinking a movement that they remember or participated in. Arielle’s mom considers herself very much a liberal Jew, and she was very involved in the movement and was really excited to read some of the pieces, especially the one about the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. She said something like, “we were just too naive to realize what was happening at the time.” I gave it to my grandma who read all the pieces, and told me that she walked away with a revised sense of a story she thought she knew. She said that reading the pieces made her want to stop donating to the AJC. That’s the outcome I’d like to see, for grandmas to stop donating to the AJC.",Q2

BUFFALO, N.Y. — The white gunman accused of massacring 10 Black people in a racist rampage at a Buffalo supermarket planned to keep killing if he had escaped the scene, the police commissioner said Monday, as the possibility of federal hate crime or domestic terror charges loomed.

The gunman, who had crossed the state to target people at the Tops Friendly Market, had talked about shooting up another store as well, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia told CNN.

""He was going to get in his car and continue to drive down Jefferson Avenue and continue doing the same thing,” the commissioner said.

The commissioner's account was similar to portions of a racist 180-page document, purportedly written by Payton Gendron, that said the assault was intended to terrorize all nonwhite, non-Christian people and get them to leave the country. Federal authorities were working to confirm the document's authenticity.

Gendron, 18, traveled about 200 miles (320 kilometers) from his home in Conklin, New York, to commit the attack, police said. Authorities said he wielded an AR-15-style rifle, wore body armor and used a helmet camera to livestream the bloodbath on the internet.

Federal prosecutors said they are contemplating federal hate crime charges in the case.

Garnell Whitfield Jr., who lost his 86-year-old mother, Ruth Whitfield, asked how the country could allow its terrible history of racist killings to repeat itself.

“We’re not just hurting. We’re angry. We’re mad. This shouldn’t have happened. We do our best to be good citizens, to be good people. We believe in God. We trust Him. We treat people with decency, and we love even our enemies,” Whitfield said at a news conference with civil rights attorney Ben Crump and others.

“And you expect us to keep doing this over and over and over again — over again, forgive and forget,"" he continued. ""While people we elect and trust in offices around this country do their best not to protect us, not to consider us equal.”

Whitfield's mother was killed after making her daily visit to her husband, retired Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield, in a nursing home.

""How do we tell him that she’s gone? Much less that she’s gone at the hands of a white supremacist? Of a terrorist? An evil person who is allowed to live among us?” their son said.

The victims also included a man buying a cake for his grandson, a church deacon helping people get home with their groceries and a supermarket security guard.

The bloodshed in Buffalo was the deadliest in a wave of weekend shootings, including at a California church and a Texas flea market.

Law enforcement officials said Sunday that New York State Police troopers had been called to Gendron's high school last June for a report that the then-17-year-old had made threatening statements. The threat was “general” in nature and not related to race, Gramaglia said.

Gendron had threatened to carry out a shooting at Susquehanna Valley High in Conklin around graduation, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Gramaglia said Gendron had no further contact with law enforcement after a mental health evaluation that put him in a hospital for a day and a half.

It was unclear whether officials could have invoked New York's “red flag” regulation, which lets law enforcement, school officials and families ask a court to order the seizure of guns from people considered dangerous. Authorities would not say when Gendron acquired the weapons he had during the deadly attack.

Federal law bars people from owning guns if a judge has determined they have a “mental defect” or they have been forced into a mental institution. An evaluation alone would not trigger the prohibition.

The long list of mass shootings in the U.S. involving missed opportunities to intervene includes the 2018 massacre of 17 students at a high school in Parkland, Florida, where law enforcement officials had received numerous complaints about the gunman's threatening statements, and the killings of more than two dozen people at a Texas church in 2017 by a former Air Force member who was able to buy a gun despite a history of violence.

At the White House, President Joe Biden, who planned a visit Tuesday to Buffalo, paid tribute to one of the victims, security guard and retired police officer Aaron Salter. Salter fired repeatedly at the attacker, striking his armor-plated vest at least once before being shot and killed. Biden said Salter “gave his life trying to save others.""

Authorities said that in addition to the 10 Black people killed, three people were wounded: one Black, two white.

Gendron researched the neighborhood's demographics and conducted reconnaissance before the attack, investigators said. Mayor Byron Brown said the gunman “came here with the express purpose of taking as many Black lives as he possibly could.”

Most of the victims were elders, a distinction that historically carries weight in Black communities. The same was true for several of the nine Black people killed in 2015 in a racist attack at a historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina.

The Buffalo gunman livestreamed the attack on Twitch, prompting scrutiny of how fast social platforms react to violent videos.

Portions of the video circulating online showed the gunman killing multiple shoppers in less than a minute. At one point, he trains his weapon on a white person cowering behind a checkout counter, but says, “Sorry!” and doesn’t shoot. Screenshots purporting to be from the broadcast appear to show a racial slur against Black people scrawled on his rifle.",Q2

Cumberland County property records show the Hodge Street property was purchased by the church in 2016. A number, listed for the Fayetteville church online, appears to be connected to a fax machine.

In August 2020, Veterans Education Success, an advocacy group based in Washington D.C., asked the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Georgia Veterans Service to investigate alleged abuses of the GI Bill program by House of Prayer Christian Church’s bible seminaries.

Veterans alleged the House of Prayer Christian Church ""deceives the VA during inspections and targets veterans in order to access GI Bill funding, VA disability compensation, and VA home loans,"" according to a letter from the advocacy group to the VA.

Raid near Fort Stewart

The FBI on Thursday also raided The House of Prayer Christian Church in Hinesville, Georgia. The raid took place just after 8 a.m. on the 2500 block of Airport Road.

Onlookers observed FBI agents with weapons traveling to multiple buildings while a group of women was being guarded by an officer with a weapon.

Jenna Sellitto, an FBI spokesperson, confirmed the agency was executing a court-authorized search warrant. She said no arrests had been made as of Thursday afternoon.

The House of Prayer Christian Church in Hinesville is located less than 8 miles from Fort Stewart in Liberty County.

Raid near Fort Gordon

Half a dozen FBI agents were seen in the back of the Assembly of Prayer church on Tobacco Road in Hephzibah, Georgia, during a raid that started at about 7:15 a.m. Thursday and continued into the afternoon.

According to a search of property records, House of Prayer Christian Churches owns 2952 Old Tobacco Road, the address of the Assembly of Prayer church in Richmond County.

At about 1 p.m., agents were seen using stairs at the back of the building during the investigation, according to Sgt. William McCarty with the Richmond County Sheriff's Office.

""We were there to assist them, but referring everything over to the FBI,"" said McCarty. He said he could not confirm if there were any arrests.

The Assembly of Prayer church in Hephzibah is located just outside of Gate 5 at Fort Gordon.

In an email sent Thursday, Anne H. Bowman, deputy public affairs officer at Fort Gordon, said ""Fort Gordon was aware of the organization called the Assembly of Prayer Church through our law enforcement channels but the installation had no bans against the organization or any official dealings with them (despite their websites claims).""

Bowman confirmed ""there were reports made to Fort Gordon law enforcement of recruiting/solicitation attempts by the church members but there were no incidents, confrontations, arrests or anything of this nature as a result,"" she said in another email Thursday night.

Raid near Fort Hood

The Assembly of Prayer Christian Church on Massey Street in Killeen, Texas, was also raided by the FBI on Thursday, according to the Killeen Police Department.

The church is located less than 4 miles from Fort Hood.

Killeen officers arrived to assist the FBI with traffic diversion just after 7:30 a.m., according to officials.

Ashley Demorest, a former member of the church who observed the raid, said she was a member of the church from age 15 to 23, ""until I finally escaped.""

Amber Fitz-Randolph, leader of The Ft. Hood Fallen Facebook page, which was started in 2017, said members of the church in Killeen have snuck into the barracks and threatened soldiers.

In a text message Thursday afternoon, Christopher Haug, chief of media relations at Fort Hood, said they are aware the FBI is investigating the church and their police are looking into it.

Demorest said she solicited soldiers on base as a member of the church.

""When I was 16 I would go with other members to [Fort Hood] and do what the church would call 'soul winning' to invite people to the church,"" she said.

In the Veteran's Education Success's letter to the VA and Georgia SAA in 2020, the organization cited similar solicitations.

""Soul-winning is an organized event coordinated by HOPCC’s clergy,"" noted the document. ""Five days a week, individuals are paired up and sent out to recruit new members on or around military bases. ... Students would recruit at Post Exchanges, barracks, and on-base housing.""

The document also cites specific members' experiences recruiting on bases in Georgia.

https://www.aspenpublicradio.org/2022-04-19/basalt-students-organize-a-mock-dui-scenario-before-prom,Basalt students organize a mock DUI scenario before prom,"On Monday, roughly 500 Basalt High School students gathered to watch a student-organized, mock DUI scenario with local first responders.

The scenario lasted about 30 minutes, and first responders from the Basalt Police Department, Roaring Fork Fire Rescue Authority and Classic Air pretended to administer lifesaving aid to a handful of students with fake blood and wounds across their bodies.

Gage Reuss is a senior at Basalt High and president of the student council.

Earlier this year, Reuss told his fellow council members that he wanted to host a mock DUI scenario similar to one he saw during his freshman year.

The mock presentation was ""something that obviously stayed with me for the last three years,"" Reuss said. ""So I thought it was going to be super helpful for even some of the younger students at Basalt.”

The student council organized the event to impress upon their classmates the serious consequences that may follow the decision to drink and drive.

Reuss said it really hit home for him and “touches the heartstrings a little bit about the dangers of distracted driving or the dangers of drunk driving.""

Local first responders attended to the student volunteers in the school parking lot as if they were on a real scene.

Jason Hegberg, the school resource officer with the Basalt Police Department, described how each of the different agencies played a role.

“The Pitkin County Coroner’s even up here for the tail end of it, where we placed the 'deceased' student in a body bag and carried him off to really just kind of drive that point home that, hey, this is what this looks like when it happens,” said Hegberg, who coordinated with the student council to help develop the scenario.

With prom coming up in a few weeks, Hegberg said the presentation is intended to shock them.

The student council even enlisted the mother of the student pretending to be deceased to act out her emotional response to the scenario.

“It’s really just giving them some awareness,” said Hegberg. “It’s a little bit of a show so they can see all the moving parts of what it looks like on a crash like this. So we want them to think about the possibility that this could happen.”

Ninth graders at Basalt receive some instruction in their health class during a unit about drugs and alcohol.

But by the time they are upperclassmen going to prom, it has been a few years since they’ve had any formal instruction on the subject.

Amelia Allen is a junior at Basalt High School, and she said the presentation was a harsh reminder of what can happen.

“I think, at first, it was hard to watch because you know the kids out there who are laying–acting dead out there on the ground,” said Allen. “It helps to know that it was fake, but it was still really real because it happens.”

Three years ago, Basalt High student Tyler Ribich was killed in a drunken-driving accident in Missouri Heights.

Another student, Emma Narby, said her older sister's emotions were unstable after Ribich's death.

“Watching what happened on the mock accident and seeing what it was actually like for the people involved was kind of eye-opening and made me realize how dangerous it can be to actually drive while intoxicated,” said Narby.

Allen said the scenario brought back a lot of those memories.

“We learn about that stuff in health class,” said Allen. “But I think things like this, where you can visually see your friends and actually see people you know and the whole community involved, actually have a lasting impact.”

Hegberg said these intense scenarios are intended to shock students, but it can’t be the only way educators engage kids in these conversations.

“I think if we were doing it all the time, I think the kids would shut it off,” said Hegberg. “And with the student council feeling like this is what was needed, we felt like if we’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do it in a manner that shocks them and brings home a point.”

He said that most of his time in the school is spent very differently.

“I mean, most of my time in the school is just sitting down and having chats with them and being very transparent to them,” said Hegberg. “That you know, I know what it’s like to drink too much. Those kinds of things I went through four decades ago now.”

In the next few weeks before prom, the Basalt Police Department will return with DUI goggles to show kids how people's vision is impaired when they are driving under the influence of alcohol.

Reuss reminds his fellow classmates to call a trusted adult if they need a safe ride home.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2023-05-02/gun-lawsuit-san-diego-10-day-waiting-period,Gun rights groups sue in San Diego to overturn California’s 10-day purchase waiting period,"A lawsuit filed by gun rights groups in San Diego federal court seeks to overturn California’s 10-day waiting period for new gun purchases, the latest in a growing body of cases filed locally that challenge the state’s strict firearms laws.

The lawsuit, filed Monday, claims that “a right delayed is a right denied” and that the 10-day waiting period is enforced even when a state database can confirm a person is eligible to buy a gun within minutes of submitting an application. The suit names California Attorney General Rob Bonta as the lead defendant.

“Defendants’ enforcement of the waiting period laws prevents law-abiding people from taking possession of lawfully acquired firearms for immediate self-defense and other lawful purposes — even after defendants know the individual is eligible to exercise their fundamental, constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms,” the lawsuit claims. “This relegates the right to keep and bear arms to second-class status.”

Bonta’s office released a statement Tuesday saying it received the complaint and was reviewing it. His office is expected to file a response defending the waiting-period laws in the coming weeks.

“Waiting periods for firearm purchases are a data-driven way to prevent gun violence, especially suicide,” Janet Carter, senior director of issues and appeals at Everytown Law, told the Union-Tribune in a statement Tuesday. “California’s waiting period will save lives. It is entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and it should be upheld.”

Second Amendment groups filed a similar challenge in 2011 and met initial success when a U.S. district judge in Fresno overturned the mandatory waiting period. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district judge’s ruling, keeping the waiting period in place, and in 2018 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

A lot has changed since then.

This time around, the law will be analyzed by a new legal standard that’s more friendly to those challenging gun laws. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority established the new standard last year when it struck down New York’s concealed-carry law in the case New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In its ruling, the high court said judges ruling on Second Amendment challenges must first decide if the conduct in question is constitutional based on the “Second Amendment’s plain text.” Courts then must determine if the government has shown its gun law to be “consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”

This new legal framework, typically referred to as the “text, history and tradition” standard, has forced government entities attempting to regulate modern weapons to look for closely comparable laws from around the time the Second Amendment was ratified some 230 years ago.

According to a brief filed in the first waiting-period lawsuit, California has mandated a waiting period for firearms purchases for 100 years.

The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit argue that’s not long enough to satisfy the history and tradition portions of the new legal standard. “No waiting period or any analogous laws existed in the constitutionally relevant period of history,” the lawsuit contends.

The specific laws being challenged were enacted in 2011.

California’s initial waiting period, enacted in 1923, was one day, but has varied to as long as 15 days in the 1970s, according to the friend-of-the-court brief filed by the gun-safety advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.

That same brief outlined the state’s reasoning for mandating a waiting period: It creates “a brief cooling-off period to reduce impulsive violence” and gives law enforcement enough time to determine if the prospective gun buyer is prohibited from purchasing a gun. Among the state’s list of prohibited people are those with felony convictions and certain misdemeanor convictions and people found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others because of a mental illness. People who are the subject of gun violence restraining orders and some other restraining orders are also prohibited from buying or possessing guns.

In a footnote, attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were not challenging the state’s list of prohibited people but also were not conceding the constitutionality of such prohibitions. Citing the Bruen decision, a federal appeals court in February ruled the government can’t stop people who have domestic violence restraining orders against them from owning guns.

According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, California is one of nine states and the District of Columbia that legislate waiting periods of various types and lengths. Hawaii’s 14-day waiting period is the longest, while the District of Columbia, like California, also has a 10-day waiting period. Washington state previously had a 10-day wait for semi-automatic rifles, but legislators there voted last week to expand that to all firearm purchases.

A 2017 Harvard study found that waiting periods for handgun purchases reduce gun homicides by about 17 percent and may reduce gun suicides between 7 and 11 percent. The results implied that “states … with waiting periods avoid roughly 750 gun homicides per year as a result of this policy,” the authors wrote. “Expanding the waiting period policy to all other U.S. states would prevent an additional 910 gun homicides per year without imposing any restrictions on who can own a gun.”

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed Monday include several San Diego County residents, two local gun stores, a local Second Amendment political action committee and several gun rights groups, including the Firearms Policy Coalition, the California Gun Rights Foundation and the Second Amendment Foundation.

The federal court in San Diego has become a popular venue for Second Amendment challenges, due in part to U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez’s friendly rulings.

The lawsuit filed Monday was randomly assigned to U.S. District Judge Larry Burns, but the plaintiffs could seek to get it in front of Benitez by arguing it’s related to other local Second Amendment challenges.",Q2

NEW ORLEANS — Allegedly murdering his ex-girlfriend and shooting a Tennessee officer while on the run, the crimes linked to BJ Brown, 32, were shocking, but not exactly surprising to St. John Parish Sheriff Mike Tregre.

“He is a violent, habitual, repeat offender,” Tregre said.

Tregre says Brown has been arrested at least 15 times since 2010. Court documents show a history of charges, some violent, including pursuits, drugs, assault, robbery, injuring a police dog, and resisting an officer.

“We’ve even had cases of domestic violence with him and the lady that he murdered,” said Tregre.

Monday’s murder was caught on cell phone video. It shows a man walking up to Cassandra Jones, 48, outside a New Orleans apartment complex with what appears to be an assault rifle. He shoots her multiple times.

“He should never see the light of day again and I wish we could have done something to prevent that from happening. Maybe he could have been in jail, I don’t know,” said Tregre.

Court records show Brown’s past charges in St. John Parish landed him in the parish jail for only 94 days. Some charges were either not pursued or dropped by the victim, Cassandra Jones. The only pending charges involve a high-speed crash on River Road back in October.

“He crashed into citizens who were injured, three adults and a child, where he basically totaled all vehicles and he managed to escape on foot. He turned himself in later,” said Tregre.

Tregre worries about a failure in the justice system, especially since Brown was on probation for drug charges at the time of the murder. Last month Brown was sentenced to two years probation instead of three years in jail.

Two days later, Jones filed a restraining order for domestic violence against Brown in Orleans Parish. She was killed a month and a half later. There’s now a warrant out for Brown in St. John Parish. He’s also wanted for murder in New Orleans.

“He’s definitely what I would consider a violent criminal history and a person that definitely needs to be off the streets and probably should have been off the streets a long time ago,” said Tregre.

On the run for two days, Brown was caught Wednesday morning in Houston County, Tennessee, near the town of Erin. The handcuffs used were from the officer who Brown allegedly shot and injured during a traffic stop.

“His [the officer] gear probably had a little bit of blood on it, but I didn’t wash them off because he had this officer’s blood on his hands anyway,” said Erin Police Chief Mark Moore.

Moore says his six-man department has never experienced anything like this.

“It hits home. It’s not just a fellow officer, it’s a friend, family, brother, and we take those things personally,” said Moore.

Tregre says given the evidence in the case, it should be expedited in court.

“If you commit a crime and it’s just undeniable and your guilt is obvious, this case should not take years to prosecute,” said Tregre",Q2
https://apnews.com/dcddc3437e0c3988ed942187c53c0faa,Judge: Colorado shooting suspect incompetent to stand trial,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — A judge ruled Friday that a man charged with killing 10 people at a Colorado supermarket last year is still mentally incompetent to stand trial, further delaying court proceedings in the case.

But the judge also said that assessment could change soon.

Experts at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo have said there is a substantial probability that Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 22, can be restored to competency within the “reasonable future” and remain competent by taking medications, Judge Ingrid Bakke said during a brief hearing. It is a prognosis she first mentioned in a March 11 scheduling order.

The prosecution of Alyssa has been on hold since December, when Bakke first ruled that he was mentally incompetent — unable to understand legal proceedings and work with his lawyers to defend himself.

Alissa is being treated at the state mental hospital and was not in court for Friday’s hearing. The judge set a July 21 hearing to again evaluate Alissa’s competency to stand trial.

Bakke’s ruling came nearly a month after Boulder, the home of the University of Colorado, marked the first anniversary of the attack that killed workers, customers and a police officer who rushed inside the store.

Few details have been released about Alissa’s condition. Reports on his evaluations are not available to the public, but a court filing discussing one of the evaluations last year said he had been provisionally diagnosed with an unspecified mental health condition that limits his ability to “meaningfully converse with others.”

Competency is a different legal issue than a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, which involves whether someone’s mental health prevented them from understanding right from wrong at the time a crime was committed.

After the hearing, District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the average time to restore someone to competency is six months. He declined to speculate on when Alissa, who as been at the state hospital for four months, may be considered competent.

Robert Olds, the uncle of one of the 10 people killed, front-end manager Rikki Olds, said Alissa has more rights than the victims. He remains fairly hopeful Alissa will go on trial but does not want to anticipate what will happen next because the legal process has been moving slowly.

“Eventually it will happen, I hope,” he said of a trial. “There is always that outside chance it won’t happen.”

Investigators have not released any information about why they believe Alissa launched the attack or why he may have targeted the supermarket. He lived in the nearby suburb of Arvada, where authorities say he passed a background check to legally buy the Ruger AR-556 pistol he allegedly used six days before the shooting.

The March 22, 2021, attack at a King Soopers grocery shocked a state that has seen its share of mass shootings, including the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting.

Boulder police Officer Eric Talley, a 51-year-old father of seven, was shot and killed while rushing into the store with an initial team of police officers. In addition to Rikki Olds, Denny Stong, Neven Stanisic, Tralona Bartkowiak, Teri Leiker, Suzanne Fountain, Kevin Mahoney, Lynn Murray and Jody Waters were killed inside and outside the supermarket.

His vehicle then continued south and sideswiped the back of a third vehicle before colliding with a fourth car.

The collision caused the fourth car to crash into the rear of another sedan, killing the 72-year-old driver from Palmetto Bay and seriously injuring a 57-year-old passenger from Miami.

On Wednesday, a federal judge blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to ban birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. But as real fear plagues communities in Nevada and across the country, the Silver State's nine-member Latino Caucus has said they won't stay complacent.



Assemblywoman and caucus chair Cecilia González, D-Las Vegas, said Trump's attack on immigrant families is personal for her, which is why she's introducing The Family Unity Support Act.



""This bill is seeking to ensure the protections of children's whose parents may be facing deportation proceedings,"" she said, ""so it ensures that their overall mental, scholarly and legal well-being are taken care of by the state.""



The bill's final details are still being worked out.



The White House has said the roundups taking place nationwide are targeting immigrants with criminal records, but some with no record have also been detained. Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has said any potential raids on schools would be assessed on a ""case-by-case basis,"" and determined by national-security or public-safety threats.



Assemblywoman Selena Torres-Fossett, D-Las Vegas, who is also part of the Nevada Latino Caucus, said they will look at every policy to ensure Nevada children and their families stay safe, but warned that with immigration being such a hot-button issue, more directives and actions from the White House are likely to follow.



""I think we are going to continue to see the federal government and President Trump inciting fear and hate in our schools and our communities,"" she said, ""and we will continue to fight back in every way that we can.""



In response to the federal government's actions pertaining to immigrant communities, the ACLU of Nevada has created an online portal for Nevadans to report civil liberties and civil rights violations of immigrants in the Silver State.

Idaho lawmakers have introduced a slate of bills which would put up greater hurdles for passing voter-initiated ballot measures.



Legislation this session includes bills to increase the threshold for passage to 50%, allowing the governor to veto passed measures and proposes a constitutional amendment that would require signatures from six percent of voters in all 35 districts.



Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, assistant Senate minority leader, said the measures come after years of attacks from Republicans on voter initiatives.



""They constantly live in fear that the people will tire of the Legislature not listening to them and will use the initiative process to get done that which the Legislature should do,"" Ruchti asserted.



Ruchti noted one instance in which lawmakers did not listen to Idahoans was on Medicaid expansion. In 2018, 60% of voters approved a measure to expand the program. Lawmakers have introduced a bill this session to repeal Medicaid expansion. Sponsors of ballot measure legislation argued out-of-state money drives the initiatives.



Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, who sponsored some of the bills to increase initiative thresholds, said allowing the governor to veto measures would be similar to bills passed in the Legislature. He also contended it is ""good protection for a misinformed electorate if they don't get the information like we get to have.""



Ruchti countered lawmakers deal with people who have agendas.



""We are surrounded by special interest groups who are trying to get their particular bills passed and they use a variety of arguments, some of which are specious, some of which are accurate information,"" Ruchti observed. ""It's just part of living in a democracy. So, the voters can figure this out and they do.""



Senate Joint Resolution 101 would make the signature gathering process for voter initiatives harder, increasing the number of districts where six percent of voters have to sign from 18 to all 35. The resolution would need approval from voters to amend the constitution. Lawmakers proposed the amending resolution because in 2021, the Idaho Supreme Court blocked a similar bill, calling it unconstitutional.



Ruchti added attempts like this are disrupting grassroots efforts.



""The signature gatherers, for example, as a general rule and maybe even almost entirely are volunteers who are just taking their time to do something that they feel is really important,"" Ruchti pointed out. ""That certainly was the way it was with Medicaid expansion.""

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Anne Rudin, the first woman to be elected mayor of Sacramento, was hailed as the ""most unpolitical politician."" Family, friends, and colleagues gathered to remember her Friday. Political and local luminaries of the past five decades paid tribute to Rudin at the Mayor Anne Rudin Peace Pond in William Land Park. Rudin died on Thanksgiving Day, 2021 at the age of 97.

Familiar names such as Congresswoman Doris Matsui, developer and former Kings owner Gregg Lukenbill, grocery store owner Darrell Corti, and former Sacramento Mayors Heather Fargo and Phillip Isenberg sang high praises of the soft-spoken and demure Rudin. The words, patient, fair and transparent were mentioned time and time again, by those who worked with Rudin.

Rudin was recognized for being a woman ahead of her time. She championed gay rights in the 1970s, and in 1992 enacted a domestic partners ordinance. In addition, Rudin is known for Light Rail, Sacramento's ban on assault weapons, women's rights, and spearheading the ban on smoking in public places

According to the Boston Globe, 34-year-old Kaitlin Marie Armstrong of Austin is being charged with murder. Wilson was shot ""multiple times"" a little over a week before Friday's Gravel Locos, a 150-mile race in Hico, Texas, that she was the favorite to win.

Per Ryan Autullo and Tony Plohetski of the Austin American-Statesman, Armstrong was questioned by police, who had video surveillance of a vehicle matching the one she drives arriving at Wilson's residence. Wilson had just returned home from going swimming with professional off-road cyclist Colin Strickland, who is Armstrong's boyfriend.

A police affidavit states that Strickland and Wilson became involved back in October during a ""brief break"" in his relationship with Armstrong. The two later got back together, but police say Armstrong learned of Strickland's relationship with Wilson in January. A tipster told detectives that Armstrong ""became furious and was shaking in anger"" and threatened Wilson's life.

https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/355262,Georgia Secretary of State to testify before Jan. 6 panel,"Embattled Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is set to testify on Tuesday before the House committee probing the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, The Associated Press reported Monday.

Raffensperger, along with his deputy Gabe Sterling and Arizona’s Rusty Bowers, are scheduled to be the key witnesses in Tuesday’s hearing. The focus will be on how former President Donald Trump and his allies vigorously pressured officials in key battleground states with schemes to reject ballots or entire state tallies to upend the results of the 2020 presidential election.

In a recording published by the Washington Post just days before the Capitol incident, Trump was heard pressuring Raffensperger to “recalculate” the vote count in his state, because, as he says, “I just want to find 11,780 votes.”

During the phone call, Trump tells Raffensperger that, “There’s no way I lost Georgia. There’s no way! We won by hundreds of thousands of votes,” to which Raffensperger responds, “Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, that the data you have is wrong.”

""There's nothing wrong with saying, you know, that you've recalculated,"" Trump continues. ""You should want to have an accurate election - and you're a Republican.""

""We believe we do have an accurate election,"" Raffensperger is heard replying.

""No you don't. You don't have. Not even close. You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes,"" Trump fires back.

While the House committee cannot charge Trump with any crimes, the Justice Department is watching the panel´s work closely. Trump’s actions in Georgia are also the subject of a grand jury investigation, with the district attorney expected to announcing findings this year.

The select committee said it also plans on Tuesday to untangle the elaborate ""fake electors"" scheme that was aimed at halting Biden's election win. The plan saw fake electors in seven battlegrounds - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico - sign certificates falsely stating that Trump, not Biden, had won their states.

Tuesday’s hearing will be the fourth by the panel this month. The first hearing included a video deposition by Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who said she accepted then-Attorney General Bill Barr's statement that the Justice Department found no fraud sufficient to overturn the election. The former President responded to his daughter’s comments and said, ""Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results. She had long since checked out and was, in my opinion, only trying to be respectful to Bill Barr and his position as Attorney General (he sucked!)."" The committee’s second hearing included testimony from Barr in which he claimed Trump became increasingly “detached from reality” following the election.

The third hearing, held last week, involved testimonies from aides to former Vice President Mike Pence, who said that Trump pressured Pence to overturn his 2020 election defeat despite being told repeatedly it was illegal to do so.

The hearing featured several clips of some of the thousands of Trump supporters who descended on the Capitol after a rally in which Trump repeatedly criticized Pence, chanting for Pence to be pulled out of the building or hanged.

One former White House assistant testified that Trump had called Pence a “wimp” during a heated conversation on January 6.",Q2

The United Arab Emirates on Monday banned the upcoming Pixar animated feature “Lightyear"" from showing in movie theaters after its inclusion of a kiss between two lesbian characters.

The decision by the UAE comes as Malaysia also reportedly will ban the film, raising the possibility other Muslim-majority nations could follow suit on one of Disney's biggest animated films of the year as the film industry comes out of the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Emirates, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, announced through its Media Regulatory Office of the country's Ministry of Youth and Culture that the film would not be opening in the country this Thursday.

The film “is not licensed for public screening in all cinemas in the UAE, due to its violation of the country’s media content standards,” the office said in a tweet. “The office confirms that all films screened in cinemas across the country are subject to follow-up and evaluation before the date of screening to the public, to ensure the safety of the circulated content according to the appropriate age classification.”

The office did not elaborate on the tweet and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The tweet included an image of the film's poster, with the profile image of its main character Buzz Lightyear with a “no” symbol over it in red.

Movie theaters in the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, had already advertised showtimes for the film. But over the weekend, a social media campaign with the Arabic hashtag “Ban Showing Lightyear in the Emirates,” caught the attention of conservative Emiratis. They described showing a lesbian couple on screen as being against their culture and religion.

The movie, with actor Chris Evans voicing the inspiration for the Buzz Lightyear action figure from the “Toy Story” films, includes a female character voiced by actress Uzo Aduba kissing her female partner.

The UAE, many other countries in the wider Mideast, is a Muslim-led nation that criminalizes same-sex relationships. The U.S. State Department warns that Islamic, or Shariah, law in the UAE can include the death penalty for same-sex conduct, while Dubai can levy a 10-year prison sentence and Abu Dhabi allows for up to 14 years.

However, such prosecutions are rarely reported and LGBTQ individuals do live in the skyscraper-studded city-state of Dubai, home to the long-haul carrier Emirates.

The $200 million “Lightyear” is expected to be a major draw for Disney, with analysts estimating it could gross over $100 million in its first weekend.

Studios have allowed censors to cut films in global distribution for content in the past, including in the Mideast market. Recently, Disney has faced protests from activists and its own staff over what they described as CEO Bob Chapek’s slow response in publicly criticizing Florida legislation that opponents dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in late March signed the bill, which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.

The moment had been earlier cut from the film but was restored after Pixar employees protested Disney's response to Florida’s bill.

The movie also may be banned in Malaysia as well. The Star, the country’s top English-language newspaper, cited an anonymous, nongovernment source as saying that Lightyear will not be shown in Malaysian cinemas. No reasons were given. A newspaper in the Persian Gulf island kingdom of Bahrain similarly has speculated the film wouldn't be shown there.

Officials from Malaysia's Film Censorship Board and the Home Affairs Ministry, as well as The Walt Disney Co., could not be immediately reached for comment.",Q2

Ron DeSantis signs Mississippi-style abortion ban into law,"Gov. Ron DeSantis has publicly signed into law a 15-week abortion ban that shortens by more than two months the current window available to legally terminate a pregnancy.

Within minutes of his office announcing that he had received the bill (HB 5), approved by the Legislature in March, DeSantis held a bill signing ceremony and rally at an evangelical church in Kissimmee.

The new law, which goes into effect July 1, significantly reduces access to late-term abortions in the southeast — North Carolina will become the only southern state to permit an abortion after 15 weeks.

Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate had defeated amendments that would have made exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking and mental health. The only exceptions allowed are cases where the mother is at risk of death, ""irreversible physical impairment"" or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.

""We're here today to defend those who can't defend themselves,"" DeSantis said.

""Fifteen weeks is a time where these babies have beating hearts. They can move. They can taste. They can see. They can feel pain. They can suck. And they have brain waves,"" DeSantis said at Nacion de Fe, - Nation of Faith.

Earlier this month, the church organized a protest over ""pornography"" in public schools and against the teaching of critical race theory at a meeting of the Osceola County School Board.

24-hour waiting period:After 7 year legal battle, Leon County judge signs off on Florida abortion waiting period

What changed in abortion law? Which abortions will be legal and illegal in Florida after Gov. DeSantis signs the new bill?

If a physician violates provisions of the abortion ban, they would be guilty of a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

Flanked by Senate President Wilton Simpson, House Speaker Chris Sprowls, and a bevy of lawmakers, DeSantis said the measure provides ""the most significant protections for life"" in a generation.

Sprowls defended the limited exceptions in the new law with a declaration that ""Every child has a right to life,"" and excited the crowd to cheers and applause when he said they were ""blessed to be Floridians,"" because DeSantis is ""the most pro-life governor in America.""

Rep. Allison Tant, D-Tallahassee denounced the new law as government interfence into the personal lives of Floridians.

""That should have no place in our state,"" said Tant while DeSantis and Republican legislative leaders rallied with the bill's supporters.

""Family planning and women's health should not be dictated by politicians,"" said Tant.

Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, a candidate for governor, called out Republican leaders ""hypocrisy"" for bragging about ""the free state of Florida,"" while pushing a law"" to force women and girls to give birth.

""This law is a direct attack on women’s constitutional rights, and it’s cruel, extreme, and inhumane,” said Fried.

Sen. Annette Taddeo, D-Miami, also a candidate for governor said DeSantis' actions made Floridians less free.

""The conservative values of freedom and limited government that the Governor claims to fight for, have gone right out the window when it comes to a woman’s choice about her own body,"" said Taddeo.

And Congressman Charlie Crist, who leads the race for the Democratic nomination to challenge DeSantis in November, said if elected, "" ... I would veto this bill and any attempt to restrict a woman’s right to choose.”

The legislation imposes Florida's most restrictive abortion regulations since the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision established abortion as a constitutional right.

Abortion rights advocates said they will challenge the new law in court.

“If these politicians think the fight against this abortion ban is over they are sadly mistaken. We won’t rest until our rights are restored. No one has the right to control what we can and cannot do with our own bodies,"" said Stephanie Fraim, President and CEO, Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida.

Florida constitution privacy provision complicates in-state abortion restrictions

Until now, a privacy provision in the Florida Constitution that guarantees a right to be let alone by the government has blocked abortion restrictions.

But the provision is grounded in a constitutional right to an abortion established by the Roe v. Wade decision that women rights group fear the U.S. Supreme Court will undermine or overturn this summer.

Hits and misses:Election-year session produces fiery legislation for Floridians

Reproductive rights:If Roe v. Wade is overruled, here's how access to abortion could be affected in your state

The Florida law mirrors a Mississippi law at the heart of the case before the nation's high court.

Abortion law scholar Mary Ziegler has told the USA TODAY Network-Florida that the justices went looking for an opportunity to reopen Roe.

There is no split in lower court decisions or conflict in state statutes for the justices to resolve in the case, said Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor.

DeSantis signed the law closing access to an abortion at 15 weeks, two days after a judge allowed a 24-hour waiting period on the procedure to go into effect. Abortion rights advocates had spent seven years on an attempt to block that waiting period.

https://www.geo.tv/latest/410125-updating,Elon Musk's arrival stirs fears among some Twitter employees,"Elon Musk talks at the Automotive World News Congress at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, January 13, 2015. — Reuters

Concerns center around Twitter's ability to moderate content

Fear Musk's views on moderation may allow trolling to flourish

Twitter management, employees make daily decisions: spokesperson.

News of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk taking a board seat at Twitter has some Twitter employees panicking over the future of the social media firm's ability to moderate content, company insiders told Reuters.

Within hours of the surprise disclosure this week that Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" acquired enough shares to become the top Twitter shareholder, political conservatives began flooding social media with calls for the return of Donald Trump. The former US president was banned from Facebook and Twitter after the January 6 Capitol riot over concerns around incitement of violence.

""Now that @ElonMusk is Twitter's largest shareholder, it's time to lift the political censorship. Oh… and BRING BACK TRUMP!,"" tweeted Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert on Monday.

Despite Twitter's reiteration this week that the board does not make policy decisions, four Twitter employees who spoke with Reuters said they were concerned about Musk's ability to influence the company's policies on abusive users and harmful content.

With Musk on the board, the employees said his views on moderation could weaken years-long efforts to make Twitter a place of healthy discourse and might allow trolling and mob attacks to flourish.

In the wake of Trump's ban from Facebook and Twitter, the billionaire tweeted that many people would be unhappy with U.S. tech companies acting ""as the de facto arbiter of free speech.""

Musk's intentions

Musk has not articulated what he wants to do as a new board member but he has telegraphed his intentions with his Twitter activity. A week before Musk disclosed a 9.1% stake in Twitter, he polled his 80 million followers on whether the site adhered to the principle of free speech and the majority voted 'no.'



The employees, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, point to Musk's history of using Twitter to attack critics. In 2018, Musk came under fire for accusing a British diver who had helped rescue children trapped in a cave in Thailand of being a paedophile.

Musk won a defamation case brought by the diver in 2019.

When asked for comment, a Twitter spokesperson repeated a statement from Tuesday that the board ""plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service,"" but daily operations and decisions are made by Twitter's management and employees.

""Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules,"" the spokesperson said.

Some employees that Reuters spoke to were not so sure about the company's commitment to this.

""I find it hard to believe (the board) doesn't have influence,"" said one employee. ""If that's the case, why would Elon want a board seat?""

But other employees Reuters spoke to said that Musk's involvement could help quicken the pace of new features and product launches, and provide a fresh perspective as an active user of Twitter.

Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to requests for comment.

Twitter's board figures prominently in discussions within Twitter, more so than at other tech companies, one employee said. That is because unlike Meta Platforms Inc, where founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls the company through a dual-class share structure, Twitter only has a single class of shares, making it more vulnerable to activists like Musk. Teams within Twitter often consider how to communicate a strategy or decision to the board, for instance, the employee said.

On Thursday, Musk tweeted an image from 2018 of him smoking weed on the Joe Rogan podcast on Spotify, with the text: ""Twitter's next board meeting is going to be lit.""

Trump's return?

One employee familiar with the company's operations said there were no current plans to reinstate Trump. A Twitter spokesperson said there were no plans to reverse any policy decisions.



But a veteran auto analyst who covers Musk's operating style at Tesla said such a decision may only be a matter of time.

""If Donald Trump was actually rich, he would have liked to have done the same thing but he couldn't afford it. So Elon is doing what Trump would have liked to have done,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.

""I wouldn't be surprised"" if Twitter restores Trump's account now that Elon owns nearly 10% of the company,"" he said.

Longer-term, employees said Musk's involvement may change Twitter's corporate culture, which they say currently values inclusivity. Musk has faced widespread criticism for posting memes that mocked transgender people and efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, and for comparing some world leaders to Hitler.

Several employees were alarmed by the warm welcome Musk received from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and co-founder Jack Dorsey, which prompted them to hit the job market this week.

""Some people are dusting off their resumes,"" one person said. ""I don’t want to work for somebody (like Musk).""",Q2

Lawrence Gaines, 54, who was convicted in 2013 of killing William Thompson of Easton during a fight over drugs, had been granted the opportunity for a new trial by the United States District Court after raising an ineffective counsel claim.

Gaines contended his attorney should have objected when the judge failed to instruct the jury that it should not infer Gaines’ guilt because he did not testify. The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Gaines’ claim, and granted relief in March 2021. Gaines’ retrial was scheduled for this year.

Prosecutors appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where Northampton County Assistant District Attorney Katharine Kurnas pointed out that Gaines’ attorney had indeed requested the court make the no-adverse-inference instruction to the jury. When the judge failed to do so, the attorney made a tactical decision not to object because he didn’t want to draw undue attention to the fact that Gaines didn’t testify.

The circuit court agreed, ruling May 12 that Gaines was not deprived of his right to effective counsel.

In a news release Thursday, District Attorney Terry Houck commended Kurnas and the other prosecutor involved in fighting the district court ruling, Rebecca Kulik, as well as prosecutor Alec Colquhoun, who would have been involved in the retrial.

“The jury rightfully found Lawrence Gaines guilty of first degree murder nine years ago, and now there will be no need for witnesses and friends and family of the victim to relive this tragic event,” Houck said.",Q2

The Western statements about Russia blocking foreign ships in the Black and Azov seas are unfounded, as Moscow opens humanitarian corridors every day, but the Ukrainian authorities refuse to cooperate, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Saturday.



""As for the statements made the day before by official representatives of foreign states about the 'blocking' by the Russian military of foreign vessels in the waters of the Black and Azov seas, they are not consistent with reality. The port in Mariupol has resumed work after the military of Russia and the DPR gained control over it, so the navigating channel was unblocked, and the conditions were created for the ships to leave,"" Zakharova said.



According to the spokesperson, the Russian armed forces open two maritime humanitarian corridors daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Moscow time (05:00 to 16:00 GMT), but the Ukrainian authorities ""refuse to interact with representatives of foreign states and shipowner companies to ensure the safe exit of the blocked ships, practically holding the crews hostage.""



On Thursday, the head of the Russian National Defence Control Center, Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, said that foreign shipowners had ignored opportunities provided by Russia to safely withdraw their vessels from the port of Mariupol, and called on the diplomatic missions of Bulgaria, the Dominican Republic, Liberia, Panama, Turkey, Jamaica and the International Maritime Organization to influence the shipowners.



According to the defence official, the danger of mines in the waters of the Mariupol port has been eliminated and the harbour can be safely used by civilian ships, and a 139 nautical miles long and 3 miles wide naval humanitarian corridor from other Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea will be open daily starting 27 May, with the Ukrainian side being responsible for ensuring the safety of ships leaving the ports.



On Tuesday, the Russian Defence Ministry said that the minesweepers finished clearing the Mariupol port of mines and freed the routes from sunken ships and other navigational hazards. Works to recover port infrastructure are currently underway. On Wednesday, Zakharova said that five foreign vessels were able to leave after the demining.",Q2

KILGORE, Texas — A third person has been charged with hitting and setting a Kilgore woman, who has been missing since 2016, on fire causing the deaths of her and her unborn child, recent court documents show.

Edward Brager, 23, of Troup, was indicted on June 9 on a capital murder charge in connection with the disappearance and death of Sheriya Grant, 20, who was eight months pregnant in 2016.

Allen Lamont Sutton Jr., 33, of Kilgore, and Laneshia Lashae Young, 29, were indicted in December on the same charge.

Grant's body has never been found.

Sutton, the father of Grant's unborn child, and Young have been arrested and sentenced to prison after being found guilty of tampering with evidence.

Indictments for Brager, Sutton and Young all allege that they intentionally and knowingly caused Grant’s death by striking her with a blunt object and setting Grant on fire with accelerant and at the same they caused the death of Grant’s unborn child.

The indictments also state Brager, Sutton and Young could have struck Grant, set her on fire all while trying to kidnap Grant or while trying to commit arson upon Grant.

In Rusk County, Sutton was sentenced to 10 years in prison on April 17, 2019, for tampering with physical evidence related to the killing of Grant in connection with the concealment of a trunk liner missing from a car he shared with Young.

Chief Justice Josh Morriss III of the 6th Court of Appeals in Texarkana later upheld Sutton's 10-year sentence. The ruling said with the presented evidence a jury could find Sutton removed and concealed a trunk liner, or cooperated with Young in such actions, to keep it out of any investigation into Grant’s disappearance.

The appellate court’s ruling goes into a detailed description of Sutton’s relationship with Young and souring relationship with Grant, including that, while Young was serving jail time, Sutton lived with and impregnated Grant, her cousin.

Morriss wrote that Ashley Odom, who lived with her boyfriend, Sutton and Grant at the time, testified Grant told a friend she loved Sutton, who “seized the phone, choked Grant and told her he would kill her.” Young also assaulted Grant in Sutton’s presence three months before she disappeared, Odom testified.

Sutton and Young jointly owned a car that was repossessed after Grant disappeared, the ruling said. The creditor noticed the car was missing a trunk liner, spare tire and jack, with traces of Grant’s blood found on the underside of the trunk’s lid.

The ruling said blood was found on the wiring from the trunk into the trunk’s lid, but that the blood was not tested. Morriss said in the ruling the wiring looked like a person was “trying to escape the trunk.”

Sutton is also awaiting trial out of Gregg County for a solicitation of capital murder charge, which he entered a not guilty plea in 2019. A Gregg County grand jury indictment states Sutton on or about Aug. 1, 2016, attempted to “induce” Nicholas Williams to murder Grant.",Q2

TOMS RIVER, NJ — A Manchester Township man has been charged with attempted murder and bias intimidation in a string of attacks in Lakewood and Jackson on Friday that left three Orthodox Jewish men hospitalized, authorities announced Saturday.

Two of the three men were in critical condition, authorities said. One man was stabbed, and two were hit by a car, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer and Lakewood Police Chief Gregory Meyer said. The prosecutor's office on Sunday confirmed the three victims were Orthodox Jewish men.

Billhimer and Meyer said the investigation, which included assistance from the FBI and the New Jersey Department of Homeland Security, tied all three attacks to Dion Marsh, 27, of Manchester, who was arrested Friday night at his home. Marsh is charged with three counts of attempted murder, three counts of bias intimidation,carjacking, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a weapon, authorities said. He is being held in the Ocean County Jail in Toms River pending a detention hearing.

The prosecutor's office did not give details on the basis for the bias intimidation charges. The Anti-Defamation League and Gov. Phil Murphy released statements Saturday evening, praising law enforcement for the quick arrest and decrying the attacks.

""The safety of our communities, and notably our communities of faith, is not only a paramount concern but among my highest priorities,"" Murphy said. ""We will continue to partner with all who share this commitment so no resident ever needs to live in fear."" ""I am personally horrified at the cruelty with which the suspect allegedly conducted himself,"" said Scott Richman, ADL NY/NJ regional director. ""More needs to be done proactively to prevent violence against the Jewish community, and in particular visibly identifiable Jews in Ocean County and across our region.""

""Jews should not be afraid to freely go about their business without living in fear that they will be targeted for violence,"" Richman said. ""The past few years have seen far too many assaults against Jews."" The string of incidents began with a carjacking about 1 p.m. at Martin Luther King Drive and Pine Street in Lakewood, Billhimer said. Marsh is accused of approaching a 2016 Toyota Camry, assaulting the driver and taking off in the car, Billhimer said.

Five hours later, about 6 p.m., a pedestrian was hit by a dark-colored vehicle in the area of Central Avenue and Carlton Avenue, Billhimer said.

https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2022-05-04/the-supreme-court-abortion-leak-fuels-debate-among-floridas-lawmakers,The Supreme Court abortion leak fuels debate among Florida's lawmakers,"A leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion decision ignited a sense of urgency Tuesday among Florida Democrats while drawing praise from Republicans.

Authored by Justice Samuel Alito, Jr. and supported by other members of the conservative majority of the Supreme Court, the draft opinion was reported Monday night by Politico. Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday confirmed that the leaked document was authentic.

The 98-page draft, if it comes to fruition, would rescind the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and allow states to make their own decisions on abortion. However, a news release that accompanied Roberts’ statement Tuesday said the draft “does not represent a decision by the court or the final position” of any of its members.

The draft was made public just shy of two months before a new Florida law will go into effect prohibiting most abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy. Gov. Ron DeSantis last month signed the measure, which will take effect July 1. Roe v. Wade generally has allowed women to have abortions until about 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Responding to the U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion Tuesday, DeSantis touted the new state abortion law as “the strongest that Florida has seen in decades” and said the state is prepared to defend it from lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.

“We think we’re going to win there, but that is going to be something that we have to do. At the end of the day, it’s a mistake to read the federal Constitution to completely prohibit any pro-life protections. That’s not consistent with the text history structure. I don’t know if that (Supreme Court) opinion is going to be the actual opinion, Roberts said that’s not going to be … final, so who knows what’s going on behind the scenes,” DeSantis said during a news conference in Fort Myers Beach.

But state House Speaker Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor, gave a more emphatic endorsement of the draft opinion.

“I have long believed Roe v. Wade represents an abuse of power to manufacture law by judicial fiat. I eagerly await the official & final opinion issued by the Court. The leak however, is a stunning breach of trust & lack of honor by the individual responsible,” Sprowls wrote in a tweet.

Meanwhile, Democrats braced for what they called a “raid on women’s rights” and quickly organized protests across the state.

“We are walking into a post-Roe world. This is the reality that exists for my daughter that never existed for me. It is a very dangerous world that we are living in,” state Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book, D-Plantation, said.

Book told The News Service of Florida that Democrats, who are heavily outnumbered in the Legislature, will need voters to rally in support of candidates during the November elections to combat further restrictions to abortion access.

“People need to go and vote. We need the numbers. The reality is, and I’ve gotten a lot of questions today about … will the governor add a further restriction on abortion in a special (legislative) session. We know that the governor can do anything he wants, and the Republican-driven Legislature will follow suit and do whatever it is he is asking for,” Book said.

DeSantis has called a special session starting May 23 to address the state’s beleaguered property-insurance system.

Rep. Kelly Skidmore, D-Boca Raton, decried the potential Supreme Court ruling’s effect on other Republican-led states that have abortion laws that would be triggered by a decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

“Immediately, about 25 states will ban abortion, they have trigger laws in place. So, within days, within hours of the Supreme Court ruling, abortion will be banned in nearly half the United States of America,” Skidmore said.

Promising that “the fight is just beginning,” Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democrat running for governor this year, held a rally in Miami to try to energize potential voters. U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, another Democrat running for governor, said in a statement that the issue will be “front and center” in the gubernatorial race.

The Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates advertised a rally to be held Tuesday afternoon outside the Florida Supreme Court.

“We are devastated, we are furious, and we will fight back. This draft opinion is outrageous, and unprecedented, but it is not final. Abortion is still legal in Florida. As of today, it remains your constitutional right,” Stephanie Fraim, president of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida said in a statement.

But groups that oppose abortion cheered the potential decision.

“The state has a compelling interest in protecting human life that is vulnerable, especially at that age. This is a huge day for those of us who have worked almost all of our lives to see this moment happen,” John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, said.

DeSantis, who went to law school at Harvard, focused much of his remarks Tuesday on the leaking of the draft opinion, characterizing it as an act of political intimidation. The draft is part of a case about a Mississippi law, similar to the new Florida law, that would prevent abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

“To have that leak out the way it did was really unprecedented. I think it was really an attack on a lot of the justices. I think it was an intentional thing to try to whip up a lot of the public and to try to make it very political,” DeSantis said.

Roberts called the leak a “singular and egregious breach” of trust that the court has with employees to keep such internal communications confidential.

“To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed. The work of the court will not be affected in any way,” Roberts said in a statement.

They reached Lansing on June 15 after traveling through Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Darla Banks, daughter of the late Native American activist Dennis Banks, walks for her father’s spirit and her late daughter Rose Downwind. Walkers are focused on missing and murdered Indigenous women.

Authorities located Downwind, 31, on Oct. 20, 2015, in Bemidji, Minnesota 52 days after she was reported missing, according to Indian Country Today archives.

Banks is Ojibwe and a member of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.

“My dad had added domestic violence to the walk because my daughter, she was missing and was found murdered,” Banks said.

Dennis Banks co-founded the American Indian Movement in 1968 with Russell Means, Eddie Benton-Banai and Clyde Bellecourt. They started it to address systemic poverty, police brutality and discrimination in their communities.

Dennis Banks, Bellecourt and Benton-Banai were Ojibwe. Means was Oglala Lakota. Bellecourt was the last of the founding members to die on Jan. 11 of this year.

This is Darla Banks’ first walk without her father, who died in 2017.

Alicia Roberts, a Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma citizen, is participating in her first Longest Walk. She said she's in recovery and the walk is a healing movement for her. .

”Me and my family decided to finish my dad’s walk,” Banks said. “We can’t start or do another walk until we finish. This staff needs to go to Washington (D.C.).”

Why are they walking?

Dawne DuShane walks to heal herself.

She celebrated six years sober April 24.

""I'm able to use this experience as a new way of looking at life because it was Dennis Banks who introduced this cultural approach to recovery,"" she said.

DuShane is a member of Cherokee Nation. She started a sobriety group in Oklahoma to heal tribal members.

She walked in 2016 from Tulsa, Oklahoma, with Muscogee (Creek) Nation to Washington, D.C. They detoured to Standing Rock Indian Reservation that August to join the Dakota Access Pipeline protest.

DuShane said she later escaped domestic violence and had back surgery. She didn't think she could walk again.

""It really means a lot to me to be able to walk, put these miles in and be able to meet everyone and see their struggles,"" DuShane said. ""Somehow, it inadvertently gives me the strength to endure my struggle a little bit more.""

Citizens of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe joined the walkers as they came down from the Upper Peninsula. That added the issue of boarding schools, where 225 children in Mount Pleasant attended but never made it home, saidFrank Cloutier, director of public relations for the tribe, in October.

Sky Bonilla, who's a tribal citizen and lives on the Isabella Reservation, joined the walk for his family. He called for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to step in and address domestic abuse on reservations. His niece has been missing for 11 years and Bonilla fights for her return.

""The BIA really needs to step in and discuss what's going on in reservations with federal law and protection of our Native women,"" he said. ""Men come to reservations because they feel like they can get away with raping and killing our women, and then we have MMIW. It's why I wear red.""

Bedahbin Webkamigad, of the Odawa tribe, did the first national walkin 1978, protesting threats to tribal land and water rights. This walk, she said, is just as important as many push for the return of missing women.

Dushane said she has confidence the walkers will make it to Washington, D.C., because of the family that develops over the miles. She recalled Dennis Banks telling walkers they need to be a family to finish.

""We're gonna make it,"" DuShane said. ""I think it's gonna be a great historical change, something that will help our people in the nations that we represent.""

They’ll leave Michigan for Ohio, shortly. They follow a planned route, but DuShane said they ultimately let Creator guide them.

Detectives with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department have confirmed the death was domestic incident-related and domestic violence awareness advocates said they hope the case sends a simple message to anyone involved in an unhealthy relationship.

IMPD was called just after midnight Friday to the parking lot outside Tilly’s Pub where emergency crews found a 26-year-old man dead underneath a car.

The man, later identified as Andre Smith, leaves behind a young child and a grieving family.

Family approved picture of Andre Smith

Court records show that the suspect, 26-year-old Gaylyn Morris, told witnesses she believed Smith was cheating on her with another woman and tracked him to the pub using GPS. Once there, she allegedly ran over him three times in the parking lot before being arrested for murder.

“We don’t want to continue to be on the news talking about death when it could have been prevented,” said Danyette Smith.

Smith, the director of Indianapolis’ domestic violence prevention program, said while domestic violence calls to IMPD over the first few months of 2022 have gone down compared to the end of 2021, there has been one noticeable increase.

“I am noticing there are more calls coming to IMPD from males in reference to females being the suspects,” Smith said. “We want people to know that domestic violence doesn’t discriminate.”

IMPD said there were several witnesses to the disturbance overnight, and while Andre Smith’s family didn’t want to talk about the death on camera, Smith said she wants to remind everyone that resources and advocates are available to help prevent domestic violence before it turns deadly.

“When we see cases like this case, we hope to spread the message of getting resources and when there is domestic violence in a relationship to reach out for help,” said Smith.

It will ultimately be up to the prosecutor’s office to file formal charges against Morris. In the meantime, she is being held at the Marion County Jail without bond.",Q2
https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/354465,"How do you choose a Rabbi? Remembering HaRav Avraham Shapira zt""l","For people the world over, these are often painful and challenging times, filled with wars, mega-epidemics, hometown violence, economic instability, and the like. In Israel as well, the ongoing battle against Arab terror afflicts Jewish communities with feelings of apprehension and uneasiness. That is why when a happy event occurs, a birth, bar mitzvah, an engagement, or a wedding, an added simcha can also be felt, as if to counterbalance the anguish the nation experiences each time a terror victim is laid to rest.

I was thus especially pleased to receive an invitation to the upcoming bar mitzvah of the youth Elkana Dov Sylvetsky, great grandson of the late Chief Rabbi of Israel, HaRav Avraham Elkana Shapira, may his memory be for a blessing, who also served for 25 years as the Rosh Yeshiva of Mercaz HaRav in Jerusalem after the death of HaRav Tzvi Yehuda Kook. The invitation came from the boy’s grandmother Rochel Sylvetsky, Consulting and Op-ed Editor of the Israel National News website whose son, Rabbi Avraham Yisrael (ben Dov) Sylvetsky, is married to the daughter of Rabbi Yaakov Shapira, son of the late Chief Rabbi and today’s Rosh Yeshiva at Mercaz HaRav.

The Mishna of “Avot,” commonly known as the “Ethics of the Fathers, teaches that every Jew should find himself a Rabbi. This injunction should be self-evident. In order to properly follow the Torah, a person needs personal guidance, in spiritual and ethical matters, and in matters of Jewish Law. To underscore the vital role that a Rabbi plays in the life of a Jew, the Hasidic Master, Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, stated that a Jew who doesn’t have a Rabbi resembles a monkey trying to act like a human being.

The question naturally follows: how do you choose a Rabbi? After all, there are many Rabbis to choose from. How can a person know which Rabbi is right for him or for her? Once again, our Sages offer their advice to help expedite our search: “If the Rabbi resembles an angel of the L-rd, then seek Torah from his lips” (Moed Kattan 17A). This definition perfectly describes the bar-mitzvah boy’s late grandfather, HaRav Avraham Elkana Shapira who died on the first day of Sukkot, fifteen years ago, at the age of 93. His son, Rabbi Yaacov, says that a few days before his father’s death, he presented him with the Arba Minim he had purchased for him. “After examining the Hadasim and Lulav, my father, HaRav, picked up the very large Yemonite Etrog, the kind he preferred, which he had to hold in both hands because of its size. People often said the Yemonite Etrog resembled his big heart, in his great love for all of the Jewish People. Half smiling, half sad, he said that he wasn’t sure he would have the merit of performing the mitzvah that year.”

A seventh generation Jerusalemite, Rabbi Shapira was born in the Old City. Rabbi Haim Steiner, a longtime teacher at Mercaz HaRav, recalls that ‘Reb Avrum’ had a Haredi Yeshiva education at the Tiferet Tzvi and Hebron Yeshivas. Recognized as a prodigy in Torah study, the young Rabbi Shapira formed lasting Torah-learning partnershipz, “hevrutot”, with such outstanding scholars as Rabi Moshe Hevroni, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer, Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveichik, and the Hazon Ish. “Rabbi Moshe Feinstein also recognized his greatness,” Rabbi Steiner relates. “In ‘Igrot Moshe’ (Even HaEzer 24) he deliberates over the words of Rabbi Shapira at length and refers to him as, ‘the brilliant and illustrious Rabbi amongst the Sages of Jerusalem - fit to rule in every aspect of Torah.’""

When Rabbi Shapira was 42, Israel’s Chief Rabbi Herzog appointed him to the High Court of the Jerusalem Chief Rabbinate, and later he served as Av Beit Din in Jerusalem. Forming an intimate friendship with Rabbi Kook’s only son, HaRav Tzvi Yehuda Kook, and marrying into the family, Rabbi Shapira began teaching at the Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva, becoming the Rosh Yeshiva upon the death of HaRav Tzvi Yehuda in 1982.

I first met Reb Avrum, as his students called him, a year later. I was still living in New York, a budding baal tshuva, directing the “Volunteers for Israel - Sarel” emergency recruitment campaign during the War in Lebanon, sending American Jewish volunteers to work for a month in Tzahal warehouses. The founders of the program, Rabbi Yehuda Hazani and Meir Indor, brought me to Israel to see what the volunteers were doing during their time in the country. I arrived at Ben Gurion a few hours before Simchat Torah. In the morning, after davening shachrit at Mercaz HaRav and after few mind-blowing rounds of fervent dancing, Rabbi Hazani and Indor brought me into Reb Avrum’s study for his private Kiddush and introduced me to the smiling Rosh Yeshiva, who was also the newly-elected Chief Rabbi of Israel. I am embarrassed to admit, his small stature, happy gleaming face, sparkling eyes, and pure white beard reminded me of Santa Claus – that’s how far away I was from Judaism!

In answer to Rabbi Hazani’s question if I had to keep two days of Yom Tov since I was planning to make Aliyah later that year, Reb Avrum answered that no, but I shouldn’t travel outside of Jerusalem or publically engage in anything that was forbidden on Yom Tov. All the time he spoke, he focused his happy beaming expression and twinkling eyes directly at me. His smiling angelic appearance overwhelmed me. Though I considered Rabbi Hazani to be my spiritual mentor, when I realized HaRav Shapira was my Rabbi’s Rabbi, he immediately became my chief Rabbi too.

After I moved to Israel, a Haredi newspaper in Jerusalem that was running a campaign against the Chief Rabbinate offered me a job as the editor of an English edition they wanted to start. I asked Rav Avrum if I could accept the position. “You may have reward in This World,” he replied with his almost constant smile. “But you won’t have any reward in the World to Come.”

On another occasion, his combination of Torah scholarship and down-to-earth wisdom startled me completely. I went to him to ask about a screenplay I had written in which a young man from America comes to Israel and is murdered by an Arab terrorist. I told him the plot and said that I was worried that it might fall into the forbidden category of speaking negatively about the Land of Israel, since the murder of the youth in the film might give support to people’s fears about making Aliyah.

“Movies are for the goyim, aren’t they?” he ask.

“Not only for the goyim,” I answered. “Jews watch movies too.”

“Well, if you are worried about discouraging Jews from America, not many of them make Aliyah anyway,” he said. “In addition, I am not a ‘maven’ about movies, but the little I understand is that if you don’t have the murder, you won’t have a movie.”

His eyes twinkled. The answer characterized the dual nature of Reb Avrum – immense Torah wisdom with a down-to-earth simplicity, accompanied by a serious peering expression and a perpetual smile in his eyes.

Another time, before Sukkot, I asked him if I could try the mystical kavanot and yichudim prayers when waving the lulav. In his humble manner, he answered, “I don’t know anything about yichudim. I’m not a Kabbalist.” Later I discovered that he knew every sphere of the Torah, including its secret esoteric teachings.

During the protests against the Israeli Government’s negotiations to surrender the Golan, I made a poster portraying Yitzhak Rabin in a negative fashion, escorting Arafat and Assad into the Old City of Jerusalem. The caption read: “Today the Golan, Tomorrow Jerusalem.” One of the volunteers whom I drafted to paste the poster on billboards throughout the city was a student at Mercaz HaRav. Before setting off with a brush and a pail of paste, he wanted to ask Rabbi Shapira’s permission. I accompanied him to the home of the Rosh Yeshiva. “Would the Chofetz Haim make a poster like this?” the Chief Rabbi asked me. “After all, Yitzhak Rabin is also a son of Avraham Avinu.”

Later, when Arik Sharon decided to give away Gush Katif to Arab terrorists, I interviewed Reb Avrum in a protest film made to rally public opinion against the evacuation. When we asked him if the Torah permitted a Jewish government in Israel to surrender pieces of Eretz Yisrael, he answered sharply, ‘Yesh yetzer l’rah!’ ‘There is an inclination to do evil!’ When we repeated the question, wanting the Chief Rabbi to give a more direct answer about the legality of Sharon’s plan, he repeated his words, ‘Yesh yetzer l’rah!” Once again we asked if a Jewish government in Israel could surrender pieces of Eretz Yisrael, and this time he replied in a loud, irritated voice, ‘Why do they ask me a question that every child in Heder can answer?!’”

Rav Avrum wasn’t only a Rabbi I went to for Halakhic guidance. When each of our six curly-haired boys reached the age of three, my wife and I took them to Rav Avrum for the first-time “Chalakeh” hair-cutting ceremony. “Invite me to the boy’s wedding,” he always said with a happy smile, “and give the curls to his bride.”

Tzvi Fishman HaRav Shapira and my son Bini

I asked his son, Rabbi Yaacov, to share some recollections of his father’s visits to America as Chief Rabbi. “I accompanied my father, HaRav, on all of his trips to meet with Rabbis in America. Once he met with President George Bush in the Oval Office. It was a time of considerable tension between the State Department and Israel. The White House offered to provide a translator, but Abba insisted that we bring our own, wanting to be sure that his words were conveyed exactly. The visit was scheduled to last 15 minutes, but it went on for almost an hour. The President asked many questions about Eretz Yisrael. He seemed amazed to learn that it was no longer a barren desert. Surely he knew, but meeting a holy Rabbi from the Holy Land seemed to trigger a deep emotional response. You could tell by his contented expression that he really enjoyed spending time with my father.

Can you recall some unusual event in America that characterizes your father?

“Once, in Manhattan, we had some free time before the next scheduled appointment. HaRav insisted we go to what he called, ‘the tallest tower.’ He wasn’t supposed to go anywhere without a police escort, but we arranged for someone to drive us to the Empire State Building. At the very top, he walked all around the observation deck, peering through the binoculars, and gazing this way and that, as if he was checking the kashrut of an Etrog. He explained he was trying to see for himself if Manhattan was truly an island surrounded by rivers which could be considered an Eruv for Shabbat.

What do you remember about his meeting with the Rebbe of Chabad?

When we visited 770 with HaRav Mordechai Eliahu, the Lubavitcher Rebbe came out of his study to greet the Chief Rabbis from Israel. When the time came to enter his study for a less public discussion, the three Gedolei HaDor paused before the doorway, each Rabbi insisting that the others go first. Finally it was decided that my father go first since he was holding a Gemara. Also, as a Kohen, the others insisted he had the right of way. During their conversation, the Rebbe asked my father if anything was missing for him in America. He answered, ‘The daily Birkat Kohanim’ which is only recited on holidays in America. But I found a Halabi shul where they do it, so in the morning, I took my father there to daven.’

During their long discussion, the Lubavitcher Rebbe suggested that they draw up a letter demanding that the Mashiach come immediately. HaRav Eliahu noted that the three of them comprised a Beit Din. But my father refused, saying that he lacked the stature to sign on a document like that. When I asked him later about his refusal, he said that the Mashiach should be induced by other means, such as our own work to improve our character traits and to increase our Torah study and our connection to Eretz Yisrael. Wherever he spoke to an audience of American Jews, he emphasized the imperative for all Jews to make Aliyah, citing the Rambam who equates kibbutz galuyot, the Ingathering of the Exiles, with Mashiach.”

Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu zt""l and Rabbi Avraham Shapira zt""l

To me, your father was the epitome of humility, yet he could also be as fierce as a lion, as when he called upon Israeli soldiers to refuse orders to evacuate the Jews of Gush Katif from their homes. How did he combine these two almost contradictory attributes?

“Apparently, the two midot do not necessarily contradict, as we discover in the deeds of our Forefathers. Once, at a large Jewish Day School in New York, when my father entered the crowded auditorium, a young boy stood up and recited the blessing upon seeing a person of profound Torah wisdom, ‘Blessed are You… who has imparted Your wisdom to those who revere You.’ My father hurried forward to the stage and asked who instructed the boy to say such a thing? ‘It is a blessing in vain!’ he declared. Everyone was stunned. Then HaRav Mordechai Eliahu stepped forward and said, ‘If the blessing was said upon seeing me, indeed it is a blessing in vain. But if it was said upon seen HaRav Shapira, then it is absolutely proper.’”

When your father met with Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, do you remember what they spoke about?

“They spoke about everything. Questions of Halakhah flew back and forth between them the way ordinary people talk about their children when they meet. My father was particularly concerned with the lack of one central Rabbinical authority in America, similar to the Chief Rabbinate in Israel. Rabbi Feinstein agreed.

Did Rabbi Shapira meet with Rabbi Yosef Ber Soloveitchik as well?

“Yes. It was arranged that they would both speak at a large Beit Knesset. When they met, my father stepped forward and kissed the surprised Torah scholar. After all, it is forbidden to kiss a creature of flesh and blood in a synagogue, where all of our love is directed exclusively to our Father in Heaven. Sensing everyone’s wonder, my father said, ‘It is forbidden to kiss a person in a Beit Knesset, but it is permitted to kiss a Sefer Torah.’”

Law enforcement officials in Alabama have been looking for Casey White, who was awaiting trial on a capital murder case, and Vicky White, a jail official, since they vanished after leaving the Lauderdale County Detention Center last week. The two are not related, but had a ""special relationship,"" authorities said.

Garland said they should be considered armed and dangerous and that anyone who spots them should not approach them.

""They worked together in designing this plan to escape,"" said U.S. Marshal Marty Keely, whose deputies are leading the hunt.

Casey Cole White, the imposing murder suspect who escaped from an Alabama jail Friday morning with the alleged help of a prison official, warned cops in 2015 that he’d kill his ex-girlfriend if he got the chance, according to court documents. (Lauder Expand

Last Friday, Vicky White, 56, told her coworkers that the 38-year-old inmate needed to go to the courthouse for a mental health evaluation. She was escorting the inmate alone — a violation of the sheriff's office policy. When she did not answer her phone or return in the afternoon, authorities realized the pair had gone missing. Authorities eventually learned that the evaluation was never scheduled and was just a charade to allow Vicky White to sneak Casey White out of the jail without suspicion.

The two left in a patrol car, which was found abandoned nearby in a parking lot where investigators believe Vicky White had parked a getaway car.

In the past week, authorities have learned that Vicky White purchased an array of weapons, including an AR-15 rifle in January and a shotgun two weeks before the escape. They also believe she has a 9 mm handgun with her and have received reports she may also have a .45 caliber handgun, Keely said.

Vicky White, 56, the assistant director of corrections at the facility, bought a 2007 copper Ford Edge SUV before the escape, the sheriff’s office announced Wednesday. The plate number was not available. (Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office)

Federal investigators believe they had been planning the escape for at least several months, Keely said. Vicky White sold her house for $95,000 — nearly half of the market value — and had also sold her car just before the escape, he said. She had also filed paperwork to officially retire from her job.

Police believe Vicky White had staged a getaway car nearby — a 2007 orange Ford Edge — that had no license plates. She bought the car just a few days before the escape and paid for it with cash, Keely said.

""It was well planned,"" Keely said of the escape. ""She has a lot of knowledge about law enforcement procedures.""

The Marshals Service and the sheriff's office have interviewed a slew of associates, family members and others who knew both Casey White and Vicky White and have received numerous tips in the investigation. But despite their best efforts, investigators have not come up with any solid leads to locate them.

""We've vetted out all the leads and so far, we have no legitimate spotting,"" Keely said.

The Marshals Service is offering up to $10,000 reward for information leading to Casey White’s capture and a $5,000 reward for information leading to Vicky White.

Authorities have said Casey White, who stands 6 feet, 9 inches (about 2 meters), should be recognizable by his size.

Casey White was being held at the jail on capital murder charges in the 2015 death of Connie Ridgeway. He confessed to the slaying in 2020 while in state prison for other crimes. He's been linked to home invasions, carjackings and was also involved in a police chase, Keely said.

Family members and colleagues said they are bewildered by the involvement of Vicky White, who had worked for the sheriff’s office for 16 years, with the inmate who was already serving a 75-year prison sentence for attempted murder and other crimes.",Q2

Should law-abiding citizens have the right to own a howitzer?

And if so, should an 18-year-old be able to buy one?

These are questions to be considered as the nation reacts to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and looks at Second Amendment gun rights.

That amendment on the right to bear arms refers to “a well-regulated militia.” A militia is a military organization. So, should that cover all military weapons, not just military-style assault rifles? Could the right to have howitzers be infringed?

We send howitzers to Ukraine. Why there, when there is so much need at home?

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

With all the shootings in this country, with firearms now the leading cause of death of children and adolescents, should more be done to provide stronger firepower for law-abiding citizens to combat this violence?

With calls to harden the defense of schools against evildoers, what would harden the defense more than a howitzer on the roof of every school? They could hit a target 10 miles away.

With so many politicians calling for more guns in the community as the answer to gun violence, would more howitzers in the community be the strongest deterrent?

Did Texas cops wait so long in that hallway — as kids were dying — because they knew they were outgunned by the killer with an assault-style weapon? If so, is the solution to ban those assault weapons of war? Or is it give police more powerful weapons? Howitzers?

Some states like Indiana have done away with need for a permit to carry a gun. If there is a “constitutional carry” provided by the Second Amendment, is there also a “constitutional tow,” a right for law-abiding citizens to tow a howitzer? Would they need a permit? Probably not in Indiana, given the state legislature’s stand against permits.

Since Texas law has worked so well for so long in allowing 18-year-olds to buy rifles, now even ones designed for war, is there any need to keep people that age from buying a howitzer? They, of course, still would not be able to buy a beer.

If howitzers became prevalent on American streets, there would be demands by gun control advocates to ban them. Would the National Rifle Association respond that when howitzers are outlawed, only outlaws will have howitzers?

Would Americans agree that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a howitzer is a good guy with a howitzer?

The Second Amendment language about need for “a well-regulated militia” brings up another possible reason for howitzers.

Militia groups in Michigan and other states practice tactics for civil war to save America. Do they need more powerful weapons to respond to threats such as election of a president they don’t like?

Insurrectionists storming the Capitol weren’t able to stop election certification or hang Mike Pence. Would the outcome have been different if they had howitzers? Could they have taken out Pence? And taken off the dome to make it impossible to meet in the Capitol to certify anything?

While sales of assault weapons now increase, another response to the Texas massacre is criticism of Daniel Defense for selling an assault-style weapon to the 18-year-old killer and pitching advertising toward young buyers.

But the firm stated firmly that “our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and the community devastated by this evil act.” Isn’t that enough?

Instead of making it possible for law-abiding citizens and militia groups to have howitzers, we send them to Ukraine.

Donald Trump offers help. He deplores so much spending to help Ukraine defend against forces of Vladimir Putin. Instead, Trump says, we should attack problems here at home.

So, if we cut off howitzers for Ukraine, could they be used instead for attacking problems here at home?

And then there is the bazooka.

Authorities in Suffolk County, New York, on Tuesday released video evidence from the unsolved Gilgo Beach murders, showing the last known surveillance of Megan Waterman, one of the victims.

Suffolk County Police also announced it is doubling the Crime Stoppers reward to $50,000 for information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the case.

Waterman, whose remains were found along Ocean Parkway, near Gilgo Beach in 2010, was last seen at Holiday Inn Express in Hauppauge, New York, in June 2010. She had advertised escort services on Craigslist.

The remains of 10 people were found in 2010 and 2011 in the weedy sections off Ocean Parkway near Jones Beach. At the time, police said half of the identified victims worked as prostitutes.

Earlier this year, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney K. Harrison created the Gilgo Beach Homicide Investigation Task Force. The task force includes representatives from the F.B.I., New York State Police, the Suffolk County District Attorney's office and the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office.

In 2020, police released photos of a belt believed to be handled by the suspect, which did not belong to any of the victims, hoping to advance the investigation.

Authorities discovered the remains during the search for Shannan Gilbert, a sex worker from New Jersey, but she is not believed to be tied to the other deaths because she did not match the pattern of the Gilgo Beach homicides, police said in 2020.

Remains found on Dec. 11, 2010 during the search for Gilbert, were later identified as the remains of 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy. Two days later, three more victims were found on Ocean Parkway. They were later identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25; Amber Lynn Costello, 27; and Megan Waterman, 22.

All four women worked as Craigslist escorts.

The remains of another woman who worked as an escort were found on March 29, 2011, but the remains have not been identified.

On April 4, 2011, three more sets of remains were found on Ocean Parkway, which were those of a toddler, an unidentified Asian male and a third victim who was later identified as Valerie Mack.

Two more sets of remains were found a week later, one of which was discovered to be the mother of the toddler. The mother's partial remains were first found in 1997.

HAMPTON, Va. — Monday night, the Hampton NAACP chapter protested the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

It's a decision that has sparked anger and outrage across the country. So, the organization is asking people to turn their anger into action.

The group said much of that action comes down to voting.

Michelle McFarland with Repro Rising VA said it’s not just abortion rights that have been stripped away by this decision.

""Your rights have been stripped. They are talking about stripping away privacy,"" she told the crowd of about 50 at Canaan Baptist Church.

State Senator Mamie Locke said there is an expectation that people will eventually stop protesting this and just live with the decision. She said that can’t happen.

""This is not just a moment,"" she said.

One woman spoke about getting Plan B at Planned Parenthood years ago. She said it was either pay $75 then or pay for raising a baby later on.

""We’re talking about our mothers and our sisters and our daughters. We’re talking about the basic womb of life here and how dare six individuals who weren’t even elected determine our options.""

Hampton NAACP President Gaylene Kanoyton said it’s not just about Roe v. Wade, it’s about what could come next.

Justice Clarence Thomas said he wants to overturn other landmark cases that legalized same-sex marriage and contraception.

""This is a domino effect. It’s gonna spill into civil rights, civil liberties, and we want to be proactive and not reactive,"" Kanoyton said.",Q2

Arianne Bennett in her Northwest D.C. apartment. Her husband, Scott Bennett, in the photo at top right, died of COVID-19 in January. He was fully vaccinated and boosted. Washington Post/Matt McClain

WASHINGTON — Unvaccinated people accounted for the overwhelming majority of deaths in the United States throughout much of the coronavirus pandemic. But that has changed in recent months, according to a Washington Post analysis of state and federal data.

The pandemic’s toll is no longer falling almost exclusively on those who chose not to get shots, with vaccine protection waning over time and the elderly and immunocompromised — who are at greatest risk of succumbing to COVID-19, even if vaccinated — having a harder time dodging increasingly contagious strains.

The vaccinated made up 42% of fatalities in January and February during the highly contagious omicron variant’s surge, compared with 23% of the dead in September, the peak of the delta wave, according to nationwide data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed by The Post. The data is based on the date of infection and limited to a sampling of cases in which vaccination status was known.

As a group, the unvaccinated remain far more vulnerable to the worst consequences of infection — and are far more likely to die — than people who are vaccinated, and they are especially more at risk than people who have received a booster shot.

“It’s still absolutely more dangerous to be unvaccinated than vaccinated,” said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California at Irvine who studies COVID-19 mortality. “A pandemic of — and by — the unvaccinated is not correct. People still need to take care in terms of prevention and action if they become symptomatic.”

A key explanation for the rise in deaths among the vaccinated is that COVID-19 fatalities are again concentrated among the elderly.

Nearly two-thirds of the people who died during the omicron surge were 75 and older, according to a Post analysis, compared with a third during the delta wave. Seniors are overwhelmingly immunized, but vaccines are less effective and their potency wanes over time in older age groups.

Experts say they are not surprised that vaccinated seniors are making up a greater share of the dead, even as vaccine holdouts died far more often than the vaccinated during the omicron surge, according to the CDC. As more people are infected with the virus, the more people it will kill, including a greater number who are vaccinated but among the most vulnerable.

The bulk of vaccinated deaths are among people who did not get a booster shot, according to state data provided to The Post. In two of the states, California and Mississippi, three-quarters of the vaccinated senior citizens who died in January and February did not have booster doses. Regulators in recent weeks have authorized second booster doses for people over the age of 50, but administration of first booster doses has stagnated.

Even though the death rates for the vaccinated elderly and immunocompromised are low, their losses numbered in the thousands when cases exploded, leaving behind blindsided families. But experts say the rising number of vaccinated people dying should not cause panic in those who got shots, the vast majority of whom will survive infections. Instead, they say, these deaths serve as a reminder that vaccines are not foolproof and that those in high-risk groups should consider getting boosted and taking extra precautions during surges.

“Vaccines are one of the most important and longest-lasting tools we have to protect ourselves,” said California State Epidemiologist Erica Pan, citing state estimates showing vaccines have shown to be 85% effective in preventing death.

“Unfortunately, that does leave another 15,” she said.

‘He did not expect to be sick’

Arianne Bennett recalled her husband, Scott Bennett, saying, “But I’m vaxxed. But I’m vaxxed,” from the Washington hospital bed where he struggled to fight off COVID-19 this winter.

Friends had a hard time believing Bennett, co-founder of the Washington-based chain Amsterdam Falafelshop, was 70. The adventurous longtime entrepreneur hoped to buy a bar and planned to resume scuba-diving trips and 40-mile bike rides to George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate.

Bennett went to get his booster in early December after returning to Washington from a lodge he owned in the Poconos, where he and his wife hunkered down for fall. Just a few days after his shot, Bennett began experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, meaning he was probably exposed before the extra dose of immunity could kick in. His wife suspects he was infected at a dinner where he and his server were unmasked at times.

A fever-stricken Bennett limped into the hospital alongside his wife, who was also infected, a week before Christmas. He died Jan. 13, among the 125,000 Americans who succumbed to COVID-19 in January and February.

“He was absolutely shocked. He did not expect to be sick. He really thought he was safe,'” Arianne Bennett recalled. “And I’m like, ‘But baby, you’ve got to wear the mask all the time. All the time. Up over your nose.'”

Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida College of Public Health, said the deaths of vaccinated people are among the consequences of a pandemic response that emphasizes individuals protecting themselves.

“When we are not taking this collective effort to curb community spread of the virus, the virus has proven time and time again it’s really good at finding that subset of vulnerable people,” Salemi said.

While experts say even the medically vulnerable should feel assured that a vaccine will probably save their lives, they should remain vigilant for signs of infection. As more therapeutics become available, early detection and treatment are key.

When Wayne Perkey, 84, first started sneezing and feeling other cold symptoms in early February, he resisted his physician daughter’s plea to get tested for the coronavirus.

The legendary former morning radio host in Louisville had been boosted in October. He diligently wore a mask and kept his social engagements to a minimum. It must have been the common cold or allergies, he believed. Even the physician who ordered a chest X-ray and had no coronavirus tests on hand thought so.

Perkey relented, and the test came back positive. He didn’t think he needed to go to the hospital, even as his oxygen levels declined.

“In his last voice conversation with me, he said, ‘I thought I was doing everything right,'” recalled Lady Booth Olson, another daughter, who lives in Virginia. “I believe society is getting complacent, and clearly somebody he was around was carrying the virus. … We’ll never know.”

From his hospital bed, Perkey resumed a familiar role as a high-profile proponent for vaccines and coronavirus precautions. He was familiar to many Kentuckians who grew up hearing his voice on the radio and watched him host the televised annual Crusade for Children fundraiser. He spent much of the pandemic as a caregiver to his ex-wife who struggled with chronic fatigue and other long-haul COVID symptoms.

“It’s the 7th day of my COVID battle, the worst day so far, and my anger boils when I hear deniers talk about banning masks or social distancing,” Perkey wrote on Facebook on Feb. 16, almost exactly one year after he posted about getting his first shot. “I remember times we cared about our neighbors.”

In messages to a family group chat, he struck an optimistic note. “Thanks for all the love and positive energy,” he texted on Feb. 23. “Wear your mask.”

As is often the case for COVID-19 patients, his condition rapidly turned for the worse. His daughter Rebecca Booth, the physician, suspects a previous bout with leukemia made it harder for his immune system to fight off the virus. He died March 6.

“Really and truly his final days were about, ‘This virus is bad news.’ He basically was saying: ‘Get vaccinated. Be careful. But there is no guarantee,'” Rebecca Booth said. “And, ‘If you think this isn’t a really bad virus, look at me.’ And it is.”

Hospitals, particularly in highly vaccinated areas, have also seen a shift from COVID wards filled predominantly with the unvaccinated. Many who end up in the hospital have other conditions that weaken the shield afforded by the vaccine.

Vaccinated people made up slightly less than half the patients in the intensive care units of Kaiser Permanente’s Northern California hospital system in December and January, according to a spokesman.

Gregory Marelich, chair of critical care for the 21 hospitals in that system, said most of the vaccinated and boosted people he saw in ICUs were immunosuppressed, usually after organ transplants or because of medications for diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

“I’ve cared for patients who are vaccinated and immunosuppressed and are in disbelief when they come down with COVID,” Marelich said.

‘There’s life potential in those people’

Jessica Estep, 41, rang a bell celebrating her last treatment for follicular lymphoma in September. The single mother of two teenagers had settled into a new home in Michigan, near the Indiana border. After her first marriage ended, she found love again and got married in a zoo in November.

As an asthmatic cancer survivor, Estep knew she faced a heightened risk from COVID-19, relatives said. She saw only a tight circle of friends and worked in her own office in her electronics repair job. She lived in an area where around 1 in 4 residents are fully vaccinated. She planned to get a booster shot in the winter.

“She was the most nonjudgmental person I know,” said her mother, Vickie Estep. “It was OK with her if people didn’t mask up or get vaccinated. It was OK with her that they exercised their right of choice, but she just wanted them to do that away from her so that she could be safe.”

With Michigan battling back-to-back surges of the delta and omicron variants, Jessica Estep wasn’t able to dodge the virus any longer — she fell ill in mid-December. After surviving a cancer doctors described as incurable, Estep died Jan. 27. Physicians said the coronavirus essentially turned her lungs into concrete, her mother said.

Estep’s 14-year-old daughter now lives with her grandparents. Her widower returned to Indianapolis just months after he moved to Michigan to be with his new wife.

Her family shared her story with a local television station in hopes of inspiring others to get vaccinated, to protect people such as Estep who could not rely on their own vaccination as a foolproof shield. In response to the station’s Facebook post about the story, several commenters shrugged off their pleas and insinuated it was the vaccines rather than COVID causing deaths.

Immunocompromised people and those with other underlying conditions are worth protecting, Vickie Estep said. “There’s life potential in those people.”

A delayed shot

As Arianne Bennett navigates life without her husband, she hopes the lesson people heed from his death is to take advantage of all tools available to mitigate a virus that still finds and kills the vulnerable, including by getting boosters.

Bennett wore a music festival shirt her husband gave her as she walked into a grocery store to get her third shot in March. Her husband urged her to get one when they returned to Washington, but she became sick at the same time he did. She scheduled the appointment for the earliest she could get the shot: 90 days after receiving monoclonal antibodies to treat the disease.

“My booster! Yay!” Bennett exclaimed in her chair as the pharmacist presented an updated vaccine card.

“It’s been challenging, but we got through it,” the pharmacist said, unaware of Scott Bennett’s death.

Tears welled in Bennett’s eyes as the needle went in her left arm, just over a year after she and her husband received their first shots.

“Last time we got it, we took selfies: ‘Look, we had vaccines,'” Bennett said, beginning to sob. “This one leaves me crying, missing him so much.”

The pharmacist leaned over and gave Bennett a hug in her chair.

“He would want you to do this,” the pharmacist said. “You have to know.”

The Washington Post’s Lenny Bernstein contributed to this report.

Methodology

Death rates compare the number of deaths in various groups with an adjustment for the number of people in each group. The death rates listed for the fully vaccinated, the unvaccinated, and those vaccinated with boosters were calculated by the CDC using a sample of deaths from 23 health departments in the country that record vaccine status, including boosters, for deaths related to COVID-19. The CDC study assigns deaths to the month when a patient contracted COVID-19, not the month of death. The latest data published in April reflected deaths of people who contracted COVID as of February. The CDC study of deaths among the vaccinated is online, and the data can be downloaded.

The death rates for fully vaccinated people, unvaccinated people, and fully vaccinated people who received an additional booster are expressed as deaths per 100,000 people. The death rates are also called incidence rates. The CDC estimated the population sizes from census data and vaccination records. The study does not include partially vaccinated people in the deaths or population. CDC adjusted the population sizes for inaccuracies in the vaccination data. The death data is provisional and subject to change. The study sample includes the population eligible for boosters, which was originally 18 and older, and now is 12 and older.

Advertisement:

To compare death rates between groups with different vaccination status, the CDC uses incidence rate ratios. For example, if one group has a rate of 10 deaths per 100,000 people, the death incidence rate would be 10. Another group may have a death incidence rate of 2.5. The ratio between the first group and the second group is the rate of 10 divided by the rate of 2.5, so the incidence rate ratio would be 4 (10 ÷ 2.5 = 4). That means the first group dies at a rate four times that of the second group.

The CDC calculates the death incidence rates and incidence rate ratios by age groups. It also calculates a value for the entire population adjusted for the size of the population in each age group. The Post used those age-adjusted total death incidence rates and incidence rate ratios.

The Post calculated the share of deaths by vaccine status from the sample of death records the CDC used to calculate death incidence rates by vaccine status. As of April, that data included 44,000 deaths of people who contracted COVID in January and February.

The share of deaths for each vaccine status does not include deaths for partially vaccinated people because they are not included in the CDC data.

The Post calculated the share of deaths in each age group from provisional COVID-19 death records that have age details from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. That data assigns deaths by the date of death, not the date on which the person contracted COVID-19. That data does not include any information on vaccine status of the people who died.",Q2
https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/employee-benefits-compensation/1202794/california-legislative-update-what39s-left-to-affect-you,California Legislative Update: What's Left To Affect You?,"Seyfarth Synopsis: Headlining the employment-related bills that passed the May 27, 2022, House of Origin Deadline is AB 85, which extended COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave to September of this year, as well as bills related to accommodations, leaves, retaliation, and workers' compensation.

On the deadline for bill introduction, back in February, California legislators introduced 611 bills between the two houses, bringing the total number of bills introduced in 2022 to 2,020—1,361 Assembly Bills (""AB"") and 659 Senate Bills (""SB"") 458 of those bills were spot bills, while 181 were intent bills (explanation here). A significant portion of the bills introduced occupy the labor and employment space.

While many measures that would have caused headaches for employers failed to meet the House of Origin deadline, the most concerning provisions remain on a path to Governor Newsom's desk. Below, we summarize the most significant bills that met the House of Origin deadline and remain in play for California employers.

The bills will now make their way through the committee process in either the Senate or Assembly (depending on which Chamber introduced the measure). Many of these measures will undergo significant amendment, or be completely gutted and amended to look nothing like their genesis. Some will make it through the legislative process, and some will not. Stay tuned for more in-depth analyses of the proposed bills of most interest to employers as the session continues.

COVID-19 Continues to Occupy Legislative Focus

COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave (Again): AB 84

While the California legislature was unable to, or uninterested in, passing a broad vaccination mandate, intense negotiations between the Newsom administration and the business community yielded a whole new tranche of up to 80-hours of mandatory paid sick leave for a variety of COVID-19-related reasons that went into effect on February 19, 2022, and was made retroactive to cover time off taken after January 1, 2022. Despite lobbying efforts by the business community, employers cannot require that this leave be exhausted before using leave available under the Cal/OSHA ETS.

In this iteration of the SPSL, which we blogged about in detail here, there are two buckets of leave available, each up to 40 hours. For the ""first bucket,"" the qualifying reasons for an employee to be eligible for paid leave are nearly the same as for the 2021 iteration, SB 95, but AB 84 adds leave in order to attend a vaccination appointment for a family member, or to care for a family member experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Unlike the 2021 COVID-19 SPSL law, AB 84 provides that an employer may limit the total vaccination-related leave to 3 days or 24 hours unless the employee provides verification from a health care provider that they or their family member is continuing to experience symptoms related to a COVID-19 vaccine or booster.

Qualifying reasons for the ""second bucket"" of up to 40 hours include where the covered employee or a family member tests positive for COVID-19, and employers are allowed to require proof of the positive test. The employer has no obligation to provide the second bucket of leave if the employee does not have proof of the positive test for themselves or their family member.

The rate of pay required for non-exempt employees is the regular rate during the pay period the leave is taken if the employer uses the workweek method, or alternatively the employer can use a 90-day lookback for determining the average regular rate, that is generally the same as with the normal state paid sick leave law (unless the employer has any flat-sum bonuses involved, in which case the employer will need to use the Alvarado-method of calculating the regular rate, as detailed here). The new law provides for the same pay caps as in previous iterations of supplemental sick leave ($511 per day max). Additional FAQs on this new law are available here.

The 2022 COVID-19 SPSL law sunsets on September 30, 2022.

COVID-19 Workers' Compensation for Critical Workers: AB 1751

This bill extends the current rebuttable presumption (which we previously blogged about here) that specified injuries resulting from COVID-19 were sustained in the course of employment to January 1, 2025. The measure provides that if an employee has paid sick leave benefits specifically available for COVID-19, those benefits must be exhausted before any temporary disability benefits or benefits under the workers' compensation system become due.

This measure applies only to the following employees: (1) Active firefighting members, whether volunteers, partly paid, or fully paid, (2) Peace officers who are primarily engaged in active law enforcement activities, as defined by the Penal Code, and (3) Rescue services coordinators who work for the Office of Emergency Services.

Legislation Regarding Franchises

Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act (or FAST Recovery Act): AB 257

This bill, initially introduced in January of 2021—the first year of the regular session—has been carried over. It has already passed the lower chamber, and is onto the Senate Judiciary Committee for additional consideration. The bill would establish the Fast Food Sector Council, responsible for creating a fast food workers bill of rights, which would address issues related to wages, working conditions, etc. This onerous bill would require franchisors to ensure franchisee compliance with a variety of employment, worker, public health and safety laws, including those related to unfair business practices, general liability, employment discrimination, the California Retail Food Code, a range of labor regulations, and emergency orders.

The bill also would establish joint and several liability for franchisee non-compliance. The bill would nullify any potential work around by prohibiting any waiver or indemnity provisions. Finally, while the bill would, for the most part, be enforced through the DLSE, ominously, it would afford franchisee employees a private right of action for retaliation against franchisors.

Franchise Sales, Renewals, and Discrimination: AB 676

This is a bill intended to fill some ambiguities that arose after the enactment of AB 525 (Holden), which purportedly offered relief to franchisees. This measure would prohibit discrimination against franchisees, in much the same way that FEHA currently prohibits discrimination against employees. Specifically, the bill would prohibit a franchisor from failing or refusing to grant a franchise, or failing or refusing to provide financial assistance, to a franchisee or prospective franchisee that has been granted or provided to other similarly situated franchisees or prospective franchisees based solely on any characteristic of the franchisee or prospective franchisee, or any characteristic of the composition of the neighborhood or geographic area where the franchise is located or the proposed franchise would be located if that characteristic is protected by the Unruh Civil Rights Act. This would confer protected status based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status.

The bill proposes a number of modest reforms, such as clarifying the accounting and payment processes that are applicable when a franchise relationship ends, and clarifying that a franchisee cannot be forced to waive various rights under the law either in a franchise agreement or as a condition of receiving emergency financial assistance. Additionally, the bill provides that the Commissioner of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation may summarily revoke a franchise seller's registration if the Commissioner finds: (a) there has been a failure to comply with any of the provisions of this law; (b) an offer or sale of the franchise would constitute misrepresentation, fraud, or deceit of the purchasers; (c) an applicant has failed to comply with any rule or order of the commissioner; or, (d) any person identified in the application or any officer or director of the franchisor creates an unreasonable risk to the prospective franchisee.

Privacy / Worker Information

Reporting and Publicizing Salaries and Wages: SB 1162

The California Chamber of Commerce has listed this measure as a ""job killer.""

This bill expands upon SB 973 from 2020 (Jackson)—summarized in detail by Seyfarth—which required that employers with 100 or more employees provide the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (""DFEH"") with specified EEO-1 pay data. This measure would expand that requirement to include an employer that has 100 or more employees including those hired through labor contractors.

One of the biggest saving graces to SB 973 for the business community was that the pay data employers were forced to turn over was for the DFEH only, and was not to be made public. Indeed, the measure specifically exempted such data from coverage under the California Public Records Act and considers confidential any individually identifiable information disclosed to the DFEH under these provisions. SB 1162 would make all of that data public.

The bill additionally would require that all employers provide, in a job posting for an open position, the pay scale for that position, and must provide to an employee the pay scale for the position a person is currently employed in, upon request. The measure would permit an aggrieved worker to file a written complaint with the Labor Commissioner within one year after the date the worker learned of the failure to comply with the above requirements and levies a fine of between $100 and $10,000 per violation.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations held a hearing and passed the measure out of committee on May 19, 2022, with amendments to (1) delay publication of DFEH reports by 1 year, (2) exempt businesses with less than 15 employees, and (3) remove Section 3, which required posting all available internal jobs.

Leave / Accommodations / Retaliation

Bereavement Leave: AB 1949

This bill would amend the California Family Rights Act (""CFRA"") to prohibit an employer from denying a request from an employee with at least 30 days of active service to take up to five days of bereavement leave upon the death of a family member, defined as spouse or a child, parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, domestic partner, or parent-in-law. While the days of bereavement leave need not be taken consecutively, the allotted leave must be completed within three months of the date of death of the family member. If the employer does not have a paid bereavement policy, the leave would be unpaid, except that an employee may use vacation, personal leave, accrued and available sick leave, or compensatory time off that is otherwise available to the employee.

The bill also would allow the employer to require documentation of the death of the family member, which can be in the form of a death certificate, a published obituary, or written verification of death, burial, or memorial services from a mortuary, funeral home, burial society, crematorium, religious institution, or governmental agency. The bill would prohibit retaliation for requesting bereavement leave.

Cannabis: AB 2188

The Chamber of Commerce has also labeled this measure a ""job killer."" This bill would amend the FEHA by adding off-the-job cannabis use as one of the characteristics protected by the FEHA, which would greatly expand potential monetary exposure through litigation for California employers.

The bill would not prohibit a company from administering a drug test that detects the active presence of THC in an employee's or prospective employee's bodily fluids only. But, it would prohibit discrimination against an individual for a positive cannabis test, which the bill contends is unrelated to impairment on the job. The bill would also permit an employer to administer a performance-based impairment test, and terminate the employment of an employee who is determined to be impaired by cannabis on the property or premises of the place of employment.

This provision would not apply to employees in building or construction trades, and it would not preempt state or federal laws requiring employees to be tested for controlled substances.

State of Emergency and Emergency Conditions: SB 1044

This bill provides that, in the event of a natural disaster, emergency condition, or state of emergency, an employer may not: (1) take or threaten adverse action against an employee for refusing to report to or leaving a workplace because they feel unsafe; or (2) prevent an employee from accessing their mobile device for use for emergency purposes. While the definition of a State of Emergency is pretty apparent, the existence of an ""emergency condition"" is less clear. The bill defines ""emergency condition"" as either: (1) conditions of disaster or extreme peril to the safety of persons or property at the workplace caused by natural forces or a criminal act; or (2) an order to evacuate a workplace, a worker's home, or the school of a worker's child due to natural disaster or a criminal act.

Recent amendments require the employee to notify the employer of the state of emergency or emergency condition before benefiting from the bill's provisions, and narrow the definition of state of emergency to require that the emergency poses an imminent and ongoing risk of harm to the worker, the worker's home, or the worker's workplace. Regardless, though, the bill would still allow employees to leave work, or refuse to come to work, if the employee subjectively feels unsafe.

Notably, the bill would exclude a health pandemic from a covered state of emergency. It also would exclude from its coverage any employees who are first responders, disaster service workers, healthcare or patient care workers, utility and roadside assistance workers, as well as a number of other categories of essential personnel.

An employer who disciplines an employee for leaving the workplace during an emergency, or prevents any employee from accessing the employee's mobile device, could be subject to a private lawsuit and penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). A recent amendment, however, added a right to cure for employers, in keeping with worker safety concerns.

Labor

Agricultural Labor Relations: AB 2183

This bill entitles a labor organization to access an employer's employee list from the Agricultural Labor Relations Board upon providing written notice to the appropriate regional office of the Board that it intends to organize the agricultural employees of the same employer, accompanied by proof of service of the notice upon the employer. The bill attempts to limit the reach of this provision by providing that an employer need not provide more than one employee list within a 30-day period.

As an alternative procedure to the polling place election process set forth in Section 1156.3 of the Labor Code, the bill would permit a labor organization to be certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit through a representation ballot card election, which permits a bargaining unit to summarily select a labor organization as its representative for collective bargaining purposes without holding a polling place election. The measure sets forth all the various requirements for a labor organization that applies to represent a particular bargaining unit. The Board must certify the labor organization as the exclusive bargaining representative if the board determines that the labor organization has submitted the required number of representation ballot cards and the cards meet specified criteria.

Wage and Hour

Wages, Final Payment: AB 2133

This bill would amend Section 201 of the Labor Code to reduce the amount of time to pay final wages from 72 to 48 hours in the event of a layoff of seasonal employees employed in the curing, canning, or drying of any variety of perishable fruit, fish, or vegetables.

Wage Withholdings: SB 505

This two-year measure has already passed the Senate and is on to the Assembly, but no action has been taken on this measure since June 17, 2021. This bill would provide that, prior to garnishing a public employees' wages when the employer is required or empowered to do so by state or federal law, employers must make a good faith effort to consult with an employee to obtain a written authorization to resolve monetary obligations before employing third-party collection services. Where a written authorization provides for a withholding or diversion of an employee's wages, the bill would prohibit the amount withheld or diverted from exceeding 5% of the employee's monthly gross wages.

Meal and Rest Periods for Public Hospital Employees: SB 1334

This measure would extend to employees of specified public sector employers who provide direct patient care or support direct patient care in a general acute care hospital, clinic, or public health setting the same statutorily required meal and rest break afforded to employees in the private sector. That is, these employees would be statutorily entitled to one unpaid 30-minute meal period on shifts over 5 hours and a second unpaid 30-minute meal period on shifts over 10 hours, as well as one 10-minute paid rest period for every 4 hours worked or major fraction thereof. The same premium pay of one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal or rest period that is not provided would also be required. Workers covered by a CBA would be exempted.

Private employers across California have long dealt with these kinds of claims in the class and PAGA context—be wary public sector employers!

A Slew of Workers' Compensation Bills

Liability Presumptions: SB 1127

This bill has three main thrusts: (1) reducing the time period for an employer to reject liability for an injury from 90 days to 45 days; (2) for certain first responders, increases the penalty to five times the amount of the delayed benefits, but not to exceed $100,000, when liability is unreasonably rejected by an employer; and (3) doubles the duration of temporary disability for cancer presumption claims for those same first responders. The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the rejection of liability is reasonable. As expected, this measure is supported by labor and opposed by the business community.

Requests for Information: AB 399

This bill, or the Medical Provider Network Transparency Act of 2022, as introduced would have solely authorized an employee alleging an on-the-job injury to request the medical provider network name and identification number. The measure underwent a significant gut and amend in the Senate Committee on Labor, Public Employment and Retirement on May 23, 2020.

As amended, for purposes of the workers' compensation system, this bill would provide that if an independent bill review organization—existing law permits a medical provider to request an independent bill review for disputes relating to the amount of payment and authorizes the imposition of fees for this purpose—finds that an employer owes the medical provider, the bill would require the independent bill review organization to bill the employer for the additional review fees. If the employer is found to not owe the medical provider, the bill would require the independent bill review organization to bill the provider for the additional review fees. Employers would be required to pay any additional amounts found owed within 30 days of the final determination.

Disability Payments: AB 2148

The bill would extend until January 1, 2024, a current law that permits employers to commence a program under which disability payments are deposited in a prepaid card account.

Labor Contracting: AB 2614

Would require a ""client employer"" that is subject to Industrial Wage Commission (IWC) Orders Nos. 1 or 7—manufacturing and mercantile industries—to procure independently of any labor contractor, a valid workers' compensation insurance policy for any contracted workers providing labor within its usual course of business. A ""client employer"" is defined as a business entity, regardless of its form, that obtains or is provided workers to perform labor within its usual course of business from a labor contractor. The stated intent of this legislation is to ensure that all contracted workers of labor contractors performing labor within a client employer's usual course of business are covered by a valid workers' compensation insurance policy.

This measure was inspired by a recent string of workers' compensation fraud by operators of staffing agencies (also known as labor contractors) who are providing services to employers. According to the author, ""AB 2614 will close a loophole in state law that allows companies with poor worker safety records to utilize staffing companies to avoid paying the financial costs associated with the companies' safety records.""

Hospital Employees: SB 213

This is a two-year bill that has already passed the Senate and is now being held by the Assembly. The California Chamber of Commerce has tagged this bill as a ""job killer."" This measure would build upon SB 1159, which Seyfarth summarized here, which created two presumptions: one that is specific to frontline workers (peace officers, firefighters, healthcare providers, homecare workers and IHSS workers), and a general presumption for employees who contract COVID-19 in the midst of a workplace outbreak. Of import to SB 213 is the former, which applied to health care workers.

This bill would create rebuttable presumptions within the workers' compensation system that specified infectious diseases such as COVID-19, cancer, musculoskeletal injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, or respiratory disease are occupational injuries for a direct patient care workers employed in an acute care hospital. This presumption would be extended following termination of employment for a period of three months for each full year of employment, not to exceed 60 months. SB 213 also removes the sunset date of the presumption for COVID-19 for direct care workers in an acute care hospital by including the presumption in a different code section.

Miscellaneous Employment Bills

Call Centers: AB 1601

This bill would require an employer of employees in a call center that intends to relocate from this state to notify the Labor Commissioner at least 120 days before the relocation. The bill would authorize the Labor Commissioner to impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for every day that an employer fails to provide this notice. The Labor Commissioner would be required compile a list of employers that provide the requisite notice and employers appearing on the list would be ineligible to be awarded or have renewed state grants or state-guaranteed loans for 5 years after the date that the list is published, and those companies would be ineligible to claim tax credits for 5 taxable years beginning on and after the date that the list is published. Private entities that have contracted with the state for call center services as of January 1, 2023, must ensure that a certain percentage of services are performed in California.

Background Checks: SB 1262

This bill was inspired by the California Court of Appeal decision in All of Us or None of Us. v. Hamrick, which held that an individual's date of birth and driver's license number could not be used as data identifying a criminal defendant in public records. This caused courts around the state to redact birth dates and driver's license numbers from their indexes, making routine background checks much more difficult. This bill would require publicly accessible electronic indexes of defendants in criminal cases to permit searches and filtering of results based on a defendant's driver's license number or date of birth.

Extending Statute of Limitations: AB 2777

The concerning measure would amend the Code of Civil Procedure to permit a putative plaintiff, from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, to press a cause of action in court based on sexual assault or ""other inappropriate conduct,"" regardless of whether that claim would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations, so long as the actions occurred on or after January 1, 2009. Essentially, this would mean that a putative plaintiff may bring one of a number of vaguely-defined claims, regardless of how stale those claims are, from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. This is despite the fact that AB 1619 (Berman – 2018), already provides for a lengthy ten-year statute of limitations for claims relating to a sexual assault.

Moreover, claims that would be brought under this bill can be ""revived"" during the free for all period include all claims seeking more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in damages ""arising out of a sexual assault or other inappropriate contact, communication, or activity of a sexual nature that would otherwise be barred before January 1, 2023,"" but the statute does not endeavor to define what constitutes ""activity of a sexual nature.""

An aggrieved employee or former employee can only bring suit against an employer—essentially defined as sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or other legal entity—where the putative plaintiff alleges that the employer engaged in a cover up or attempted a cover up of a previous instance or allegations of sexual assault or other inappropriate conduct, communication, or activity of a sexual nature.

The measure does try to place some guard-rails, but not enough, on the strikingly broad provisions summarized above—AB 2777 requires an attorney to provide a certification to the court after filing a complaint that: (1) they believe a cover-up or attempted cover-up took place; (2) that they had the victim interviewed by a mental health practitioner, who finds a ""reasonable basis to believe"" that ""sexual assault or other inappropriate conduct, communication, or activity"" took place; and (3) that the attorney believes the case is worth filing.

Two Concerning Measures Didn't Hurdle the January Deadline

The bills below were placed on the inactive file in the summer of 2021. Those measures faced a January 31 deadline to come off the file, but the Legislature declined. As such, those measure are now dead, but it is highly likely that the substance of AB 995 comes back in another legislative form in the future.

Worker Metrics: AB 1192

This bill would have placed new onerous administrative burdens on employers by requiring them to publish extensive, private salary and benefit information on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency's (""LWDA"") website. Public disclosure of completely lawful policies and conduct could give the false impression of wage disparity where none may exist and subject employers to frivolous litigation and settlement demands.

Paid Sick Days: AB 995

This bill would have imposed new costs and leave requirements on employers of all sizes, by expanding the number of paid sick days employers are required to provide, which is in addition to all of the recently enacted leave mandates (COVID-19 sick leave, Cal/OSHA emergency paid time off, CFRA leave, workers' compensation, etc.) that small employers throughout the state are already struggling with to implement and comply.

Gone But Not Forgotten: Bills That Failed House of Origin Deadline

The bills below are officially dead for failure to pass before the House of Origin Deadline, but many of the measures can be introduced in a new form in the next session.

COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate: AB 1993

This bill would have added section 12940.4 to the Government Code to require each person who is an employee or independent contractor, and who is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, to show proof to the employer that the person has been vaccinated against COVID-19. By January 1, 2023, each employer in the state would have been required to affirm that each employee or independent contractor complied with these provisions, and the bill would require the employer to affirm that each new employee or independent contractor is in compliance at the time of hiring or contracting with that person.

Flexible Work Schedule: AB 1761

This bill would have enacted the Workplace Flexibility Act of 2022, which would have permitted a nonexempt employee to request an employee-selected flexible work schedule providing for workdays up to 10 hours per day within a 40-hour workweek, and would allow an employer to implement this schedule without the obligation to pay overtime compensation for hours over 8 in a workday.

Altering the Workweek, Hours and Overtime: AB 2932

This bill would have drastically altered the current 40-hours a week, 8-hours a day working paradigm we have followed in this country for decades. Instead of the current requirement that employers pay time and a half for any work above 40 hours, this bill would have required time and a half for work in excess of only 32 hours a week, and would have prohibited an employer from reducing an employee's overall previous compensation as a result of this reduced hourly workweek requirement.

Biometric Information: SB 1189

This bill would have, beginning September 1, 2023, required a private entity in possession of biometric information—fingerprints, retina, or iris images, among others—to develop and make available to the public a written policy establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying the biometric information in its possession. Private entities would be prohibited from disclosing biometric information unless certain criteria are met, including where the disclosure completes a financial transaction requested or authorized by the subject of the biometric information, and from conditioning the provision of a service on the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, sale, or processing of biometric information. Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this measure was that it would have authorized a private right of action against a private entity for violation of the measure.

Worker Metrics: AB 2095

This bill would have required employers with 1,000 or more employees in California to submit various statistics regarding those employees to the LWDA. The LWDA would then use that information to rank employers that would qualify as an employer eligible to be certified as a high-road employer, which comes with certain benefits such as procurement contracts, tax benefits, and workforce development funding. The statute did not define ""high-road"" employer, but rather directed the LWDA to ""develop criteria and a scoring methodology"" to determine what qualifies as high-road employers.

The bill would have required employers to divulge an abundance of wage and hour data, including number of workers in the U.S., median pay for all workers in the U.S., and percentage of full-time workers earning above the U.S. living wage, amongst other disclosures. Additionally, this measure would have required the agency to ""publish on its internet website all worker-related statistics submitted by all employers.""

Family Responsibilities: AB 2182

A repeat of AB 1119 from last year, and labeled a job killer by the California Chamber of Commerce, this bill would have added ""family responsibilities""—defined as the obligations of an employee to provide ongoing care for a minor child or a care recipient—to the list of FEHA-protected characteristics for which employers must engage in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodation to an applicant or employee.

Gender Disparity: SB 1458

This bill would have increased the payment of disability benefits under the workers' compensation system by the percentage of disparity in earnings between genders and would have applied prospectively to injuries occurring on or after January 1, 2023. More specifically, after determining the base amount a worker is owed, this bill would have directed the workers' compensation administrator to add to that amount by the percentage of disparity in earnings between genders as reported by the applicant's employer in its pay data report to the DFEH.

Licensed Manicurists – Independent Contractor Classification: AB 1818

This measure would have made permanent the exception to the ABC test for the determination of worker classification for licensed manicurists. Whether a licensed manicurist is an independent contractor or employee would have been governed by the standard established in S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations.

Exclusivity Options: AB 2926

Some may recall AB 1385 from last year, which dealt with workers in the music and television industries. Assemblymember Ash Kalra took on a similar bill this year but it failed the House of Origin deadline. Specifically, this bill would have prohibited a contract for the exclusive personal services of a musician or actor from containing a term that includes option periods which extend more than six months (for a musician) or twelve months (for an actor) after the earlier of: (a) the satisfaction of the delivery obligation for a contract period by the musician or actor or (b) the initial commercial release of the applicable music product or the actor's commencement of performance.

Opioids: AB 2014

AB 2014 was a spot bill with the stated intent of amending the Labor Code as it relates to Worker' Compensation coverage for injuries caused by the opioid crisis.

Workplace Solutions

While there are some small glimmers of hope, and indeed some measures that would ease administrative burdens on employers, many of the bills that remain are worrisome for the business community. While employers should prepare for the passage of each of the measures above, the legislative session is still in its infancy, and those bill will almost certainly see significant amendments. We'll keep you updated here at Cal Peculiarities, and you can also check out our Policy Matters podcast and newsletter for regular check-ins on California (and national) policy and legislative updates as well.

To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

The House-passed Women's Health Protection Act would have created a federal statute assuring health care providers have the right to provide abortions and patients have the right to receive them.

The effort came amid a political firestorm ignited by a leaked draft opinion that showed the Supreme Court's conservative majority preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade, a landmark 1973 ruling guaranteeing abortion access nationwide.

But it was always a doomed and largely symbolic push, as Democrats already knew they would not be able to secure the 60 votes needed to advance towards a final yes or no vote in the evenly divided 100-member Senate.

In the end, all 50 Republicans and one of the 50 Democrats, West Virginia centrist Joe Manchin, rejected considering the legislation. Manchin's vote was no surprise as he had telegraphed his ""no"" hours earlier.

President Joe Biden vowed never to ""stop fighting to protect access to women's reproductive care"" and urged voters to elect more pro-choice senators.

""Republicans in Congress -- not one of whom voted for this bill -- have chosen to stand in the way of Americans' rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives,"" he said in a statement.

Although the outcome was never in doubt, the rejection is seen as significant, with abortion rights set to be a hot button issue for November's midterm elections, when control of both the House and Senate will be at stake.

A raucous crowd of lawmakers from the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, which passed the legislation last September, gathered on the Senate side of the building chanting ""my body, my decision"" ahead of the vote.

They had been encouraged by new Politico/Morning Consult polling showing 53 percent of voters thought Roe should not be overturned, up three percentage points since last week, while 58 percent said it was important to vote for a candidate who supports abortion access.

""Generally, the people who vote and turn out based on abortion policy are those who support more restrictions on abortion rights,"" said Shana Gadarian, professor of political science at Syracuse University.

""By striking down Roe, this is likely to create a new constituency of pro-choice voters who are activated to turn out and donate in ways that they would not normally in a midterm election.""

Day of action

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested over the weekend that a federal abortion ban is ""possible"" if Roe is overturned, although he has since acknowledged that no position on the issue has ever achieved the 60-vote threshold.

But Democrats seized on the initial remark, arguing that highlighting their disagreement with Republicans could help them in the midterms.

""If we are not successful, then we go to the ballot box,"" Senator Amy Klobuchar told ABC on Sunday.

""We march straight to the ballot box, and the women of this country and the men who stand with them will vote like they've never voted before.""

Activism around the issue is becoming increasingly acrimonious, with angry protesters in favor of abortion rights gathering at the homes of Supreme Court justices in Washington over the past week.

Multiple organisations that support abortion rights have called for a ""massive day of action"" on Saturday, with marches in New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as hundreds of smaller events nationwide.

Police in the nation's capital, still on edge after Congress was attacked by a mob of former president Donald Trump's supporters in 2021, have set up temporary fencing around the court.

The leaked opinion is also spawning renewed calls by progressives to add justices to the court, fueled by the possibility the conservative-majority bench could overturn other landmark decisions.

Colorado Police Respond to Newborn's Death

On Wednesday, June 8, authorities received a report of a deceased female infant in Nunn, Colorado.

Upon arrival, officers discovered a newborn baby who appeared to have stab wounds on her body.

Colorado Police Believe Texas Teen to Be Guilty

The mother of the baby is Leiyla Cepeda, an 18-year-old from Texas, who was in Colorado visiting family.

According to a report from Denver 7, Cepeda was 17 years of age at the time of the baby's birth and allegedly was unaware that she was pregnant. However, Cepeda did state that she suspected she might have been pregnant, but previous pregnancy tests came back negative.

Cepeda's Story to Colorado Police

Cepeda told police that on the day in question she was not feeling well and was experiencing severe cramps, which we now know were contractions. At about 1:30 AM, Cepeda could feel the baby crowning, and she delivered the baby girl in the restroom.

Cepeda told police that the baby, ""fell out"" of her and that she used a small pair of scissors to cut the umbilical cord. The teen told police that the baby did not appear to be breathing, was not moving, and that no sound emerged from the baby.

Afterward, the teen took a shower.

Colorado Police Charge Texas Teen for Newborn's Death

The teen mom denies that she harmed her newborn, but multiple stab wounds that were found on the infant say otherwise.

Leiyla Cepeda was arrested and charged Friday with two counts of first-degree murder in Weld district court.

Kohberger, a 28-year-old former criminology student who attended a nearby university, was arrested in late December, weeks after the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, 20; Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; and Xana Kernodle, 20, whose bodies were found by another roommate on Nov. 13.

Authorities have said he was identified through surveillance video, cellphone tracking and DNA, which was left on a knife sheath found in one of the victims' beds near her body.

New court docs say Kohberger's DNA is a match

Investigators announced previously that they had linked DNA found at the murder scene to DNA from Kohberger's father pulled from trash at the family home in Pennsylvania.

The new court filings reveal that DNA from a swab of Kohberger's cheek has been directly tied to the DNA on the knife sheath.

""The comparison showed a statistical match – specifically, the (short tandem repeat) profile is at least 5.37 octillion times more likely to be seen if Defendant is the source (of the DNA) than if an unrelated individual randomly selected from the general population is the source,"" the filing said.

The DNA from the knife sheath came from a single male source, authorities have said.

How investigators used DNA to link him to the crime

The new court filings shed light on how investigators got the initial DNA match that led them to Kohberger. They started with the genetic material located on the knife and tried uploading it to the Combined DNA Index System or CODIS, a database of DNA from people convicted of crimes, people who have been arrested, and DNA from other crime scenes. But they didn't get a hit.

Next, investigators used a process called Investigative Genetic Genealogy. They uploaded a profile of the DNA sample to a public database where people can upload their own DNA profiles generated by services like Ancestry.com and 23andMe. They built out a family tree based on what they found and used other sources of information like social media and birth and death certificates.

After the Investigative Genetic Genealogy pointed investigators toward Kohberger, they obtained trash from the family home through a search warrant and performed an analysis to confirm that the DNA belonged to the father of the person whose DNA was on the knife sheath. Later still, investigators took a swab from Kohberger's cheek and made a direct comparison.

""Specifically, with respect to DNA, an STR DNA analysis found Defendant’s DNA matched the DNA collected from the Ka-Bar knife sheath,"" the court filing said.

Prosecutors asked the judge to block the release of the information in the Investigative Genetic Genealogy to protect the identities of ""hundreds"" of Kohberger's relatives. They said it isn't relevant to the prosecution because they will be relying on the direct DNA match, not the family tree.

""The IGG process pointed law enforcement toward Defendant, but it did not provide law enforcement with substantive evidence of guilt,"" the filing says.

Prosecutors plan to use the DNA link as evidence during Kohberger's upcoming murder trial, they said in the court filing.

DNA PROFILING:How did investigators use DNA profiling to identify the suspect in the Idaho student killings?

Stabbing deaths rocked local community

The stabbing deaths at the rental house near the University of Idaho, and the subsequent weeks without any leads being made public rocked the community. Officials announced they would raze the house where the crime happened as ""a healing step."" The university said it will memorialize the four students with scholarship funds and an on-campus memorial.

""These tragic murders took four young, vibrant lives from our community. Nothing we do can bring them back,"" Idaho State Police Col. Kedrick Wills said when Kohberger was arrested.

Kohberger was indicted on murder and burglary charges by a grand jury, but the proceedings and most of the evidence remain secret. He could face the death penalty if convicted. A judge entered not guilty pleas on his behalf.

Investigators say Kohberger was a Ph.D. student in criminology at Washington State University across the nearby state line from the University of Idaho.

https://news.yahoo.com/wisconsin-abortion-laws-affected-roe-020429974.html,Here are Wisconsin’s abortion laws and how they would be affected by Roe v. Wade decisions,"MADISON -

A divided U.S. Supreme Court in 2021 left in effect a new law in Texas that prohibits abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and is one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation in May. It bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, and allows private citizens to sue abortion providers. There are no exemptions in cases of rape or incest.

Here’s a primer on Wisconsin’s abortion laws and how they could be affected by court decisions.

More: What to know about Texas abortion law that bans the procedure once heartbeat is detected

Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed abortion legislation and has promised any new restrictions won't be signed into law. But what happens after 2022 if a new governor is elected is less clear.

What are Wisconsin's abortion laws?

Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin have passed legislation in recent years under former Gov. Scott Walker that bans abortions after five months of pregnancy and requires women to receive an ultrasound beforehand. Since 1996, women seeking abortions are required to participate in counseling and wait 24 hours before undergoing the procedure.

But Walker opposed making Wisconsin's other abortion laws more strict and in 2018 signaled he wouldn't sign legislation that banned abortions after six weeks.

Evers has vetoed abortion legislation and has promised any new restrictions won't be signed into law.

""I will always trust women to make decisions about their bodies and their health care,"" Evers tweeted, referencing the Supreme Court's decision to leave the Texas law in place.

Wisconsin 19th century law would take effect if Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade

The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. That’s about two months earlier than what’s allowed under Roe v. Wade and other decisions that have upheld a constitutional right to abortion.

Mississippi has asked the justices to overturn Roe. Such a ruling could result in dramatic changes in Wisconsin because the state has a 19th century law on the books that bans all abortions.

That law has not been enforced for decades, but Roe’s opponents and supporters agree it would go back into effect if Roe were reversed.

The high court is expected to rule on the Mississippi case by the summer of 2022. By then, Wisconsin will be in the middle of campaigns for governor and U.S. senator.

Madison federal judge considering state rules

Separately, a federal judge in Madison is considering whether to strike down some of Wisconsin’s abortion laws.

U.S. District Judge William Conley presided over a trial in December in a lawsuit that challenges laws that prevent nurse practitioners from administering abortions and limit the availability of pills that induce abortions.

Conley has not said when he will issue a decision. However he rules, his decision is all but certain to be appealed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.

Kathy Hochul blames 'white supremacist'","13 people were shot, 10 fatally, Saturday afternoon at a Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, New York.

The suspected shooter, identified as Payton Gendron of Conklin, New York, was arraigned on first-degree murder charges.

Law enforcement officials have called the shooting a ""racially motivated hate crime.""

For the latest updates on the Buffalo shooting, click here.

A gunman wearing tactical gear opened fire in a busy supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo on Saturday, killing 10 people and injuring three others in the country's latest high-profile crime apparently motivated by hate, authorities say.

Officials said the suspected gunman, a white 18-year-old man, traveled several hours across New York to carry out the attack, which he livestreamed on social media. Eleven of the 13 people who were shot were Black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.

Gov. Kathy Hochul called the gunman a ""white supremacist"" who terrorized New York's second-largest city in a ""cold-hearted,"" ""military-style execution"" as people were buying groceries.

""It strikes us in our very hearts to know that there's such evil that lurks out there,"" she said. ""This individual – this white supremacist – who just perpetrated a hate crime on an innocent community, will spend the rest of his days behind bars. And heaven help him in the next world as well.""

The suspect carried an assault weapon inscribed with a racial epithet, said Rep. Brian Higgins, citing briefings with law enforcement officials.

“I was on site for the last three hours, and I listened carefully to what the FBI, police, the district attorney and the U.S. attorney had to say,” Higgins said. “There is no doubt this was a racially motivated attack.”

The suspect, identified as Payton Gendron of Conklin, a New York community about 200 miles southeast of Buffalo, was taken into custody after the attack. He was arraigned on first-degree murder charges and appeared in court Saturday evening wearing a bandage over his shoulder.

John Flynn, Erie County's district attorney, said along with the murder charge, his office and federal authorities were pursuing others, from terrorism to hate crimes.

The supermarket is about three miles north of downtown Buffalo. The surrounding area is primarily residential and is surrounded by homes, along with a Family Dollar store, barber shops, a laundromat and fire station. Authorities said evidence showed the suspect showed racial animosity but declined to elaborate.

Gramaglia said the gunman was wearing tactical gear and was armed with an assault-styled rifle. He parked outside the Tops Friendly Market around 2:30 p.m. and opened fire in the parking lot, killing three people and injuring a fourth. He then went inside and continued his rampage, Gramaglia said.

A retired Buffalo police officer, who was working as a security guard at the store, confronted the gunman and shot him. Authorities said the gunman was hit, but his tactical gear prevented injury.

The gunman returned fire, killing the guard.

'SOLIDARITY IS THE ANSWER':Amid a rise in hate crimes, Black and Asian Americans are standing together

The gunman made his way through the store, firing at others before he was met by law enforcement near the lobby. Authorities said the gunman had his weapon pointed at his head and authorities were able to negotiate his surrender.

“This is the worst nightmare that any community can face, and we are hurting and we are seething right now,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said at a news conference. “The depth of pain that families are feeling and that all of us are feeling right now cannot even be explained.”

The Buffalo attack and the quick determination that the assault was racially motivated drew early parallels to the 2019 attack in El Paso, Texas where a gun man confessed to traveling hundreds of miles to target Hispanics at a local Walmart. The Texas attack left 23 dead. In the Buffalo case, a law enforcement official said, investigators are examining writings allegedly linked to the shooter indicating that the assault was motivated by hate.

“We are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially motivated violent extremism,” said Stephen Belongia, special agent of charge of the FBI's Buffalo field office.

In the past year, FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly warned of the threat posed by racially motivated violent extremists, telling Congress that such cases represent the ""biggest chunk"" of the bureau's domestic terrorism investigations. The same group, Wray told a Senate committee last year, were responsible for the most lethal attacks in the past decade.

Authorities say the gunman livestreamed the attack to social media. The footage shows the gunman, dressed in military gear, pulling up to the front of the store with a rifle on the front seat and then pointing the rifle at people in the parking lot as he exited the vehicle and opening fire, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press.

It also shows the suspect walking into the supermarket and shooting several other victims, the official said.

""This was pure evil,"" Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said. ""It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.""

Higgins acknowledged that authorities were reviewing the contents of a graphic manifesto in which the attacker referenced other racially motivated attackers, including Dylann Roof, an avowed white supremacist, who in 2015 killed nine people at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina.

“This is what all the anecdotal evidence adds up to,” Higgins said.

Braedyn Kephart and Shane Hill, both 20, said they'd just pulled into the parking lot of the store when they saw the alleged gunman leaving and being taken into custody.

“He was standing there with the gun to his chin. We were like what the heck is going on? Why does this kid have a gun to his face?"" Kephart said. He dropped to his knees. “He ripped off his helmet, dropped his gun, and was tackled by the police.”

Hochul said the suspect acquired the rifle used in the attack legally but the weapon had been modified with illegal magazines. New York bars the sale of any magazine that has a capacity over 10 rounds.

She said law enforcement was working to determine where the magazines were acquired but noted they could be purchased as close as Pennsylvania. She didn't elaborate on how many bullets the magazines could hold.

President Joe Biden was briefed on the attack and was praying for those affected, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the shooting “absolutely devastating.""

“Our hearts are with the community and all who have been impacted by this terrible tragedy. Hate and racism have no place in America. We are shattered, extremely angered and praying for the victims’ families and loved ones,"" he added in a statement.

The Rev. Al Sharpton issued a series of posts on Twitter, calling on the White House to convene a meeting with Black, Jewish and Asian “to underscore the Federal government (is) escalating its efforts against hate crimes.” He added “leaders of all these communities should stand together on this!”

Hochul also expressed the need for changes, noting the gunman was active online and shared both his racist views and a livestream of his rampage.

""There's a feeding frenzy on social media platforms where hate festers more hate. That has to stop,"" she said. These outlets must be more vigilant in monitoring social media content.""

Deion King, 20, has been named by the NYPD as the triggerman who fatally shot Keyshawn Cureton, 21, during an argument on W. 136th St. and Lenox Ave. in Harlem on June 27, 2021. Cureton was hit several times and died at Harlem Hospital.

Cops found eight shell casings on the scene, police said.

Cureton, who grew up in the neighborhood but had moved to the Bronx with his mother, was shot during an ongoing turf war between crews that operate on W. 136th St. and W. 139th St. although there was no evidence that he was part of either crew, police sources with knowledge of the case said.

It was not immediately disclosed how King was identified as the one who killed Cureton.

Shortly after the 6:50 p.m. fatal shooting, cops took a suspect into custody, but the man was never charged. A day later, cops released surveillance images of two men involved in the killing and asked the public for help in tracking them down.

“He didn’t deserve that. He didn’t deserve to be shot like that,” his mother Joanna Cureton tearfully told the Daily News after the crime..

“He was working in hotels for doctors and nurses, making sure they’re good,” his sister Latoya Cureton remembered. “My brother took that job on. That’s all he was doing this whole year, he was putting himself out there. That goes to say even more about his character.”

Cureton didn’t live the kind of life that prepared his family for his violent death, his kin said.

“My brother didn’t have an ill bone in his body,” his sister said. “Anybody that met my brother, they got a good vibe off of him.”

Blood, a gold backpack and a pair of sneakers were left at the spot where Keyshawn Cureton was murdered on W. 136th St. in Harlem on Sunday, June 27, 2021.

He can be reached at tayyarinam@hotmail.com and tweets @20_Inam

The Pakistani military authorities under the Peshawar Corps and Foreign Office have been in talks in Kabul with Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) through a 57-member representative Jirga of Wazir, Mehsud and other tribes since first the week of June 2022. As a confidence-building measure, both sides have agreed to extend indefinitely the already announced ceasefire.

This round of talks is also facilitated and mediated by Sirajuddin Haqqani, the chief of Haqqani network and acting Interior Miniter of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), besides IEA’s intelligence, interior ministry and tribal affairs officials.

The EIA is under immense pressure from Pakistan, its supporter and interlocutor, to deal firmly with TTP, whose cross-border attacks on security forces in April alone caused over 120 deaths. Earlier, IEA had shifted TTP fighters to concentrate in Kunar Province (Afghanistan) for better supervision, as disarming the TTP, suggested naïvely by some in Pakistan, is over ask. IEA is divided on strategy dealing with TTP because: a) TTP enjoys support within IEA for partnering during its jihad against the US/NATO forces; b) some conservatives within IEA consider attack on TTP un-Islamic; c) IEA simply doesn’t have the capability to deal with sizeable number of TTP fighters present on Afghan soil; and, d) IEA remains wary of an alliance between an irked TTP and IS-K/or Dai’sh.

Pakistan’s growing impatience with the TTP was demonstrated by its cross-border aerial strikes on 16 April this year. Settling the TTP issue, IEA feels, is basic for its recognition or otherwise by Pakistan/others. Mindful of this important leverage, a pragmatic IEA would want to address this legacy problem. IEA would also want to extend its writ throughout Afghanistan including TTP stronghold in the east; hence IEA’s efforts to make the talks successful “at any costs”.

A grand jirga in South Waziristan district formed a 35-member representative committee on 7 May to spearhead the parleys, after Army gave “deadline to Mehsud tribe to evacuate the area” in order to resume operations. Other participating jirgas are from Malakand, Bajaur and Swat, etc. TTP side is represented by Qazi Muhammad Amir, Mufti Ghofran, Commander Zarar, Omar Khalid Khorasani, Moulvi Faqir Mohammad, Dr Hamood, Mufti Abu Huraira, Hilal Ghazi and Moulvi Asif whereas the government is represented by senior/ranking military and intelligence officials.

As per press reports, one of the TTP demands is to roll back the erstwhile FATA’s merger with KPK (25th Constitutional Amendment) that created the newly-merged districts (NMDs) bearing former agency-names. TTP seeks to re-enact the agreement between Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and tribal elders that guaranteed autonomy to the former FATA. The Supreme Court in 2020 admitted a petition filed against the 25th Constitutional Amendment and issued notices to the government (Federal and KPK) and former FATA lawmakers. That case remains pending.

Other TTP demands include prisoner release; presidential pardon for two key militant commanders, including TTP Swat spokesman Muslim Khan; and compensation for damages to property and loss of life/limb consequent to Pakistan’s military operations. They also want safe passage, freedom of movement and permission to keep arms. TTP Malakand/Swat also demands implementation of Shariah Nizam-i-Adl in the Malakand Division.

Reportedly, various sub-committees are formed to assess damages besides monitoring progress of the talks. A three-member representative committee would smooth over nagging differences. A joint arbitration committee (Pakistani security forces, TTP and IEA) would record progress of ground implementation under instructions from a guidance committee, etc. Both sides, reportedly, agreed to a three-month implementation process.

In October last year, I wrote “Amnesty to Pakistani Taliban — birds and stones”. Some relevant recap is in order. One, the TTP carries a lot of blood on their hands. Their heinous attack on Army Public School in Peshawar on December 16, 2014, killing 150 people, of whom at least 134 were students, is still disturbingly fresh. So, one hopes our interlocutors use this also as quid pro quo to eschew concessions from TTP as is the norm in such cases, rather than extending blanket and unconditional amnesty.

Two, TTP was always in bed with Afghan intelligence agency (NDS) and Indian RAW, along with their patronage by the CIA.

Three, IEA needs to fulfil its repeated commitment not to “let any group or individual use the Afghan soil for actions against any other country or entity”.

Four, IEA does not need a negative leverage of using TTP against Pakistan (at some time), given their immediate, short and long-term interests with and through Pakistan.

Five, TTP is under ba’at (allegiance) to IEA leadership. So, Noorwali Mehsud (TTP Ameer since 2018) would not be able to defy any decree by Ameerul Momineen, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, ordering cessation of hostilities against Pakistan from Afghan soil.

Geostrategically, no insurgency can survive without external havens and support; and with IEA in power, the Afghan swamp is drying up and becoming more inhospitable for TTP. Pakistan-TTP rapprochement helps IEA consolidate its rule, as it reduces ungoverned Afghan spaces.

Internally, any shifting back of TTP would balance out the more secular, erratic and mostly anti-government Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) in the NMDs and vice versa. Moreover, TTP, the myriad grouping of some 13 parties having different ideologies and different levels of motivations, is prone to internal fissures, combat fatigue, loss of morale and social pressure.

Our interlocutors need to deliberate in good measure regarding the re-integration of armed TTP militants back into Pakistani civil life. This entails future good conduct guaranteed by the tribe/quom/family etc, depending upon where the cadre comes from. With FATA dissolved and FCR (Frontier Crimes Regulations) no longer operative, this would be tricky, if not impossible. Some measure of coercion would and should be at the state/tribes’ disposal to deal with ‘black’ militants.

TTP is used to over-ask. It be offered no concessions for non-allegiance to Pakistan’s Constitution. TTP should know NMDs’ reversion back to FATA is mandated by Parliament. It also needs to surrender arms and shun all ties with other armed groups. However, after due cognizance/deliberations, the government can and should withdraw forces from erstwhile FATA, as TTP demands, entrusting all checkpoints to Frontier Corps (FC) and Frontier Constabulary, like in the past.

Our negotiators need to hold nerve and understand without any doubt that the tide is in Pakistan’s favour. Hence undue haste, credit-taking and unnecessary concessions be avoided, even if negotiations are drawn out.

District officials announced that they will adopt panic buttons so teachers can quickly call for help from administrators and law enforcement personnel during an emergency. Police officers will also have a greater presence at Clark County schools, reports the Nevada Independent.

On April 7, a student entered a classroom at El Dorado High School and started punching a female teacher, choking her, and then slamming her head against the table.

Clark County Education Association President Marie Neisess provided an update on the teacher who was attacked, saying the narrative — that the student who allegedly attacked the teacher was distraught over his grades – was false.

https://www.eenews.net/articles/scientists-risk-arrest-to-demand-climate-action/,Scientists risk arrest to demand climate action,"Rose Abramoff drove from her home in Knoxville, Tenn., to the nation’s capital last week to chain herself to the White House fence.

The climate scientist was among seven demonstrators arrested on April 6 (and later released). Their motivation: the dire warning that time is swiftly running out to meet the world’s climate goals, as detailed in a major report last week from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Two days later, Abramoff was back — this time marching with a group of climate activists down I-395 at rush hour. The group was arrested again, but not before they’d stalled traffic on one of Washington’s busiest highways.

In both cases, their demands were clear: faster, stronger climate action from world governments and an end to the burning of fossil fuels.

“It was my first experience with civil disobedience for any reason,” said Abramoff, a climate scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who emphasized that her activism is conducted on her own behalf and does not reflect the positions of her institution. She also spoke with E&E News only on her own behalf.

In the past, she’d participated in marches and worked with nonprofits, community groups and educational programs on issues related to climate change. But most of her previous activities were “fitting into that regular mold of scientists as primarily non-partisan and non-activist,” she told E&E News. “This was my first real departure from that.”

A growing revolution

Abramoff participated in last week’s demonstrations as part of the climate movement “Scientist Rebellion” — a loosely knit, international organization of scientists advocating for stronger climate action through nonviolent protests and acts of civil disobedience. (Abramoff is one of the organizers for participants in the U.S. and Canada.)

Scientist Rebellion started out as a small, largely European movement a couple of years ago, according to Abramoff. It has recently attracted greater attention from scientists around the world. Last November, it held its first coordinated international campaign with demonstrations in Glasgow, Scotland, during a major U.N. climate conference.

Most recently, participants staged demonstrations in cities around the world after the release of the IPCC climate report last week, demanding swifter and stronger global efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

In Los Angeles, four scientists were arrested after handcuffing themselves to the entrance of a Chase bank. In Germany, scientists demonstrated outside the Ministry for Economy and Climate Protection. In England, they protested outside Shell PLC headquarters. They pasted documents to government buildings in Mexico, occupied an oil and gas company’s headquarters in Italy, and threw fake blood onto the facade of the National Congress in Spain.

Scientist Rebellion estimates that a total of around 1,000 scientists in 25 countries participated in last week’s demonstrations, often wearing lab coats to identify themselves.

Many of them were joined by protesters from other movements and organizations. Abramoff was joined in Washington by protesters from climate activist group Declare Emergency and Indigenous activist groups Honor the Earth and Camp Migizi. Extinction Rebellion, an activist movement calling for stronger government action on global threats to the world’s ecosystems and biodiversity, also staged a number of demonstrations around the world last week in response to the new IPCC report.

In an open letter signed by more than 150 scientists from around the world, Scientist Rebellion describes itself as a group of “scientists and academics who believe we should expose the reality and severity of the climate and ecological emergency by engaging in non-violent civil disobedience. Unless those best placed to understand behave as if this is an emergency, we cannot expect the public to do so.”

The group has adopted, as a kind of slogan, the phrase “1.5C is dead. Climate revolution now!” It’s a reference to the Paris climate agreement’s goal to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, if at all possible, or “well below” 2 C.

The world has already warmed by more than a degree Celsius, meaning both targets are rapidly approaching. And the release of the latest IPCC report has called into question the world’s ability to meet the 1.5 C target at all. Global emissions would have to peak within the next couple of years, fall by nearly half within the next decade and reach net zero by midcentury.

While it may be possible to lower global temperatures back down below 1.5 C later on, by physically removing carbon dioxide from the Earth’s atmosphere, many experts believe that overshooting the target — at least temporarily — is extremely likely at this point.

“It is almost inevitable that we will at least temporarily overshoot 1.5,” Jim Skea, an energy expert at Imperial College London and co-chair of the IPCC working group that prepared the report, said in a virtual presentation of the findings last week.

Scientist Rebellion shares many common goals and strategies with other climate activist groups, like its cousin Extinction Rebellion, including an emphasis on nonviolent civil disobedience. Organizers describe the movement — and its emphasis on participation from scientists — as an effort to draw greater attention and credibility to climate activism.

“There is a lingering public perception that activists are extremists who are exaggerating the problem and overreacting by breaking the rules,” the organization’s website states. “Scientists becoming more involved in activism, particularly when it involves arrestable offenses, increases the credibility of civil disobedience. As one of our members puts it: ‘They can’t just dismiss us as a bunch of hippies.’”

‘Clear and present danger’

The scientific community has historically expressed mixed opinions about the extent to which scientists should also become activists on subjects related to their own work. But in recent years, a growing number of scientists have begun to advocate for more activism on the issue of climate change.

“There’s really a paradigm shift that’s starting among scientists about this idea of neutrality and remaining unbiased,” Abramoff said. “I really think that this shift is just an acknowledgment of the inherent humanity of scientists and the fact that we have feelings — and unalienable rights to express those feelings.”

Some scientists have occasionally posed controversial suggestions for activism.

In December, a trio of environmental scientists published an op-ed in an academic journal calling for climate scientists to stage a global strike. Scientists should refuse to conduct any more climate research — at least in areas where they are “simply documenting” the impacts of global warming on the planet — until governments agree to stronger climate action, they suggested.

The paper met with mixed reviews from other scientists voicing their opinions on Twitter. While some sympathized with the authors’ frustrations, others argued that scientists have an ethical responsibility to continue their research and should work to bring about social change in other ways.

Most activists aren’t calling for a moratorium on scientific research. But a growing contingent of scientists around the world are advocating for greater participation in climate activism and environmental justice movements.

“It makes no sense for scientists to stay silent when their science informs them of existential risk from a clear and present danger that’s mounting very, very rapidly,” said Peter Kalmus, a NASA climate scientist. Kalmus also stressed that his activism, and his interview with E&E News, are conducted only on his own behalf and don’t reflect the positions of his employer. “I feel that all scientists should be speaking out like this and taking action,” he said. “And not only that, but scientists have a moral responsibility to do so.”

Kalmus also participated in a demonstration last week as part of the Scientist Rebellion campaign. He and three other scientists donned lab coats and gathered at Pershing Square in LA, where they chained themselves to the entrance of a JPMorgan Chase & Co. bank and called for an end to the burning of fossil fuels. According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase is the world’s top provider of finance to the fossil fuel industry.

On the door behind them, they posted a forest-green sign stating, “We are nature defending itself.”

“The scientists of the world have been ignored, and it’s got to stop,” Kalmus said in an emotional speech as he stood chained to the bank’s door. “It’s time for all of us to stand up and take risks and make sacrifices for this beautiful planet that gives us life, that gives us healthy air.”

Police eventually arrested all four scientists after they declined to clear the area. They were later released.

It was Kalmus’ first experience risking arrest while engaging in civil disobedience, he told E&E News. But he has been involved in various other forms of climate activism for at least 16 years. Kalmus has two teenage sons and says he’s “willing to risk everything” to ensure a livable planet for his children.

“I feel actually genuinely desperate and terrified,” he said. “I can see so clearly where we’re heading in terms of climate change, and I don’t sense any momentum or any intention on the part of world leaders to actually genuinely take care of this planet and take care of this problem, which really does require ending the fossil fuel industry as quickly as possible.”

To reach the Paris Agreement’s climate goals, the IPCC has warned that global emissions should peak by the year 2025. As that milestone approaches, Abramoff said, she anticipates more activism from concerned scientists around the globe.

“Now that we’re sort of a growing movement, I think you’ll probably see increasing rates of actions happening all over the world,” she said. “I think you’ll be seeing a steady smattering, hopefully a slowly growing groundswell of action as the clock ticks down to 2025.”",Q2

Associated Press

SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A man accused of fatally shooting one person and wounding five others at a Southern California church luncheon last year has been charged with dozens of federal hate crimes in connection with the attack, which investigators said was motivated by political hatred of Taiwan.

The indictment announced last week by the U.S. Department of Justice charges David Chou, of Las Vegas, with 98 counts including weapons and explosives charges and forcefully obstructing the free exercise of religion.

Messages seeking comment from attorneys who have represented Chou, 69, in a separate case in state court were not immediately returned.

Authorities said Chou chained and nailed shut exit doors before launching the attack on a gathering of older parishioners from the Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods on May 15, 2022.

Chou had two handguns, bags of ammunition and four Molotov cocktail-style devices, and was motivated by hatred of Taiwan, where he grew up, investigators said.

Among the charges were 45 counts of obstructing free exercise of religious beliefs by force, “which resulted in the death of one person, included attempts to kill 44 others, and involved the use of a firearm and attempted use of explosives and fire,” the Justice Department said in a statement.

Chou was charged last year by Orange County prosecutors with murder and attempted murder including enhancements for a hate crime and other counts. He pleaded not guilty. Online records show Chou is currently being held without bail in Orange County and due back in court July 14.

Authorities said Chou had no prior connection to the church. They said he spent an hour with attendees before the attack, apparently to gain their trust, then closed the doors and started shooting.

The wounded victims ranged in age from 66 to 92.

Chou, a U.S. citizen, grew up in Taiwan after his family was forced from mainland China when communists took control, authorities have said.

If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of death or life in prison without parole.",Q2
