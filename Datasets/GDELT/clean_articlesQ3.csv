Southwest Airlines announced that it will close its reservations centers to go fully remote, effective Sept. 1 of this year.

The airline said that most reservation agents and customer service were already working remotely throughout the pandemic.

More than 3,200 customer service employees based in Albuquerque, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Oklahoma City, and Phoenix and at Southwest headquarters in Dallas will be relocated to work remotely. Those locations will be repurposed to other departments for their use.

“Evolving to a fully remote workforce brings increased flexibility, both in attracting and hiring new employees from across the country, and in scheduling current employees who have worked at record efficiency in a remote work environment,” said Southwest in a statement to CNBC

“Southwest Airlines just announced they are closing all the Reservation Centers and transitioning to 100% remote work,” said the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents the Southwest’s customer service agents, in a note to its members on June 8.

The airline labor union accused Southwest of making the decision unilaterally without employee input.

Southwest said in a press release May 11 that it would invest $2 billion to “transform the customer experience.” That includes using digital technology to simplify check-in services for its passengers.

The airline believes the improved digital self-service will reduce the wait at its airport terminals and will free airline staff for “specialized hospitality and customer service.”

Delta, United, and American Airlines still staff reservations centers and appear to have no intention to change their operations.

Reservation agents at other discount airlines, such as Alaska Airlines and JetBlue, also work remotely. JetBlue’s customer service agents have worked from home since the airline’s founding.

The staff at Southwest’s corporate headquarters already operates on a hybrid home and office model, which the company said is “based on job function and business needs.”

Many companies have adapted their work business models since the pandemic, experimenting with remote models instead of in-office work.

As the pandemic recedes and travel picks up again, the airline industry is struggling to hire new pilots and staff.",Q3

This news will certainly add to the mounting pressure on Putin, who has been under fire by his own Kremlin officials who warned of severe economic and political repercussions of his “special military operation.” The ruble, Russia’s currency, might appear to hold strong, but the waves of economic sanctions from the United States and its allies are definitely taking effect.

The Bank of Russia has said in April that it expects an economic contraction of 8 to 10 percent for 2022, while the International Monetary Fund forecasts 8.5%. If the prediction of the Russian Finance Ministry is true, such a decline could uproot decades worth of economic progress under the Putin administration, according to one insider.

”(The Ministry) expects that the measures taken by the government and the Bank of Russia will make it possible to ease to a large extent the negative consequences of sanctions and ensure stable economic development,” it added.

“Preparation of official macroeconomic forecasts does not fall under the Finance Ministry’s authority,” the Russian Finance Ministry said, claiming the leaked information was inaccurate.

The Russian government has not yet released an official economic outlook since the start of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. However, insider information within the country’s economic ministry says that the agency predicts a more optimistic 8% decline in GDP this year.

The document, obtained from the Russian Finance Ministry by Bloomberg, predicted that the Russian economy would fall by a staggering 12% in its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for this year. To put this into perspective, the figure will be the largest drop-off in Russia’s GDP since 1994, when the country was stumbling towards a capitalist market under Boris Yeltsin’s administration.

A leaked document from Russia privately admits that Russia is bound to face the largest economic collapse in recent history because of devastating sanctions from the West.

The sanctions imposed against Russia affected the situation in the financial sector, spurred the demand for foreign currencies, and caused sales of financial assets, a cash outflow from banks, and surging demand for goods,” Governor of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.

Russia is an export-oriented economy, meaning that a large part of the government’s revenue comes from the goods it sells to its trade partners. With the flurry of economic sanctions, goods from Russia have lost a significant part of its clientele, particularly in Europe.

Europe and Russia have uneasy economic codependency that was growing before the attack on Ukraine. European countries such as Germany and Hungary are highly dependent on oil imports to fuel their thirsty economies. On the other hand, Russia provides them with oil in exchange for much-wanted revenue, which funds the Putin regime.

However, with the outcry over the atrocities in Ukraine and the West taking a stand against Moscow, Russian oil is slowly losing its customers. The United States and Britain were the first ones to ban Russian oil and other Russian imports from Russia, but they were not that significant trading partners, to begin with. However, the big development is that Europe, which buys around half of Russia’s oil, now plans to prohibit such imports into the continent.

The European Commission has proposed a draft that will gradually ban the purchase of Russian oil and petroleum products by the end of the year. If passed, this will spell a catastrophic blow to the Russian oil revenue, which many believe is what fuels Putin’s war machine.

In a recent meeting, the G7 countries – Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, Britain, and the U.S. – have agreed to release another round of sanctions against Moscow, this time targeting Russian media and financial executives.

The group of nations also agreed to follow the United States’ lead to prohibit all imports of Russian oil into their country. Three G7 countries – France, Germany, and Italy, are also in the European Union (EU).

“The main negatives are the oil embargo, the EU is giving up Russian gas, along with more departures from foreign companies,” Chief Economist at the Moscow-based BCS Financial Group, Natalia Lavrova.

“All that will probably expand gradually, with a lot of negative carrying over in on 2023,” Lavrova added. She predicted that Russia’s GDP will shrink by 10.8 percent in 2022 and will be followed by another 5 percent next year. This figure could still grow if more sanctions are imposed on Moscow.

Currently, the Russian economy is believed to be about $1.4 trillion a year. This is in contrast to the United States which has a GDP of nearly $21 trillion a year. Russia’s economic output has fluctuated widely since 2013 when it reached an all-time high of $2.29 trillion. Following the invasion of Ukraine in 2014, its economy contracted to just $1.28 trillion and slowly rose again to 1.69 trillion in 2019 only to see COVID cause another steep drop to $1.48 in 2020.

With economic sanctions hurting Russian exports and denying it imported goods and an estimate of $900 million a day spent on the war in Ukraine, Russia is bleeding out rapidly in trying to sustain not only the war effort but its economy at home.",Q3

DALLAS — Jaylon Levo grew up in Dallas, loved cars and was close to his family.

""He called me every night, and I can’t get over not getting that call,” said Marsha Scott, aunt.

When no one could reach him on Feb. 17, they knew something was wrong.

”We were just talking on the phone and he didn’t call me back,” said Levo's father, Jeremy Smith.

The 22-year-old was robbed and shot at an apartment complex in Duncanville.

“Our family is devastated. I never thought something like this would happen to us,” said Jermeise Smith, aunt.

His father, who is a barber, cut his son’s hair for the funeral.

”He was shot in the left side of his head, and the bullet exited his ear,” said Smith.

Police arrested 18-year-old Cameron Stafford for capital murder.

According to court documents, police said Stafford confessed to being with two juvenile suspects wearing ski masks when Levo was killed.

Stafford’s bond was set by a magistrate at $1 million, but Judge Chika Anyiam lowered it to $150,000. He bonded out.

It’s the second case WFAA has reported on where Judge Anyiam has significantly lowered the bond on a suspect in a murder case.

Although, courthouse sources said other judges are also doing it.

""I’m crying out, and I’m asking for justice for my son,” said Smith.

Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia said he too wants justice for victims and accountability from judges.

""We can’t be the only ones where people demand accountability and transparency,” said Garcia.

He said as cities across the nation struggle with gun violence, they are taking a closer look at the violent suspects being released on bond.

""I don’t think we get to say we are serious about gun crime if that is happening,"" said Garcia.

The Dallas Police Department pulled a sample of 240 cases involving suspects arrested for murder, aggravated robbery and aggravated assault in 2021.

And of those cases, Chief Garcia said nearly 30% were released within two weeks, and 70% of those suspects used guns to commit their crimes.

""And certainly committing offenses like murder, agg assault or agg robbery with a firearm and then being released in two weeks is not reasonable. And I’m sure that the neighborhoods I go to that want more police presence think that’s not reasonable either,” said Garcia.

Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price has led the county’s efforts for bond reform.

He agrees with the chief.

”I see people who are on bond recommitting, and not in six months to a year span, but at times... I’m talking about a month or weeks.”

Dallas PD's numbers show nearly 20% of those released had committed other violent offenses in the same year.

“Often times, these individuals are being released right back in the neighborhoods they came from and revictimizing the people in the communities they came from,” said Garcia.

Commissioner Price said some judges aren’t properly reviewing their cases.

""You’re the judge. You’ve got access you can make a determination if you are doing your job,” said Price.

Commissioner Price said the jail is full of non-violent offenders languishing and awaiting trial, while some violent defendants are released.

“There is no rhythm or reason. No real process,” said Price.

In Levo’s case, court documents show Judge Anyiam said in open court she knows the suspect’s mother who works as a bailiff in the courthouse.

The District Attorney’s Office filed a motion to raise Stafford’s bond after a new prosecutor was assigned the case and learned of the connection.

Levo’s family fears they won’t get justice.

”You put so much into a child and for someone to just snatch him, it’s just not right, and the judge needs to go,” said Jermeise Smith.",Q3

NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, Texas – Almost 20 years after a North Texas police officer was shot and injured by a man who had just robbed a bank, authorities say they used DNA to identify the suspect, who was found dead in Oklahoma as they prepared to arrest him.

Mark Alan Long, 60, was found dead near a cell tower in southeast Oklahoma City, authorities said. While they believe he killed himself, a medical examiner will determine the cause.

In March 2003, North Richland Hills police Officer Jeff Garner, now a captain in the department, was shot in the ankle as he tried to pull over a man for a traffic violation who – unbeknownst to him – had just robbed a bank in nearby Watauga. After reopening the case in 2015, a detective determined the suspect in Garner’s shooting was linked to seven bank robberies from 1998 to 2003. In December 2021, Long was identified as the suspect based on shared DNA matches identified on a public DNA comparison platform, police said.

In February, undercover detectives got Long’s DNA from items he’d used in an Oklahoma restaurant, and that DNA matched DNA collected in some of the bank robberies. In a search of Long’s home this month, a revolver was found that matched evidence from Garner’s shooting, and when authorities located a Jeep that Long had previously owned, damage consistent with a bullet hole was found, police said.

Before Long was found dead, four arrest warrants had been secured. Police said he was to be charged with attempted capital murder of a peace officer, aggravated robbery and two counts of robbery.",Q3
https://whyy.org/articles/shoppers-guard-among-10-dead-in-buffalo-supermarket-attack/,"Buffalo shooter targeted Black neighborhood, officials say","The white 18-year-old who fatally shot 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket researched the local demographics and arrived a day in advance to conduct reconnaissance with the intent of killing as many Black people as possible, officials said Sunday.

The racially motivated attack came a year after the gunman was taken to a hospital by State Police after making threats involving his high school, according to authorities.

He wasn’t charged with a crime and was out of the hospital within a day and a half, police said, but the revelation raised questions about his access to weapons and whether he could have been under closer supervision by law enforcement.

The Buffalo attack prompted grief and anger in the predominantly Black neighborhood around Tops Friendly Market. A group of people gathered there Sunday afternoon to lead chants of “Black lives matter” and mourn victims that included an 86-year-old woman who had just visited her husband in a nursing home and a supermarket security guard, both of whom were Black.

“Somebody filled his heart so full of hate that he would destroy and devastate our community,” the Rev. Denise Walden-Glenn said.

Speaking at the National Peace Officers’ Memorial service at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden said, “We must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America.”

As the country reeled from its latest mass shooting, new details emerged about the gunman’s past and Saturday’s rampage, which the shooter livestreamed on Twitch. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Buffalo native, demanded technology companies tell her whether they’ve done “everything humanly possible” to make sure they’re monitoring violent content as soon as it appears.",Q3
https://www.chalkbeat.org/2022/5/31/23149086/school-hardening-security-uvalde-texas-shooting,"After Uvalde, Texas shooting, familiar calls for more school security","FULLERTON, CA - May 25: A Fullerton Police Department sergeant stands near the entrance to Richman Elementary School in Fullerton, CA on Wednesday, May 25, 2022. Fullerton police had an increased presence at schools a day after a gunman entered an elementary school in Texas and killed 19 students and two teachers.

A lot has changed for Broward County teacher Nympha Girard since a gunman shot and killed 17 students and staff members in her Florida district.

Girard, who teaches at Plantation High School, about 16 miles south of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, recalls that before the tragedy there in 2018, students and staff could enter and exit through multiple doors and gates. Students roamed the halls during class. Girard often stayed into the evening to help students. And there wasn’t much of a security presence.

Now, students, staff, and visitors filter through the “welcome center” — the only point of entry. When a student has to use the bathroom during class, Girard calls for a security guard to escort them. The gates lock after school lets out, which means teachers don’t stay too late. And her school has two police officers and a security manager who are “constantly in your vision.”

Those extra safety precautions do make her feel safer. “I understand we always have to look ahead and go one step further,” Girard said. But still, she’s torn about adding more security, and would prefer to see stricter gun laws. There’s been ongoing debate about adding metal detectors, Girard said, but she’s not convinced they “would make us any safer.”

Girard’s experience illustrates how many schools have already undergone “hardening” in the wake of prior high-profile tragedies. They have hired more security guards and police, installed cameras, added fences outside playgrounds, created one point of entry, and drilled students for the possibility of an active shooter.

Now, after the latest mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, some politicians and education officials want schools to tighten security even more. But the rapid adoption of these measures in recent years highlights how far schools have already gone — and raises questions about how much further they can and should go.

“Schools over the past couple decades have increasingly become more characterized by security measures,” said Chris Curran, an education researcher at the University of Florida. “The tricky balance for schools is we don’t want them to look like forts. We want students to go to a place where it’s welcoming, it’s open, where they’re happy to be there.”

In 2019, two thirds of schools reported having a school security or police officer present, according to a federal survey. That includes a majority of elementary schools and more than 80% of middle and high schools. In just over half of schools, at least one officer is armed with a gun.

Nearly all schools also report maintaining controlled access to their building during school hours, using security cameras, planning for the possibility of an active shooter, and conducting lockdown drills. More than half say they have controlled access to school grounds, too. There have been sharp increases in nearly all security measures in the last two decades.

Despite these security upgrades, politicians are still calling for measures that many schools already have.

Former President Trump, for example, said on Friday that every school building should have one point of entry, metal detectors, and “strong exterior fencing” to prevent intruders from entering schools with a weapon.

A number of Republican governors and some Democrats have shared similar sentiments.

“It’s looking for ways to harden schools,” Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said. “Maybe a single entrance into the school system and making sure educators are trained.”

Prior school shootings have led to the kind of school hardening that some are now calling for again.

Soon after the 2018 Florida shooting, a majority of states pumped money — totalling roughly $900 million, according to an analysis by The 74 — into bulking up security. The federal government has also issued regular safety grants.

The state of Florida began requiring schools to post an armed police officer or guard on every school campus and allowed some teachers to carry guns. The state also set aside $233 million to upgrade school building security over the last four years.

“This funding has made a great impact on schools’ abilities to secure their campuses,” said Cassie Palelis, a spokesperson for Florida’s education department.

Similarly, in 2016 after a community college shooting in nearby Oregon, Idaho passed a law requiring school “threat and vulnerability assessments” every three years.

Guy Bliesner, with the Idaho School Safety and Security Program, conducts some of those assessments. He visits nearly 100 schools a year looking for security lapses like whether doors are left open, and issues a detailed report for each school. Over the years, Bliesner had seen schools put in place more robust safety measures.

“There has been an increasing awareness of security as an operational element at schools,” he said.

Proponents of these measures point out that there are documented instances of school security guards and other police preventing school shootings that had been planned. And some research shows that police in schools can reduce crime unrelated to shootings.

But despite their prominence and horror, mass school shootings remain quite rare. In most years there are fewer than 10 active-shooter events in schools in the whole country. And it’s not clear if tougher security has made schools safer from shootings or other crime.

Schools in Uvalde, Texas, had undergone security upgrades — hiring police officers, conducting active-shooting trainings, and doubling their security budget.

In practice, as the Uvalde tragedy shows, security doesn’t always work as intended: in that case, a back door was left open, school security did not stop the shooter from entering, and local police let the shooter remain in a classroom for nearly an hour before a tactical team burst open the door.

And tougher security can come with real downsides: students may feel less safe at school, and may even do worse in class. Black students, especially, are more likely to be arrested at school and to have more negative feelings about school police.

“You end up creating an environment where you lessen the trust between students and the adults who should be nurturing and protecting them,” said Bacardi Jackson, who co-authored a report about school hardening after the Florida shooting for the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center.

Christina Quintero, who has three children in Houston ISD, watched as her children’s elementary school made changes to its building after the shooting at Texas’ Santa Fe High School in 2018. The district spent $3.4 million after Texas created a $100 million fund for school hardening. Her children’s school now has a single point of entry and staff are “hypervigilant” about who comes in. Visitors have to be buzzed through two sets of “big heavy” doors.

“It does make us feel more secure that our children are going through this,” Quintero said. But the calls from politicians for more spending on school security worry her. “I fear that putting more officers in these schools, putting metal detectors, and basically doubling down will further perpetuate the cycle of the school-to-prison pipeline, especially in minority areas.”

Quintero argues that school hardening doesn’t address the core problem: access to guns.

“That’s just a Band-Aid,” she said. “I guarantee you that it will fail, because we’re not addressing the root of the problem, which is gun violence and our elected officials accepting money from the NRA and not writing feasible policies that will actually protect our students.”

Meanwhile, in Florida, Girard said that repeatedly acting out an active shooter situation can be traumatizing.

“Sometimes things get too far,” she said. “Whenever the drills were over, when the classes moved, you could see it in everyone’s faces. We were all silently crying, because we were scared to death.”

The training has stuck with her in other ways, too. Girard doesn’t open the windows in her classroom now, even though they’re high off the ground. Two months ago, she cracked some for fresh air, but thought twice after worrying it could enable an intruder to hear her students during a lockdown. A student stood outside to listen as her class whispered and moved a chair.

“He said: ‘I heard something,’” Girard said. “So then I closed them.”

Right now, school officials are facing intense pressure to layer on even more security measures. Many parents are scared because of what they’re reading in the news. Many politicians are emphasizing security measures, with some hoping to pivot the conversation away from gun control laws.

Already many school systems have announced more police presence at least for the coming weeks. Some have laid out plans to update their security measures, too. The head of Los Angeles Unified schools, Alberto Carvalho, said the district was reviewing school access points and was considering using a tracking app to give first responders better access to schools.

But even some security experts say that officials need to avoid buying into quick fixes. Within days of the Uvalde shooting, Bliesner in Idaho said he’s received scores of emails from vendors hawking security products.

“Sometimes we just buy something and hang it out there so people say you did it,” he said. “It’s security theater.”

The actions had been expected for several weeks by industry analysts and anti-tobacco advocates.

Yet, it remains highly likely that tobacco manufacturers will have years to adapt to a menthol-free industry, if a menthol ban ever takes force.

The FDA likely will face multiple lawsuits from tobacco manufacturers and anti-smoking groups considering that in 2009, Congress exempted menthol from banned flavorings in traditional cigarettes in the federal Tobacco Control Act.

However, the FDA cites that law as allowing for the proposed ban since “these proposed product standards are based on clear science and evidence establishing the addictiveness and harm of these products.”

“The stock prices of Altria and British American Tobacco have not moved on this news, which is indicative of it not being a significant (investor) concern,” said David Sweanor, an adjunct law professor at the University of Ottawa and the author of several e-cigarette and health studies.

The FDA said its actions “have the potential to significantly reduce disease and death from combusted tobacco product use, the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S.

The next step for the FDA commences May 4 when the public can provide comments on these proposed rules, along with public listening sessions on June 13 and June 15.

The public will have the opportunity to submit either electronic or written comments directly to the dockets on the proposed rules through July 5.

“Once all the comments have been reviewed and considered, the FDA will decide whether to issue final product standards,” the agency said.

FDA incentive

Xavier Becerra, secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, said in a statement that “the proposed rules would help prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers and help adult smokers quit.”

“Additionally, the proposed rules represent an important step to advance health equity by significantly reducing tobacco-related health disparities.”

The FDA has said 30% of all adult smokers and more than 40% of all youth smokers consume a menthol style. About 85% of Black smokers prefer menthol flavoring, compared with 30% of white smokers, the agency said.

Rachel Denlinger-Apte, an assistant professor of social sciences and health policy at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, said that “decades of research has shown that menthol flavoring makes cigarettes more appealing, harder to quit, and are disproportionately used by youth and young adults, Black and African-American individuals, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.”

“Today’s announcement by the FDA regarding a menthol cigarette and flavored cigar ban is a step in the right direction for reducing tobacco-related death and disease and achieving health equity.”

The FDA cited as incentive for its proposed bans that they are “a critical piece of the Biden administration’s reignited Cancer Moonshot to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50% over the next 25 years; 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking.”

FDA also cited published modeling studies that have estimated a 15% reduction in smoking within 40 years if menthol cigarettes were no longer available in the U.S.

The agency stressed that it “cannot and will not enforce against individual consumers for possession or use of menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars.”

“If these proposed rules are finalized and implemented, FDA enforcement will only address manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, importers and retailers who manufacture, distribute, or sell such products within the U.S. that are not in compliance with applicable requirements.”

The FDA said state and local law enforcement agencies do not independently enforce bans contained with the 2009 federal law, “and do not, and cannot, take enforcement actions against any violation of FDA’s tobacco authorities, including its regulations, on the FDA’s behalf.”

Industry response

Analysts and industry experts have said that the FDA clamping down on menthol flavorings is one dramatic regulatory shift from the Trump administration to the Biden administration.

According to Barclays analyst Jain Gaurav, menthol cigarettes account for 35% of cigarettes sold in the United States.

That includes more than 50% of cigarette volumes for both Reynolds American Inc., which makes No. 2-overall traditional menthol cigarette Newport and Camel menthol brands, and for ITG Brands Inc., which makes Kool and Salem menthol brands.

Gaurav said U.S. menthol cigarette sales account for 25% of overall profits for Reynolds’ parent company, British American Tobacco Plc., as well as 15% of ITG’s parent company Imperial Brands Plc.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. said in a statement Thursday that “we strongly believe that there are more effective routes to deliver tobacco harm reduction than banning menthol in cigarettes.”

“Evidence from other markets, including Canada and the European Union where similar bans have been imposed, demonstrates little impact on overall cigarette consumption.”

Reynolds said its viewpoint on scientific studies on menthol flavorings is that they “show no difference in the health risks associated with menthol cigarettes compared to non-menthol cigarettes, nor does it support that menthol cigarettes adversely affect initiation, dependence or cessation.

“As a result, we do not believe the published science supports regulating menthol cigarettes differently from non-menthol cigarettes.

“We believe our portfolio of scientifically substantiated reduced risk products can play a critical role in its delivery,” Reynolds said. “We will continue to work with FDA to support access and choice for adult consumers.”

Philip Morris USA, which makes top-selling Marlboro, said in a statement Thursday that “we believe harm reduction, not prohibition, is the better path forward.”

“Taking these products out of the legal marketplace will push them into unregulated, criminal markets that don’t follow any regulations and ignore minimum age laws.

“We will continue to engage in this long-term regulatory process.”

Next steps

Gaurav provided on April 22 how he sees the next steps unfolding.

“We are on step 3/4 of a 9-step process,” Gaurav said.

“Every step of this process takes at least four months. This will mean that any final rule by the FDA is at least two years and more likely three years away.”

Among the FDA’s considerations are addressing scientific, legal, law enforcement, public health, industry and budgetary stakeholders.

Gaurav said the FDA will need to respond to all the comments in an iterative process before it can publish a final rule.

“The industry will also likely pursue litigation once a final rule is published,” he said. “This can add another 1-3 years. The industry can request an injunction on implementation of a menthol ban during the time the issue is under litigation.”

Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog said Thursday that “while there is some risk a federal ban on menthol cigarettes could reduce smoker initiation and potentially be a catalyst that prompts a number of smokers to quit, thereby having some negative impact on cig volumes, we continue to believe a more likely scenario is for menthol cig users to convert to non-menthol cig products or to reduced-risk products that have a menthol variant such as e-vapor.”

“Following the menthol ban in the EU, BAT noted more than 90% of cigarette smokers remained in the cigarette category. Of those who stopped smoking, 70% moved to vaping.

“Importantly, the FDA’s guidelines require that, for this menthol ban on cigarettes to be implemented, it needs to be proven that it is science-based and does not have any unintended consequences,” Herzog said. “This could make for a lengthy process and an uncertain outcome.”",Q3
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/21/police-response-in-uvalde-shooting-was-abject-failure-official,Police response in Uvalde shooting was ‘abject failure’: Official,"Texas Department of Public Safety official said there were enough police officers to stop the shooting three minutes after the gunman entered the school.

The law enforcement response to a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas that killed 19 children and two teachers was “an abject failure” in which a commander put the lives of officers over those of the children, Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Director Steven McCraw has said.

During a Texas Senate hearing into the May 24 mass shooting on Tuesday, McCraw reiterated that as many as 19 officers waited more than an hour in a hallway outside classrooms 111 and 112 before a US Border Patrol-led tactical team finally made entry.

“There is compelling evidence that the law enforcement response to the attack at Robb Elementary was an abject failure and antithetical to everything we’ve learned,” McCraw said.

The development came amid sustained criticism about the police actions after the gunman entered Robb Elementary School and began shooting. Many parents and relatives have expressed deep anger about the police response.

The shooting, one of the deadliest school shootings in US history, happened less than two weeks after a self-declared white nationalist shot dead 10 people in Buffalo, New York. The shootings have reignited a national debate on gun violence, and triggered renewed calls for stricter gun control measures.

On June 8, survivors and relatives of gun violence victims testified before a Congressional committee in a new plea for gun control in the US.

McCraw said the classroom door in the elementary school was not locked even as police waited for a key, and there was no evidence any law enforcement officer ever tried the classroom door to see if it was locked.

“I don’t believe based on the information we have right now that door was ever secured,” the director added. “He [the shooter] didn’t have a key … and he couldn’t lock it from the inside.”

“The officers had weapons, the children had none. The officers had body armour, the children had none. The officers had training, the subject had none. One hour, 14 minutes, and eight seconds – that is how long the children waited, and the teachers waited, in Room 111 to be rescued,” the DPS director said.

“Three minutes after the subject entered the west building, there was a sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armour to isolate, distract and neutralise the subject,” McCraw added.

“The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers from entering Room 111, and 112, was the on-scene commander, who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children,” the director said in the hearing.

McCraw said the scene commander, Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, “waited for radio and rifles, and he waited for shields and he waited for SWAT”.

Arredondo earlier this month said he never considered himself the incident commander at the scene of the shooting, and that he did not order police to hold back on breaching the building.

Arredondo told the Texas Tribune that he left his two radios outside the school because he wanted his hands free to hold his gun. He had said he called for tactical gear, a sniper and keys to get inside, holding back from the doors for 40 minutes to avoid provoking sprays of gunfire.

Community members along with parents of the victims urged Arredondo to resign during an impassioned school board meeting on Monday, ABC News reported.",Q3
https://www.selectscience.net/industry-news/perkinelmer-and-novartis-announce-collaboration-to-combat-sickle-cell-disease-in-africa?artID=57700,PerkinElmer and Novartis announce collaboration to combat sickle cell disease in Africa,"PerkinElmer Inc. has announced that it is collaborating with Novartis to expand newborn screening for sickle cell disease (SCD) in sub-Saharan Africa. PerkinElmer together with the Novartis Africa Sickle Cell Disease program aims to expand advocacy efforts to educate patients, caregivers, and communities about the importance of newborn screening and early intervention with hydroxyurea (HU) and other SCD treatments.

Newborn screening for SCD and comprehensive disease management in high-income countries like the United States has reduced mortality in children under five years old by 94%[1]. Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa which bears the highest burden of the disease, no national newborn screening program exists. This collaboration aims to galvanize governments to provide universal newborn screening as part of national health programs in support of early diagnosis and comprehensive interventions such as prophylactic penicillin, a pneumococcal vaccination and therapies like HU. With effective screening and management of SCD, governments could save many precious lives.

The Novartis Africa Sickle Cell Disease program was launched in Ghana in 2019 as an end-to-end effort that encompasses SCD screening, diagnosis, treatment, education, research and advocacy. Today this unique program has been expanded to Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia, with plans to reach a total of 10 countries.

Among its varied contributions to the program, PerkinElmer will work toward strengthening existing SCD programs by providing training, consultations, support and related services to health care professionals and lab technicians across participating countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The Company will also help establish new lab facilities to build capacity for SCD screening in participating countries.

“As a global leader in newborn screening solutions we are pleased to be working with Novartis to assist people across sub-Saharan Africa affected by this condition,” said Petra Furu, general manager, reproductive health at PerkinElmer. “By building awareness around the importance of newborn screening, our hope is that more babies receive an early diagnosis that leads to earlier treatment – ensuring they have the best possible chance of a healthy start to life.”

“This collaboration with PerkinElmer reaffirms our commitment to reimagining care for sickle cell disease patients, by accelerating access to national newborn screening and hydroxyurea through public-private partnerships with local governments and other organizations,” said Racey Muchilwa, Country President and the Head of Novartis sub-Saharan Africa. “We will also be educating patients, caregivers and communities on the importance of newborn screening, early intervention and treatments while elevating the capacity for healthcare professionals to address the high unmet need of SCD.”

In an initiative announced in March 2021, PerkinElmer works alongside the American Society of Hematology and its Consortium on Newborn Screening in Africa (CONSA) to provide resources for SCD screening programs in countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia and Tanzania. Novartis announced its partnership with ASH in early June, which will advance ASH’s CONSA objectives to demonstrate the benefits of newborn screening and early interventions for children with SCD and create a sustainable infrastructure for SCD newborn screening.

The candidate elected will run in the general special election to serve alongside another Cornell undergraduate and fourth ward alderperson, Jorge DeFendini ’22.

Prior to becoming alderperson, Mehler was the president of Cornell Votes, a student organization he co-founded, and he was later appointed the Student Assembly Director of Elections. During his time serving for these organizations, the University has seen a 31 percent increase in voter turnout in the fall and a 33 percent increase in the spring.

“My energy was focused on just getting students involved with their civic processes, getting students involved with whatever civic engagement meant to them,” Mehler said. “For some people that means voting, for other folks that means organizing –– it means democracy.”

Since being sworn into the office in October 2021 to fill a vacancy after prior Alderperson Steve Smith’s resignation, Mehler has partnered with Collegetown’s Small Business Alliance to support local businesses throughout the pandemic. Mehler and Graham Kerslick, former Fourth Ward alderperson, secured more than $2 million for reconstruction of College Avenue.

On April 6, Mehler passed a bill that extends the time period tenants have to renew their rental agreement or agree to have their unit shown to prospective new tenants.

Kumar likewise has been involved in several political campus organizations, including Cornell Progressives, Cornell Democrats and Sunrise Ithaca. Kumar has also worked with the Ithaca Tenants Union seeking to pass Right to Renew and Good Cause Eviction laws in the city of Ithaca and has sought to advocate for a $15 minimum wage for student workers with the People’s Organizing Collective. Kumar has been endorsed by local chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America as well as the Working Families Party.

“[Kumar] strikes me as very intelligent and principled and committed to her values, which I think aligns very well with the WFP values,” said Stephanie Heslop, an Ithaca resident and Tompkins County WFP chair.

“I work at Starbucks here in Ithaca and the Collegetown workers walked out on Saturday because of unsafe working conditions and Tiffany was on the picket line with us,” Heslop said,

“[with] her background as an activist and organizer, she has on-the-ground experience, fighting for policy to help working people such as good cause eviction.”

Kumar expressed a desire to promote progressive policies if elected as alderperson.

“I think that that’s definitely going to be an uphill battle when it comes to more housing protections but [in] having Right to Renew and Good Cause Eviction laws, the precedent has been set by other places in New York by other cities,” said Kumar. “It’s something that the city council should be responsible for –– it’s something the local government has a responsibility to do.”

Kumar said she will run on the Working Family Party ticket in the general special election regardless of the outcome of the primary.

Mehler has been endorsed by several key city officials, including the current and the former mayor and every former fourth ward alderperson since 2014.

First Ward Alderperson George McGonigal, a member of the Common Council, is another of Mehler’s endorsers, and said that Mehler is a good advocate for his ward.

“He listens to other points of view and he tries to take in how problems have arisen,” McGonigal said. “He tries to learn about the issues before he makes a decision, and I think that’s a real strong point.”

Graham Kerslick, current executive director of the Cornell Atkinson Sustainability Center and former fourth ward alderperson from 2012 to 2021, has also endorsed Mehler.

“I’ve worked for a short time with Patrick, but even in that period I recognized some of his most important qualities,” Kerslick said. “Like his enthusiasm to tackle challenging problems and his willingness to work with colleagues on Council on a whole range of issues, not ones that just affect students.”

Other organizations have expressed frustration with Mehler’s policies. The Ithaca Tenants Union has pursued the Right to Renew and Good Cause Eviction Bills, policies that would require the prioritization of current tenants when seeking to renew their leases and regulate the grounds on which landlords can pursue evictions.

Genevieve Rand, an organizer at the ITU, said that Mehler’s housing bill contained only a part of Good Cause Eviction, and fell short of the organization’s goals by removing enforcement mechanisms originally proposed.

Rand expressed support for Kumar’s campaign.

“[Kumar has] shown up to tenants rights and housing justice rallies for some time now, since long before the race for ward four was even a conversation,” said Rand. “It does really mean something when tenants are trying to demonstrate power, collectively and in public she would show up.”

DeFendini has also publicly endorsed Kumar saying that the fourth ward is a younger and more progressive ward that is ripe for change, which Kumar hopes to champion. Defendini noted the difference in political alignment between himself and Mehler, and said that while Mehler takes a pragmatic stance on issues, DeFendini is a self-described “outright progressive.”

“Tiffany is an organizer at heart and by trade, and I feel that you need someone with that organizing experience for this ward,” said DeFendini. “Building the solidarity slate, a lot of local groups came together, and it is a testament to how the people of Ithaca want this change to be reflected in the council, and Tiffany’s campaign does that.”

Mehler and Kumar now face off on the campaign trail in preparation for the democratic primary, with both collecting endorsements and support from their prospective constituents, as Kumar seeks to make up ground against her incumbent rival.

“I think that we have a lot of strengths when it comes to grassroots organizing that shows in how well we were able to collect signatures when we were petitioning to get on the ballot,” Kumar said, “Because we know how to mobilize, [and] we know how to knock on doors.”

The primary election will take place on June 28 and any Ithaca-registered Democrat within the Fourth Ward will be eligible to vote. The general election will occur on Nov. 8.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61604652,Uvalde shooting: Texas police change key details as criticism mounts,"Police in Texas have revised key details about Tuesday's deadly school shooting as criticism mounts from parents over the initial response.

The gunman roamed outside the Uvalde school for 12 minutes before entering unchallenged, police said on Thursday.

That contradicted earlier statements which said the attacker had been confronted and shot at by an officer.

He killed 19 children and two teachers before he was shot dead 90 minutes after he arrived, police said.

That delay, combined with video footage showing frustrated parents being tackled and handcuffed by police while the gunman was still inside the school, has led to growing public anger and scrutiny of the early response.

It has also called into question claims by state Governor Greg Abbott, who earlier this week hailed the ""quick response"" of ""valiant local officials"" who he said had engaged the gunman before he entered the school. ""They showed amazing courage by running toward gunfire,"" he said.

A new timeline was given at a news conference on Thursday by Texas Ranger Victor Escalon, who repeatedly said that he wanted to ""clear up"" previous statements. He defended the police response and spoke of the emotional toll the shooting had taken on officers. ""We're all hurting inside,"" he said.

Officials were due to speak again on Friday amid criticism and further questions about why 18-year-old Salvador Ramos was inside the school for more than an hour before he was killed - not by local officers, but by a tactical unit led by US border agents.",Q3

https://www.wlrn.org/politics/2022-04-15/heres-what-floridas-lawmakers-didnt-do-notable-failed-bills,Here's what Florida's lawmakers didn't do: Notable failed bills,"Gov. Ron DeSantis continued this week to sign into law some of the measures Florida’s Republican-led Legislature passed this session, but thousands of bills died in Tallahassee and never made it to the governor, including some on notable issues.

In the House and Senate, lawmakers proposed 3,685 pieces of legislation, but only about 285 passed in both chambers, slightly higher than the number since at least 2016, according to legislative records.

Lawmakers passed a $112 billion state budget, as the session ended after votes on controversial legislation aimed at cultural issues unsettled between conservatives and progressives.

DeSantis signed a bill Thursday banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Other new Florida laws ban instruction or conversations about sexual orientation or gender identity in some elementary grades, and allow parents to sue public schools if students were made to feel uncomfortable over lessons about historical events because of their sex or race.

Here’s a partial list of what lawmakers didn’t do during their 60 days of work.

Property insurance

Lawmakers didn’t tackle reforms over property insurance for homeowners, who have seen premiums surge ahead of hurricane season. Some insurance companies have pulled out of Florida, putting upward pressure on prices. Some policies have doubled in cost.

Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, and other lawmakers have formally asked that the Legislature consider the subject when it reconvenes next week for a special session to consider new congressional maps for Florida. Nothing has been set to happen yet.

Building safety

Months after the collapse of the Champlain Towers South condominium building in June killed 98 people in South Florida, lawmakers couldn’t agree on any new laws requiring mandatory inspections of such buildings – or how homeowners could be compelled to pay for necessary repairs – to prevent another disaster.

One bill died when the sponsors of the respective Senate and House bills, Sen. Jennifer Bradley, R-Orange Park, and Rep. Daniel Perez, R-Miami-Dade, could not agree on terms.

That bill would have established mandatory building inspections for all multi-family residential buildings three or more stories in height. The inspections would be performed once the building reaches 30 years old and then every 10 years. For buildings within three miles of the coast, the milestone inspection would be performed once the building reaches 20 years and then every seven years.

The bill also tried to compel building associations to establish reserves to fund critical maintenance. Negotiations between the bill sponsors broke down when they couldn’t come to agreement over when reserves needed to be established for critical structural repairs.

DeSantis said this week that if lawmakers were able to reach agreement, he would include the bill in the upcoming special legislative session.

“If they can do it, they can do it absolutely, but they have to agree on something,” DeSantis said. “The minute they tell me that that is something they can get across, we can add it absolutely.”

Also this week, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., urged DeSantis to get involved to help get the bill passed.

“I ask the governor and state lawmakers to find common ground to stop the next Surfside tragedy from ever happening,” Wasserman Schultz said. “We owe that much to the victims.”

Marijuana

Bills aimed at fast-tracking the legalization of recreational marijuana died. Democrats withdrew a doomed bill that would have laid the groundwork for how legal recreational marijuana could work in Florida. It would have mimicked tobacco usage legislation already in place.

“Just a really constant pattern of demonizing cannabis usage when a majority of Floridians don't share that sentiment,” said Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando. She said she intended to file the bill again next year, if she wins re-election in November. Eskamani said she hopes the next wave of House leadership is more open to legalized marijuana in Florida.

Kratom

A bill by Sen. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, who is also chairman of the Florida Republican Party, would have regulated a different drug, kratom, a medicinal plant with opioid properties. Gruters withdrew the bill after it passed two committees unanimously but then stalled. The Florida Kratom Consumer Protection Act was intended to protect people’s rights to consume the drug safely in Florida, Gruters said.

Sarasota County has banned possession of kratom, citing the decision by the U.S. Army and Navy to ban the drug. Their findings said the drug has addictive properties and causes symptoms like dry mouth, insomnia, anorexia, hallucinations and confusion.

Gruters said the drug is good overall and wants to prevent manufacturers from mixing the drug with harmful substances. The drug can be found in many smoke shops around the U.S. and is typically consumed in tea.

Research on the drug is limited, but researchers are looking into its potential to help relieve chronic pain and withdrawal effects from other substances, mainly opioids. Recent studies showed that almost 95% of people who took kratom while on another drug stopped using the other drug, said Oliver Grundmann, a clinical professor at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy studying the drug.

One area of concern for researchers is the drug’s post-harvest process, said Christopher McCurdy, a UF medicinal chemistry professor and director of the UF Translational Drug Development Core.

A compound that appears to be generated after leaves are harvested needs to be eliminated from the market for safe use, and the Florida Kratom Consumer Protection Act would have helped do that, he said.

Impaired driving

A bill by Sen. Lori Berman, D-Boynton Beach, would have expanded the types of drugs covered under Florida’s laws against driving under the influence. She withdrew the bill after failing to receive support from some lawmakers and criminal defense legal experts.

It would have closed what Berman called a gap in Florida’s impaired driving laws by expanding the definition of “controlled substances.” The new definition would include prescription, over-the-counter and psychoactive or designer drugs that could affect drivers behind the wheel. Currently, drivers who are pulled over under the influence of such drugs can be charged with reckless driving, not driving under the influence, which carries tougher penalties.

“We want people who are actually under the influence and who shouldn’t be driving to be actually charged with driving under the influence,“ Berman said.

Critics feared the bill could cause unwarranted DUI arrests. Aaron Wayt, a DUI lawyer in Tallahassee and legislative chairman for the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said drinking an excessive amount of alcohol is not the same as taking a prescription medicine with a drowsiness side effect, and the two shouldn’t be punished the same way. One suggested change to the bill would have exempted people with a doctor’s prescription, Wayt said.

Digital license plates

A digital driver’s license pilot program is already underway in Florida, but the Legislature decided not to go ahead with a similar program for modernizing license plates.

A bill by Rep. Nicholas X. Duran, D-Miami, would have directed the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to conduct a pilot program testing out digital plates to replace metal ones. It passed two committees unanimously then was withdrawn when it appeared headed nowhere.

During legislative debate over the bill, Durant said it was important that the digital plates – which could be used to track a driver’s movements – keep such information private. The plates could also be used to pay tolls, display emergency alerts, such as those for missing people, or warn police that the car had been stolen.

Durant’s bill would have given Florida six months to plan and carry out the test program. Another option would have limited testing to government-owned vehicles. The cost of the plates could vary, depending on whether drivers were charged for their wireless connectivity. In other states, they cost several hundred dollars.

‘Free kill’ law

For a second consecutive year, lawmakers did not change a controversial Florida statute derided by critics as its “free kill” law, which prevents families from filing medical malpractice lawsuits against doctors or hospitals when victims are adults.

To keep malpractice costs low, lawmakers in 1990 prevented anyone over 25 from suing doctors for pain and loss judgments in malpractice lawsuits over the death of a parent if the parent were divorced or unmarried. The law permitted claims by surviving spouses or minor children. Critics said it eliminated a major consequence – big cash payouts to surviving family members – after botched surgeries or medical treatments.

The law also similarly prevented parents of unmarried or childless adult children from suing for those judgments. Lawmakers said they were trying to hold down medical malpractice insurance rates and discourage doctors from moving their practices to other states with friendlier business climates.

A bill by Sen. Ana Maria Rodgriguez, R-Doral, would have allowed parents of their adult children to win pain and suffering damages in medical malpractice lawsuits. It was postponed during the last few judiciary committee meetings, effectively killing its chances.

A House version of the bill, by Rep. Spencer Roach, R-North Fort Myers, cleared the House committees but died waiting for the Senate to take action. Advocates for changing the law said they planned to try again next year.

Plane tax exemption

An effort to repeal the sales tax on sales and leases of private planes – including expensive jets popular among CEOs, celebrities and athletes – failed. Lawmakers said the tax break would have encouraged plane manufacturers to come to or stay in Florida and created more jobs.

Sen. Travis Hutson, R-Palm Coast, who filed one of the bills, said the measure would have cost local governments $6.9 million to $7.5 million in lost taxes. He said some other states were offering similar tax cuts. New York, Delaware, North Carolina and South Carolina are among states that have little or no sales tax on aircraft sales.

“We're at fear of losing some of the manufacturers that we currently have here,"" Hutson said.

Planes sold, delivered, used or stored in Florida are subject to a 6% sale and use tax.

Previous efforts to repeal the sales tax on aircraft sales had failed because the state couldn’t afford to lose those tax revenues, said Rep Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart, who filed the House version of the bill.

Free menstrual products in schools

Democrats withdrew a bill that would have required school districts to offer free menstrual products to students in school nurses’ offices or other school facilities, after it wasn’t making headway.

Rep. Kelly Skidmore, D-Boca Raton, and Rep. Michael Grieco, D-North Bay Village, sponsored the Learning with Dignity Act. Skidmore said these products are a necessity and should be viewed as equivalent to toilet paper or paper towels.

Skidmore said she was concerned about girls who have to leave class because they don’t have access to these products, or girls who can’t afford them.

About 62% of the 2.8 million public school students qualified financially for free and reduced lunch, according to figures from the Florida Department of Education.

“How do we keep our high expectations of students when we, as the adults in the room, don't make sure they have what they need to be there and just show up?” Skidmore asked.

There isn’t a uniform agreement across Florida school districts how menstrual products should be distributed. Rep. Stan McClain, R-Ocala, chairman of the secondary education subcommittee where the bill died, told Skidmore he wanted more details about how each county deals with such distributions, she said.

In Tallahassee, the Leon County School District has installed 30 dispensers for menstrual products in eight middle schools and six high school girls’ bathrooms at a cost of $14,000, said spokeswoman Heather Thomas. The products are funded by a partnership with the Foundation for Leon County Schools and donations from the community.

California, New York, Illinois, New Hampshire, Virginia and other states have either agreed to offer free menstrual products in schools or are considering similar measures.

Children’s autopsies

Lawmakers considered keeping details secret about the deaths of children who die in domestic violence cases, in deference to the mother of two young boys murdered last summer by their father. Bills to block release of autopsy reports in such cases were making progress in the House and Senate, until the Senate version stalled and was withdrawn.

The effort was one of 36 bills to limit government records or information that must be disclosed under Florida’s public records law. In the end, lawmakers passed six of them, including a law protecting the identities of victims of sexual harrassment.

Under Florida law, autopsies are considered public records, which can be released to anyone who requests a copy. These new autopsy measures would have blocked public access to autopsies of anyone under the age of 18 who were killed in domestic violence.

Rex Reinhart, 14, and his brother, Brody, 11, were fatally shot by their father, Paul Reinhart, at the family’s vacation home in Dixie County before Paul set the home on fire and killed himself. His estranged wife, Minde Reinhart, told lawmakers she opposed public release of her sons’ autopsy reports, which showed they had been shot. During a frantic search while the boys were missing, deputies were operating under information that Reinhart did not own any guns.

Rep. Charles ”Chuck” Clemons, R-Jonesville, said he will submit the bill again next year.

“I don’t think any friends of young students should have to be able to read stuff like that off of the internet, and have lasting memories or repercussions of the things they have read in the autopsy reports,” Clemons said. “I don’t think it’s reasonable.”

https://theintercept.com/2022/05/19/israeli-investigation-killing-palestinian-american-journalist-ends-begins/,Israeli Investigation Into Killing of Palestinian American Journalist Ends Before It Begins,"Israel’s military police have reportedly decided not to open any criminal investigation into the fatal shooting of the Palestinian American reporter Shireen Abu Akleh, even though newly released video appears to contradict the Israeli army’s claim that the journalist was standing close to Palestinian militants when she was shot last week in the occupied West Bank.

Amos Harel, the senior military correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, reported on Thursday that the decision not to investigate the Israeli soldiers who might have fired the fatal shot came after an internal review by the commando unit of the Israel Defense Forces “found six instances of IDF gunfire at armed Palestinians who were near Abu Akleh” as she reported on an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in Jenin.

According to Harel, the criminal investigations division of the Israeli army simply accepted the accounts of the soldiers who opened fire but “testified that they did not see the journalist at all and aimed their fire at gunmen, who were indeed nearby.”

However, within hours of Harel’s report, video posted on Twitter by Rushdi Abualouf, a Palestinian journalist for the BBC, appeared to contradict the claim that Abu Akleh was near any Palestinian gunmen engaged in a firefight with Israeli troops. The clip shows that Abu Akleh and several other journalists, all wearing blue vests marked “Press,” were instead walking in the direction of the Israeli soldiers, as young men behind them stood around talking and joking, when shots suddenly rang out and Abu Akleh and a colleague were both hit.

New video shows the last few seconds before #ShereenAbuAkleh was shot killed , there was no shooting, and people were milling around in a relaxed way, her family accused idf but #Israel said the fatal shot could have come its forces or #Palestinian militants. pic.twitter.com/XjlRWLlSgN — Rushdi Abualouf (@Rushdibbc) May 19, 2022

As the writer and political analyst Yousef Munayyer explained on Twitter, “At the start of the video you can see the mood is relaxed, what they are saying isn’t really clear mostly because they are chuckling.” After multiple shots are heard and the young men scatter, a voice is heard saying, “Did anyone get hit?” and calling for an ambulance. Then, after more shots, someone shouts, “Shireen! Shireen!” and, amid frantic calls for an ambulance, the desperate warning: “Stay where you are, don’t move!”

Video posted on the day of the killing last week appeared to show that people who tried to reach the mortally wounded Abu Akleh were fired on as they approached her.

Harel also reported that there were no plans for a real criminal investigation of the Israeli soldiers because “such an investigation, which would necessitate questioning as potential criminal suspects soldiers for their actions during a military operation, would provoke opposition and controversy within the IDF and in Israeli society in general.”

This latest evidence of impunity for Israel’s army outraged critics of the ongoing Israeli occupation, which imposes military rule over millions of Palestinians living in territory seized during war in 1967. “Israel is actively calling the bluff of all the countries that demanded it conduct an investigation,” observed Edo Konrad, the editor of +972, an online, nonprofit magazine run by a group of Palestinian and Israeli journalists. “It knows no one will hold it accountable, that the money will keep flowing, while at the same time ensuring that no [sic] will ever ‘truly know’ who killed Shireen Abu Akleh,” Konrad added.

While commentators in the United States asked how the Biden administration would react to the news that Israel’s military was refusing to conduct the thorough investigation it had committed to just a week ago, senior American officials have gone out of their way in recent days to demonstrate what national security adviser Jake Sullivan called “ironclad support for Israel’s security.”

We discussed ironclad support for Israel’s security, ways to address Iranian aggression, efforts to lower tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, and support for Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/wffWZ8pnB0 — Jake Sullivan (@JakeSullivan46) May 19, 2022

As Sullivan met with Israel’s defense minister, Benny Gantz, at the White House on Thursday, the Israeli army was celebrating a friendly visit to Israel by Lt. Gen. Michael Kurilla, the new commander of U.S. Central Command.

The killing of Abu Akleh might not have shaken Israel’s relations with the U.S., but it has destabilized the country’s fragile coalition government. On Thursday, a left wing lawmaker cited the Israeli police attack on mourners at the funeral of the beloved Palestinian-American correspondent in Jerusalem last week as one of the reasons that she was withdrawing her support for the government, which could force new elections.

Ghaida Rinawie Zoabi, a Palestinian citizen of Israel who represents the Meretz party, wrote in a letter explaining her decision that her hope that Arabs and Jews could work together to bring about “a new path of equality and respect” had been dashed by a series of “hawkish, hard-line and right-wing positions” taken by the coalition’s leaders. The sight of the police attacking mourners at Abu Akleh’s funeral, and nearly causing them to drop the coffin, prompted her to make what she called “a moral decision” to stop supporting the government.",Q3
https://kste.iheart.com/content/2022-05-05-john-roberts-calls-leak-of-scotus-draft-opinion-absolutely-appalling/,John Roberts Calls Leak Of SCOTUS Draft Opinion 'Absolutely Appalling',"Chief Justice John Roberts spoke out about the unprecedented leak of a draft ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Roberts called the leak ""absolutely appalling"" while speaking to a group of judges and lawyers at the 11th Circuit Judicial Conference in Atlanta, Georgia, according to CNN.

It was his first public appearance since the ruling was published by Politico on Monday (May 2).

Roberts said it would be ""foolish"" to think that the leak would have any impact on the work of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice told the attendees that he hoped the leak would not harm ""people's perception"" of the Supreme Court.

The draft ruling, which was penned by Justice Samuel Alito, eviscerates the landmark 1973 opinion that legalized abortion, writing that it was ""egregiously wrong from the start.""

""The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,"" Alito wrote.

The case involves a Mississippi law that bans abortions in the state after 15 weeks. If the ruling remains unchanged, states would be free to outlaw abortion, though several have announced they plan to pass laws protecting a woman's right to have an abortion.

The Supreme Court is currently in recess. The Justices will meet again in a closed-door conference on May 12. The final ruling is expected to be released in July.",Q3

""Freedom for Olinza; set him free!"" rang throughout the downtown area as several supporters of Olinza Headd and his family protested the sentence that he was given after shooting and killing the man who he said molested his granddaughter.

But that's not all they were protesting. They were also protesting the fact that, according to them, pedophiles seem to have lighter sentences than they seemingly deserved.

""We're here because there needs to be better laws for pedophiles,"" one protester stated. ""Harder, stiffer laws. It's that simple. There's nothing complicated about it. What don't they understand about it? We need justice. Justice wasn't served in the first place, or we wouldn't be here. The justice system has failed.""

There is currently a petition that was created with Change.org, calling for signees to 'Free Olinza Headd.' Originally, the petition was asking for 200 signatures. It achieved those signatures, and is now asking for 500. As of this writing, there are currently 262 signatures.

Additionally, a GoFundMe has been created to help Valenta and the rest of Lin's family with attorney fees and other costs. It has currently raised $925 of an $80,000 goal.

Another protester stated that the the man who was shot by Headd was not a victim, but a criminal.

""Eugene, the quote unquote 'victim,' was previously convicted for child sex crimes, and he was slapped on the wrist and let out to reoffend,"" the protester said. ""And he reoffended on the wrong children. End of story.""

A search on the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation Sex Offender list using the accused's name yielded zero results, but Olinza Headd testified in court that Eugene Hogan III admitted to ""touching"" his granddaughter, which led to Headd fatally shooting the man three times.

Headd was arrested and initially charged with second-degree murder, but he took a plead deal and the charge was changed to manslaughter. Judge Daniel Forgey sentenced Headd to 17-to-20 years behind bars on April 21, 2022.

Now, Headd's wife is saying that his attorney ignored his requests.

""I'm trying to get the case out in the public so people can know the injustice of the justice system,"" Valenta Headd told K2 Radio News. ""My husband does not deserve 17-to-20 years. My husband, Olinza Headd, shot and killed a guy because, in fact, he was molesting our grandchildren. We found out it was more than just one.""

Valenta said that the child who was allegedly being touched told her sister, who then told adults. The sister, according to Valenta, is currently a patient at the Wyoming Behavioral Institute because of stress caused by the guilt of coming forward with the molestation allegations.

""She thinks it's her fault,"" Valenta said.

She stated that there were many miscarriages of justice involved with this case, including her husband's public defender, and the judge who presided over the case.

""I want Judge Forgey removed from the bench,"" she stated. ""I want the public defender, Marty Scott to be moved off of being a public defender. He never had time to talk to us. He told my husband [during] the first meeting that, here in Wyoming, that we could end up with 12 jurors, with all of them being white men that don't like black people.""

Valenta said that, per Scott's advisement, Headd took the plea deal but that he repeatedly asked Scott for a jury trial.

""I don't think that he was justified, or that he got a chance to say what he needed to say,"" Valenta said. ""I don't think that he was given a fair shot. I'm asking everyone to please call your governor, your Congressman, whoever that you think could help me and my husband. They moved him last night and didn't tell us where he was. So at this time, I don't even know where he is at.""

As Valenta shared her story, the group of protesters began walking past the Casper Police Department and headed south on Center Street, carrying a banner that said ""Penalties for the pedophiles, not the protector."" And that is what many Casper residents are calling Olinza Headd; a protector, a guardian, a hero.

That's certainly how Valenza sees him; her husband, the love her life. She views him as a hero, and she won't stop fighting until Olinza is free.

""He does not deserve this time,"" Valenta said. ""This is unjust. A pedophile will get lesser time. My husband is a man that loves children. He's a God-man. He's a minister. Anyone who knows him knows that he loves people. People love him. Please help me.""

Police said the teen was shot in the chest at about 7:30 p.m. Saturday near the giant, mirrored structure. Police didn't immediately release the teen's name.

He was taken to Lurie Children’s Hospital where he was pronounced dead, police said.

Officials announced Sunday afternoon that minors will not be allowed in the park after 6 p.m. Thursday through Sunday without an adult. Officials did not comment on how the curfew will be enforced.

Police also said that a 17-year-old was taken into custody after the shooting and a weapon was found on the teen. Charges are pending.

Another teen, who was allegedly armed with a ghost gun — a weapon that does not have a serial number and can’t be traced — was arrested in connection to the shooting, police said.

In total, 26 minors and five adults were arrested during the gathering in the park on Saturday evening. A total of eight guns were confiscated and five gun arrests were made, police said.

“This senseless loss of life is utterly unacceptable,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. “Tonight, a mother is grief-stricken, mourning the loss of her child and searching for answers.”

She said new measures will be taken “to help prevent events like this from happening in the future,” adding that details will be provided later. Her news release referred to young people coming to the downtown area, though it didn't elaborate.

“We must also have zero tolerance for young people carrying firearms or settling petty disputes with acts of violence,” the mayor's statement said. “We all must condemn this behavior in the strongest terms possible.”

Hundreds of people were at the park earlier Saturday as part of demonstrations around the U.S. against the recently leaked draft opinion that suggests the Supreme Court is prepared to overturn the nationwide right to abortion. It is unclear if the teen who was shot had taken part in the 1 p.m. demonstration, however participants had largely dispersed by late afternoon.

The shooting comes amid a surge in deadly violence in the city in recent years. This year, Chicago has recorded 779 shooting incidents and 194 homicides, compared to 898 shootings and 207 homicides during the same period in 2021, according to figures last updated by the Chicago Police Department on May 8.

Chicago and some other U.S. cities reported dramatic spikes in homicide totals last year. Chicago’s 797 homicides in 2021 — its highest toll for any year in a quarter century — eclipsed the totals in the two bigger U.S. cities, surpassing Los Angeles’ tally by 400 and New York's by nearly 300.

Pro-abortion protester Joseph Price screams at pro-life protestor Joe Green outside the Supreme Court on May 5, 2022 Jackson Elliott/The Epoch Times

WASHINGTON-Pro-abortion protesters outnumbered a lone pro-life protester near the Supreme Court by hundreds at one point on May 5 and briefly surrounded and screamed at the man.

By 5 p.m., the daily protest over a leaked Supreme Court opinion that could potentially undo Roe v. Wade had grown to about 200 people. Most present were young women, including some high schoolers.

One issue that got the most celebration from the crowd was vasectomies. One speaker said that men should get vasectomies. The crowd cheered wildly.

“When did you get your vasectomy?” Florida activist Kimberly Cox repeatedly asked pro-life protester Mark Lee Dickson. Cox attempted to follow Dickson and nag him by asking the same question dozens of times in a row.

“If I had a baby right now, I would die. And where would that leave my children?” she said.

“[Expletive] men,” one protester said.

The protest was primarily about the potential Supreme Court decision, but it often expanded to other issues that had little to do with Roe v. Wade. Speakers brought up transgenderism, the Equal Rights Amendment, and other issues.

The protest on Thursday was more organized than previous days, with printed signs reading “Gen-Z for Reproductive Rights” held by many of the protesters.

Protest leaders struggled to prevent angry outbursts and to keep protesters concentrated on chanting together and listening to speakers.

A few yards away from the main protest, pro-life protestor Joe Green sat on a bike. He was debating with some pro-abortion protesters.

“I started speaking up near the end regarding the eugenics and Margaret Sanger’s racism,” he said.

When the main group of protesters noticed that he was pro-life, a large wave of them went toward him with a shout.

Protest leaders attempted to pull them back.

Some followed, but a sizeable core remained.

As he attempted to debate, many of them screamed at him repeatedly and called him names.

“Why don’t you go the [expletive] away?” one screamed.

One protester argued that it’s better to abort kids than to have them grow up to live out destructive generational patterns.

“If you’re saying that you witnessed deficiencies in your raising, then as a parent you do better,” Green said.

Protesters shouted in response.

“You get the [expletive] out of here,” shouted Joseph Price, his face contorted with fury.

“You love democracy, right?” Green asked Price.

“No,” Price responded. “We love our rights!”

“We’re not just representing pro-choice, but our rights and the protection of our rights,” Price said, moments after he had stopped screaming at Green.

“I’m just like, trying to protect my own rights and the rights of, like, my friends,“ said Cameron Belair, another of the shouters.

As she talked, she gestured jerkily with her hands, pounding her fist against her palm.

“I had a pregnancy scare when I was 16 in high school, and I considered throwing myself down the stairs because I didn’t have the resources to abort,” Belair said.

Eventually, the crowd around Green left him alone.

“They’re Internet children. They’re suburbanites. They don’t know what they’re rooting for,” Green said.

Green added that he grew up in Washington and opposes abortion because he has seen the devastating impact of abortion on the city’s African American community.

“These people are rooting to make it easier to kill off those kids that were my friends,” he said.",Q3
https://www.41nbc.com/police-shooter-who-caused-texas-school-lockdown-in-custody/,"TX Gov. confirms 14 children, one teacher killed in school shooting - 41NBC News","UVALDE, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says 15 people were killed in a shooting Tuesday at an elementary school.

Abbott says the suspected shooter, an 18-year-old man, also died and was believed to be killed by responding officers.

He says 14 children and one teacher were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, about 85 miles west of San Antonio.

Abbott says the shooter had a handgun and possibly a rifle.

It was the deadliest school shooting in Texas history and occurred four years after a gunman fatally shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area.

Here’s Gov. Abbott’s statement:

“I want to tell you that what happened in Uvalde is a horrific tragedy that cannot be tolerated in the state of Texas and there is swift action being taken by local law enforcement as well as the Texas Department of Public Safety. They obviously now know who the shooter was – the shooter is no longer alive. Let me give you some details and then I’ll give you a summation about that. The shooter was Salvador Romos, an 18 year-old male who resided in Uvalde. It’s believed that he abandoned his vehicle then entered into the Robb Elementary School with a handgun and he may have also had a rifle that has not yet confirmed according to my most recent report. He shot and killed horrifically, incomprehensibly 14 students and killed a teacher. Mr. Ramos, the shooter he is ah he himself is deceased and it was believed that responding officers killed him. It appears that two responding officers were struck by rounds, but have no serious injuries. The Uvalde Independent School District Police Department is the investigating agency and we will provide them and the city of Uvalde substantial investigative patrol assistance. We’re in the process of obtaining detailed background information on the subject, his motives and the types of weapons used, the legal authority to possess, and conduct a comprehensive crime scene investigation and reconstruction and identify and interview all witnesses and provide victim services and other support as needed. Victor Escalon is the Texas Department of Public Safety South Texas Regional Director is on the scene and everything that can be done will be done. In addition to that, it has been reported that the subject shot his grandmother right before he went into the school. I have no further information about the connection between those two shootings. The subject is reported be a student at – to have been a student at Uvalde High School, and is a US citizen. Bottom line is this however, and that is – when parents drop their kids off to school, they have every expectation to know that they’re going to be able to pick their child up when that school day ends. And there are families who are in mourning right now and the state of Texas is in mourning with them for the reality that these parents are not going to be able to pick up their children.”

Malcolm Kenyatta running for U.S. Senate 'because the status quo will not save us',"After his parents split up, a young Malcolm Kenyatta walked into his home one day and complained to his mother about the trash littering their block in the new neighborhood where they had moved.

With his mother leaning over the stove to light a Newport cigarette, Kenyatta recalled her replying, “Boy, if you care so much why don’t you go do something about it?”

And so he did, running to become a junior block captain. From there, Kenyatta, the grandson of civil rights activist Muhammad Kenyatta, dove into community activism and politics, a journey that saw him become a featured speaker during the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

Now, years after that challenge from his mother, Kenyatta is a two-term Democratic state representative serving his Philadelphia district and is a U.S. Senate candidate in the Democratic primary. He’s also become a firebrand, progressive critic of legislative Republicans, taking to the House floor to verbally shred bills he finds particularly offensive.

“Literally everything I’ve done since has been with the whisper of that advice in my head,” Kenyatta, 31, said of his mother’s words. “You know, nobody is coming to save us.”

Instead, Kenyatta said that tough-love encouragement has spurred his commitment to poor and working families in Pennsylvania because he can identify with the struggle to pay the rent or mortgage, plan for a “dignified retirement,” or find affordable healthcare and childcare.

Those struggles, Kenyatta said, cross racial and geographical barriers, which is why he has taken his campaign to rural majority-Republican counties not used to having an openly gay, black Philadelphia Democrat working for primary votes there.

More:Philadelphia state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta says he's running for U.S. Senate in 2022

“I’m not running to be the first black senator, the first gay senator,” Kenyatta said. “My campaign has been about how do we restore the basic bargain to every single family, but I will be those things.”

The conventional wisdom that urban voters will automatically vote for him while rural voters won’t no longer applies, Kenyatta said. “We have to reject that, and I reject it,” he said.

“Working families, whether we all look alike, whether we all worship the same or choose not to, we’re all struggling with these same basic issues and challenges, and we’re all fighting for a government that actually will deliver for working people and for our families, and that’s why I’m in this,” he said. “Because the status quo will not save us.”

Caught in the crowd

Kenyatta is battling Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, both of Allegheny County, for the Democratic nomination, while Dr. Kevin Baumlin of Philadelphia and Jenkintown Councilwoman Alex Khalil round out the field.

A Franklin & Marshall College poll released in early March had Fetterman at 28% among Democrats and Lamb at 15% with Kenyatta a distant third at just 2%. There was still, however, a considerable portion of Democrats ― 44% — who remained undecided.

More recently, a poll by WETM/Emerson College Polling/The Hill in late March, found that Fetterman was leading with 33% followed by Lamb at 10%, making them the only two candidates to reach double-digit support. That survey put Kenyatta at 7.5%, behind Baumlin at 9% and ahead of Khalil at under 3%.

There was still a big portion of Democrats, 37%, who said they were undecided.

At the turn of the year, Kenyatta was far behind Fetterman and Lamb in fundraising. Fetterman raised nearly $12 million last year and had $5.3 million in available cash at the end of December, while Lamb raised $4 million and had $3 million in cash.

Kenyatta reported raising $1.5 million in 2021 and having just $285,000 in cash.

But Kenyatta insisted that he has built a strong coalition of unions, elected officials from across the state and voters who find similarities in his family’s hardships to their own, such as trying to figure out how to pay for insulin or buy a first home.

More:U.S. Senate candidate endorsed by Aliquippa mayor

“None of those things are unique, and that is the heartbreaking part of all this,” he said, “but what is unique is having a candidate who has had that life.”

A progressive platform

Kenyatta vowed to “take on” the pharmaceutical companies and fight for lower prices, work to counter a lack of investment in affordable housing and “unequivocally” oppose tax breaks for the wealthy that come at the expense of working families.

Ultimately, if he is elected in November, Kenyatta said the highest priority is to pass voting rights legislation.

“If people don’t have the right to engage in their democracy, everything else I’m talking about doesn’t really matter,” he said. “It really doesn’t.”

Job and small business growth will have a domino effect on issues such as education and crime, he said.

Kenyatta said he also wants to expand the Small Business Administration’s work as well as challenge banks’ lending practices in minority communities. He also wants to abolish the filibuster that stifles legislation in the Senate and pass a $15 per hour federal minimum wage.

President Joe Biden has done “a great job in a tough circumstance” when it comes to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Kenyatta. Pennsylvania has the nation’s second largest population of Ukrainian-Americans by population.

Not besties with Mitch

Kenyatta has frequently taken to the House floor to criticize Republican bills he opposes, often in emotional speeches bordering on firebrand sermons. He said that approach won’t change if he’s elected to the Senate.

“I will not be someone that (Senate Republican Leader) Mitch McConnell likes, and that’s OK,” he said with a laugh.

That passion will always be fueled by the life experiences that drive his career every day, Kenyatta said.

“Why is it always that when working people want something and need something and we ask for it, and we demand it, that we’re somehow stopping progress? No, we’re not the barrier to progress. Working people being asked to survive in the wealthiest nation in the world are not the problem,” he said. “Corporate greed and the fact that for so long and so often our government is completely focused on the well-off and well-connected, that is the damn problem.""

My own fluffy buddy, Jupiter Jack is a shelter cat, and I am a firm believer in the ""don't shop, adopt"" mindset. The rescue knew I was looking for a Main Coon mix and called me when they pulled him from a kill shelter. He was set to be put down that day at only 12 weeks old. That's him up above the day I brought him home and below is a photo of him now in all his floofy-glory. It's amazing what a little love can do.

Where to Adopt a Shelter Cat

So you want to take part in celebrating National Adopt a Cat Month? You're in luck! There are a number of shelters and rescues in the Evansville area with plenty of purring feline friends waiting for someone just like you.

SEE: 15 Animals You Cannot Own in Evansville I got the idea for this after seeing an article by Michelle Heart with our Townsquare Media sister-station, 107.9 Lite-FM in Boise, Idaho. She had discovered several animals residents in that city can't own based on city codes she found online which got me thinking about whether Evansville had any regulations that were similar. Obviously, they did or this article wouldn't exist. Chapter 14, Article 3, section 42 and 43 spell out a lengthy list of exotic animals you can get in trouble owning if local officials find out. You can see the entire list on the city's website . These are the 15 I found to be the most interesting.",Q3

America’s supposed racial divide has a class element that we are all supposed to ignore. But for the past two years, I couldn’t ignore the number of media outlets and supposed intellectuals who have discarded the legitimate concerns of the middle class because they, the elite, supposedly know what’s best for us and our children.

The anti-racism movement has come to Main Street, and no one asked for its arrival.

The average American isn’t very ideological because that is a luxury most Americans can’t afford when they’re trying to make ends meet and support their families, unlike the economic and intellectual elite. Men and women who have made their entire careers hypothesizing about the makeup of America never actually listen to Americans.

We recoil listening to their conception of American life for all races. Then the ideologues gaslight us, claiming we fight it because of our hatred of the truth rather than our disgust for radical elitists who find pleasure in telling us how to behave.

Anti-racists use race as a weapon for compliance and domination over the sensibilities of good people. Their intention is to hyper-racialize Americans by having you see all aspects of life through the prism of race — including education for your children. If you are white and choose to resist, you are labeled a white supremacist, and if you are black and resist, you are labeled a sympathetic character for a white-supremacist society. The only solution in their eyes is compliance, not dialogue.

When parents showed up to school-board meetings across the country because they don’t like this vision that has been imposed on their children, the anti-racists slandered them for resisting their new dogma. Critical race theory was also used to overshadow parental complaints about masking their children, inappropriate discussions of sex with their kids and gender ideology.

Take Ibram X. Kendi’s latest piece in The Atlantic, in which he claims the Republican Party is “the party of white supremacy.”

Understand, when anti-racists like Kendi write books and op-eds about their desire to deconstruct America’s white-supremacist social structures, they never discuss deconstructing the one social construct that allows racism to exist: race itself. It’s because “race” for them is a mechanism for power over guilt-riddled white Americans, control over the narrative and political leverage. In many ways, they’re our new cultural gatekeepers.

They are the ones who decide what we discuss and how we discuss it in the mainstream because many of our formerly sacred institutions are run by the elite who have bought into the anti-racist ideology. Elites find a favorable boutique framework of race in America palatable as it distracts from the effects of class privilege in favor of supposed racial privilege — and is always willing to accept money as a form of forgiveness.

America’s “racial reckoning” is being financed by the very people who benefit from there being a class division. If everything negative in our society is rooted in white supremacy, then class warfare will remain invisible and void of discussion.

They want you to believe the resistance from parents throughout America was an organized Republican mass hysteria fueled by white supremacy when much of it was an organic resistance against the credentialed class of ideological educators. It wasn’t an avoidance of uncomfortable American history surrounding race because we’ve always learned about these things in school. Discussing topics like slavery and Jim Crow is commonplace in American high schools.

This was a resistance to an exaggerated ideological framework that is foreign to the uncredentialed underclass. This was a guttural disgust at how the credentialed class, supported by the economic elites, used race essentialism to paint your average white American as inherently immoral and black Americans as victims of their immorality.

Individuality is a hate crime to these anti-racist collectivists. As such, me explaining my personal failures of economic strife and homelessness as not being the “white man’s doing” but a manifestation of my own bad decisions is still not enough to avoid being seen as a victim in their eyes or just another “black face of white supremacy.” They do not want black people to overcome like I was able to because there is more money in pitying black people.

For the Los Angeles installation, Porno for Pyros will join Starcrawler, Frankie and Witch Fingers and Perry Farrell's Kind Heaven Orchestra on July 7 at The Belasco in Los Angeles. The pre-sale starts tomorrow (June 2) from 10AM to 10PMPT followed by a general ticket on-sale Friday (June 3) at 10AM PT. Check here for ticketing info.

Farrell views Heaven After Dark as reviving the original spirit of Lollapalooza when it had more of a traveling carnival feel, mixed with some elements of Andy Warhol's Factory, with a mix of musicians, visual artists, street performers, comedians, DJs and surprise special guests. After the extraordinary results of the inaugural concert, working alongside Etty on this blossoming event series unified the art community. We reigniting the powers of curiosity, and expression through the use of visual and auditory art. The public craves truth ((Unified smirks),"" says Farrell.

Porno for Pyros, the alt-rock band fronted by Perry Farrell (Jane's Addiction), have announced their second reunion show of 2022, which will take place on July 30 at Metro in Chicago, Illinois as part of the Lollapalooza After Show series.

The group first reconvened in 2020 for an appearance at a virtual version of Lollapalooza and, at the Welcome to Rockville festival on May 22, they played their first live show in 26 years. The setlist featured a mix of songs off their only two records — 1993's Porno for Pyros and 1996's Good God's Urge — as well as a handful of Jane's Addiction covers.

The Rockville performance came by virtue of Jane's Addiction having to bow out as guitarist Dave Navarro has been battling long haul effects after contracting COVID in December. In a recent statement, he expressed confidence that he will recover in time, but remained uncertain as to when he can expect to return to full capacity.

Opening for Porno for Pyros at the upcoming reunion show will be Crawlers, an alt-indie group who released a self-titled EP last year and have issued two new singles — ""Fuck Me (I Didn't Know How to Say)"" and ""I Can't Drive"" — this year.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/30/european-union-flavored-heated-tobacco-ban/,E.U. proposes ban on flavored heated tobacco products as sales rise,"LONDON — The European Union is proposing to extinguish the use of flavored heated tobacco products across its 27 member states, in a bid to tackle cancer rates. Its executive arm, the European Commission, announced a proposal Wednesday to ban their sale in response to a “significant” increase in popularity across member states. Heated tobacco products have exceeded 2.5 percent of overall sales in the E.U., a report by the commission found.

The ban would cover only heated tobacco products — which work by heating processed tobacco leaf at a lower level than that of traditional cigarettes, letting smokers inhale nicotine — not electronic cigarettes that use flavored liquids containing nicotine derived from tobacco.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heated tobacco products are “harmful” and have not been proved to help smokers quit. Scientists are also still learning about their short- and long-term health effects, the CDC said, especially for young people.

The E.U. is working to create a “Tobacco Free Generation,” aiming to have less than 5 percent of the population using tobacco by 2040.

“With nine out of ten lung cancers caused by tobacco, we want to make smoking as unattractive as possible to protect the health of our citizens and save lives,” Stella Kyriakides, E.U. commissioner for health and food safety, said in a statement.

“Stronger actions to reduce tobacco consumption, stricter enforcement and keeping pace with new developments to address the endless flow of new products entering the market — particularly important to protect younger people — is key for this,” she added.

The ban would include components such as filters and capsules but not affect traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco or water pipes, according to the proposal.

In the United States this month, the Food and Drug Administration banned Juul Labs from selling its popular electronic cigarettes, citing insufficient data on health and safety. The Silicon Valley company was granted a delay on implementation of the ban while it appeals in federal court.

Public health advocates have long warned that a surge in vaping, particularly among young people, is cause for concern, arguing that the products rely on fun flavors and slick marketing campaigns but have not been proved as healthier alternatives to smoking.

Heated tobacco products were created in the 1980s but discontinued after they didn’t catch on. They experienced a rebirth in 2014, mostly in Japan, but their popularity has spread to Europe and the United States, with many tobacco companies now stocking a heated tobacco product, according to a study in the Lancet medical journal last year.

The most popular include IQOS, by Philip Morris International, and glo, by British American Tobacco, but the study found that “levels of use are low” in Europe and “more common among younger people.” It added that more data and independent research into the products was needed.

The World Health Organization has warned against their use, while the European Respiratory Society has also raised concerns, saying that although it is “tempting” to recommend that smokers switch from traditional cigarettes, the products are still “harmful and highly addictive.” The nonprofit added that there is “no evidence” that heated tobacco products are efficient smoking-cessation aids.",Q3

Wade decision that guaranteed women the right to terminate their pregnancies for the past 50 years.

Louisiana's ""trigger law"" that was updated and signed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards on June 21 ""shall become effective immediately upon ... any decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which overrules, in whole or in part, Roe v. Wade.""

All three of Louisiana's abortion clinics — Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Women's Health Care Center in New Orleans and Hope Medical Group in Shreveport — immediately stopped performing abortions Friday when the decision was announced.

Drug-induced abortions, which now account for about half of all abortions, are also illegal.

There are no legal exceptions for rape or incest, although there is an exception to save the life of the pregnant mother.

Louisiana law specifically exempts pregnant women from prosecution but provides maximum criminal penalties for doctors or others who terminate pregnancies of $200,000 fines and 15 years in jail for late-term abortions.

“I am and have always been unabashedly pro-life and opposed to abortion,"" Edwards said in a statement. ""However, I understand that people on both sides of this complex issue hold deeply personal beliefs, and I respect that not everyone, including many in my own party, agrees with my position.

""While we are still reviewing the decision issued by the court, Louisiana has had a trigger law in place since 2006 that would outlaw abortion, without exception for rape and incest, should the United States Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.""

More:Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signs abortion ban with no exceptions for rape, incest

Emergency contraception drugs like what are known as ""morning after pills"" remain legal.

""Louisiana is committed to protecting life and supporting moms,"" said Democratic Monroe Sen. Katrina Jackson, whose bill updated the state's 2006 abortion trigger law.

Jackson also previously authored the amendment declaring there is no right to and no funding of abortion in the Louisiana Constitution that 62% of voters approved in 2020.

But others, like Louisiana's only Democratic Congressman Troy Carter of New Orleans, considers the Supreme Court reversal a setback for women's healthcare and individual rights.

“Today the Supreme Court acted not to expand, but to take away the rights and freedoms of the American people for the first time in our nation’s history,"" Carter said. ""Today, six members of the Supreme Court have inserted themselves between patients and doctors. They have interrupted these private conversations with far-right legal principles that limit personal healthcare decisions like when to start a family.""

Louisiana's strict abortion trigger law update was attacked by the White House after it was passed by the Legislature.

The White House released the following statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre June 6.

""The Louisiana Legislature has taken the latest step in a growing attack against the fundamental freedoms of Americans,"" the statement said. ""Louisiana’s extreme bill will criminalize abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest and punish reproductive healthcare professionals with up to 10 years in prison.""

There are other abortion ban trigger laws in 13 other states, according to the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute, which means Louisiana women would have to travel as far as New Mexico and or Illinois to have an abortion.

Kentucky's and South Dakota's trigger laws also go into effect immediately, while the other 10 states' abortion bans begin after certification by state officials.

Louisiana's law does allow for the termination of ectopic pregnancies, which are where the fetus develops outside the uterus and can't survive, as well for removing a deceased baby from the womb or removing a child that can't live outside the womb.

In vitro fertilization remains legal in the state.

Ten people were shot and 13 others were injured after a man wearing a gas mask threw two smoke canisters and then opened fire aboard a subway car on the N train as it approached the 36th Street Station in Brooklyn during the morning rush hour, authorities said.

New York Police Chief of Detectives James W. Essig said at a news conference Tuesday night that Frank R. James, 62, rented a U-Haul van, the keys of which were found at the scene of the shooting in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood.

""We are looking for Frank James,"" he said. ""We know he rented that U-Haul van.""

James, who has addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia, was not named as a suspect, and detectives want to determine whether he witnessed the attack, Essig said. The van was rented in Philadelphia, he said.

Police said they were looking into social media posts from someone with the same name that mentioned homelessness, New York and Mayor Eric Adams, leading officials to beef up the mayor’s security detail.

The shooter set off two smoke canisters and opened fire with a Glock 9 mm handgun, shooting 33 rounds that struck the 10 gunshot victims, authorities said.

Investigators later recovered from the subway station a gun with a magazine attached, two additional magazines, ammunition, a hatchet and a container of what is believed to be gasoline, New York Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said at the news conference.

Any possible motive was unknown.

The attack triggered a massive law enforcement response, and a manhunt continued into Tuesday evening.

Police had said they were looking for a man believed to be about 5-foot-5 and 180 pounds, wearing a green construction vest during the attack.

“This person is dangerous,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said at a news conference Tuesday.

The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have joined in the investigation.

The chaos, which was caught on video and in photos, started at 8:24 a.m., Sewell told reporters.

“The suspect was in the train car. The shooting began in the train car,” she said. “As the train was pulling into the station, the subject put on a gas mask. He then opened a canister that was in his bag, and then the car began to fill with smoke. After that, he began shooting.”

None of the wounded have life-threatening injuries, and the attack isn’t being considered an act of terrorism, authorities said.

However, Adams said he considered the attack to have been an act intended to bring terror to subway riders.

""Any time you have a person that uses a smoke device, you have a person who discharges a weapon in the system, that appeared to place a gas mask on his face, that is a person that is intentionally trying terrorize our system,"" Adams told MSNBC.

Adams, a former police officer elected to office by voters with an increased fear of crime, said he would significantly boost police presence on the rails.

""What we're going to do to help ... ease some of the apprehension. We're going to double our enforcement,"" he said. ""We're keeping our day tour police officers to complement the 4-to-12 tour police officers.""

Senior law enforcement officials say a bag filled with fireworks was found at the scene of the Brooklyn subway shooting Tuesday. Obtained by NBC News

Before the U-Haul van was located on Kings Highway in Brooklyn early Tuesday evening, police said additional evidence, including a bag that contained additional smoke canisters and retail fireworks, was discovered at the subway station and could be connected to the attack, law enforcement sources told NBC New York.

The gun that was used jammed during the attack, possibly limiting injuries, the sources said.

Passengers, including some of the wounded, stumbled out of the train, with a few of them boarding an R train across the platform to get away, witnesses and law enforcement sources told NBC New York.

In addition to the 10 people who were shot, 13 others were hurt in the rush to get away from the N train, the New York City Fire Department said.

The injuries for the latter 13 were related to inhalation of canister smoke, tripping or falling while fleeing or panic attacks, Essig, the chief of detectives, said Tuesday night.

Investigators believe they have images of the gunman taken from nearby businesses — but a security camera in the station is broken, law enforcement sources told NBC New York.

Police explained at the evening news conference that the camera was nonfunctional as a result of user error, as someone had failed to switch frequencies, from UHF to VHF, or vice versa, so its images could be transmitted and stored.

Essig said hundreds of detectives were combing through other security video to determine whether it recorded images of the shooter.

Authorities also said no officers were at the 36th Street subway station when the shooting happened: They're not assigned there at all hours, but they are often there.

Scene was 'like a horror movie'

Commuter Kenneth Foote-Smith said the scene was “like a horror movie.”

He said he heard shots coming from a neighboring car as it filled with smoke. Adding to the panic, riders fleeing the smoke-filled car couldn’t get into his car for safety because of a jammed door, he said.

The train stopped just short of the station, presumably for a red light, leading to more panic.

“We can’t even see the faces of the people in the train car anymore,"" Foote-Smith told NBC New York.

""We luckily pull up to the station very shortly after that. And we all run out once the doors open, and it’s absolute bedlam. There’s people fleeing up the stairs. Luckily an R train pulled up. There’s people running into the R train.”

The fire department initially reported that several undetonated devices were found at the scene, but the police department said later that no ""active explosive devices"" were immediately found.

Several commuters posted images of bloodshed and smoke in the subway station immediately after the attack.

No train service; schools on lockdown

The station is a busy hub, and service was disrupted for hours.

Mobile phones across the five boroughs buzzed hours after the incident, telling New Yorkers to stay away from the Sunset Park neighborhood.

Several schools were put on lockdown, and most stores in the neighborhood evacuated.

National leaders offer prayers, assistance

President Joe Biden said his staff is in touch with New York City authorities and pledged federal help in bringing the gunman to justice.

""My wife, Jill, and I are praying for those who are injured and all those touched by that trauma,"" Biden said in Menlo, Iowa.

""And we’re grateful for all the first responders who jumped in action, including civilians, civilians who didn’t hesitate to help their fellow passengers and tried to shield them.""

Tuesday’s bloodshed comes as New York City companies and employees struggle with return-to-office debates and whether workers should be forced back to offices they’ve barely seen over the last two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Hochul said: ""This morning, ordinary New Yorkers woke up in anticipation of a relatively normal day. They left their homes, they went to school, they went to their jobs.

""That sense of tranquility and normalness was disrupted, brutally disrupted, by an individual so cold-hearted and depraved of heart that [he] had no caring about the individuals that they assaulted as they simply went about their daily lives.""",Q3
https://kfgo.com/2022/04/24/afghan-defence-minister-says-will-not-tolerate-invasions/,Afghan defence minister says will not tolerate ‘invasions’,"KABUL (Reuters) – Afghanistan’s acting defence minister said on Sunday that the Taliban administration would not tolerate “invasions” from its neighours after protesting against airstrikes it says were conducted by neighbouring Pakistan.

The comments come after the Taliban administration blamed Pakistan for airstrikes that officials say killed dozens in Kunar and Khost provinces.

Pakistan, which has not confirmed any involvement in airstrikes inside Afghanistan’s borders, said the two countries are “brotherly countries”.

“We are facing problems and challenges from both the world and our neighbors, the clear example is invasion by them in our territory in Kunar,” said Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, acting Afghan defence minister, at a ceremony in Kabul commemorating the anniversary of the death of his father, Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar.

“We can’t tolerate the invasion. We have tolerated that attack. We tolerated that because of national interests, next time we might not tolerate it,” he said.

Pakistan’s foreign office spokesperson said when asked for comment on Yaqoob’s comments that Pakistan hoped for longterm engagement with Afghanistan to secure peace.

“Pakistan and Afghanistan are brotherly countries. The governments and people of both countries regard terrorism as a serious threat and have suffered from this scourge for long time … therefore, it is important that our two countries engage in a meaningful manner through relevant institutional channels to cooperate in countering cross border terrorism and taking actions against terrorist groups on their soil,” the spokesperson said.

The Taliban administration’s foreign ministry last week called in Pakistan’s ambassador to protest against the strikes. Local officials said the strikes by Pakistan military helicopters killed 36 people.

The United Nation’s children’s agency head in Afghanistan said that 20 children were killed in airstrikes in Khost and Kunar on April 16.

Since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August, there have been numerous standoffs along the 2,600-km (1,615-mile) border with Pakistan – drawn by British colonial rulers and disputed by Kabul.

Increasingly frustrated by continuing militant attacks, Pakistan’s military has stepped up operations along the Afghan border in recent months.

https://dailycaller.com/2022/06/03/teachers-gender-ideology-transgender-nonbinary-schools-washington-post/,Teachers Explain How They Push ‘Gender Lessons’ On Young Children,"Teachers across the country revealed the strategies they use to teach young children about gender ideology in a Friday article published by The Washington Post.

Teachers discussed the various ways they are injecting gender-related discussions into their lessons, including comments about using hormones to stop menstrual periods and declining to state that sexual anatomy is gender-specific, according to The Washington Post. One transgender teacher makes a point of telling students about the process of gender transitions, including with personal testimony.

“LGBTQ identities are a naturally occurring facet of human variation, and that is why we need to learn about them in the context of biology and human anatomy,” Sam Long, a biology teacher at Denver South High School, told The Washington Post. Long, who is transgender, frequently discusses gender ideology with students, teaches that gender is a spectrum rather than a binary, and shares his own sex change experience.

In Florida and several others states, educators are restricted in teaching about gender identity, but elsewhere, teachers are embracing the topic as the number of transgender and gender nonbinary children rises. https://t.co/BtRzRPgPpP — Laura Meckler (@laurameckler) June 3, 2022

Bill Farmer, a science teacher in Evanston, Illinois, teaches students that gender is a social construct, not a biological reality, he told The Washington Post. There are currently more transgender and nonbinary students in his classes than ever before – at least one or two per class – and approximately half of his school’s biology teachers cover these subjects.

“There’s not many spaces where students have the opportunity to engage in these discussions in a more structured way and where there’s a safe space to ask questions,” he told The Washington Post. “Most students are testing out or trying to figure out where they fall in their gender identity.”

One Massachusetts kindergarten teacher gives children lessons on pronouns, including gender-neutral pronouns “they” and “ze,” and introduces them to concepts including trans identities and “gender queer,” he told The Washington Post. He doesn’t fully define the terms because it would be “too much” for kindergarteners.

“We don’t say a penis belongs to a man,” he told The Washington Post. He instead teaches that a penis belongs to a human, and that doctors sometimes get it wrong when determining a newborn baby’s gender.

Kara Haug, a sex-ed teacher in the Sacramento area, claimed she didn’t bring up gender identity in her classes but would simply answer students’ questions when they arose, she told The Washington Post. When one student asked her if she could stop her period if she felt like a boy, for example, she explained how hormones work.

Several states require that school curricula include LGBT topics, and multiple curriculum plans addressing transgender and gender ideology have come into use in schools, according to The Washington Post.(RELATED: San Francisco Joins List Of LGBT Pride Parades Banning Police From Attending Events)

One of these lessons, titled “Pink, Blue and Purple,” instructs teachers to ask first-graders how they know what gender they are and then explain that gender identity is a feeling and is not based on one’s body parts. It was developed by Advocates for Youth, a youth-oriented sexual health group.

Haug, Farmer, Long and Advocates for Youth did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

An American Airlines passenger is suing the company following a 17-day stint in jail after the airline wrongly identified him as a shoplifter who stole from a store in the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.

The lawsuit, filed in the judicial court of Tarrant County, Texas, claimed Michael Lowe was wrongfully detained in a New Mexico jail for over two weeks in “grossly unsanitary conditions” a year after the incident occurred. Lowe also claimed he was not told what the charges were until after he contacted a detective at the Dallas airport.

WATCH: THIS GROUP THINKS YOU SHOULD BOYCOTT AMERICAN AIRLINES

“I’ve never heard of this fact pattern in my life or my career,” Scott Palmer, Lowe’s attorney, told the Fort-Worth Star Telegram. “If it can happen to him, it can happen to anyone.”

The reported incident occurred in May 2020, when Lowe was on a layover in Dallas, awaiting his next flight to Reno, Nevada. Images in the lawsuit, obtained through security footage, showed discrepancies in the appearances of the two men. At the time, Lowe’s hair was two inches long, and he wore a mask, whereas the real shoplifter had a military-style buzzcut and did not wear a mask. Lowe argued that the differences in appearance should have dismissed him as a suspect.

The airport police department ordered American Airlines to send over the security footage and a list of passengers on the flight. However, the airline only sent the footage and Lowe’s name. As a result, the police issued two arrest warrants, one for felony burglary of a building and the second for criminal mischief. Lowe was arrested 14 months later at a Fourth of July bash in New Mexico.

“Finding composure in his knowledge this was a mistake,” the lawsuit said. “Mr. Lowe told his friends — who were only visiting New Mexico, and were not locals — not to worry, it would all get cleared up quickly. He was wrong.”

Lowe said he spent 17 days in the Quay County Jail, where he was in a constant state of fear of violence from other inmates. He also witnessed a young man get punched in the face three times and a different inmate who was clearly sick, according to the lawsuit.

After Lowe’s release, it took him two days to get back to Flagstaff, Arizona, where he was from. Lowe said he attempted to find out what the charges against him were but was only successful after calling the airport police department. The detective told him there was another warrant out for his arrest after he failed to show up to a court hearing.

The charges were dropped a few weeks later after Lowe retained Palmer, who asked the police to compare the photos of Lowe to the person who shoplifted.

Lowe is suing the company for civil damages, claiming negligence on the part of American Airlines. The lawsuit did not cite a specific amount of damages but requested a trial by jury. The lawsuit claimed Lowe has received a loss of income from his job as a travel guide at the Grand Canyon due to his emotional and traumatic experience at the New Mexico jail.

https://womensagenda.com.au/uncategorised/women-of-colour/jada-pinkett-smith-and-black-womens-hair-history-of-disrespect-leads-to-the-crown-act/,Jada Pinkett Smith and Black women’s hair,"When Black women are in legal and cultural battles for the right to wear their hair as they choose, jokes about our hair just aren’t funny, writes Cheryl Thompson, from Ryerson University, in this article republished from The Conversation.

The fallout from “the slap” at this year’s Oscars continues. Last week, Will Smith resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, after the academy issued a statement condemning Smith’s actions.

There have been innumerable media stories about “the slap,” including an episode of Don’t Call Me Resilient. “The joke,” however, has received less attention. “Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2 can’t wait to see you,” is what Rock said to Jada Pinkett Smith and the Oscar night audience before Smith got up and slapped him.

G.I. Jane is a 1997 fictional drama starring Demi Moore about the first woman to undergo training in the United States Navy Seals. Moore’s “feminine” character, Jane O’Neil, is chosen by a female politician attempting to make a point in her battle against the inherent sexism in the military. To “keep hanging,” O’Neil “divests herself of any trace of femininity” and shaves her head.

Although a shaven head for a woman should not signify anything but a style choice, Pinkett Smith’s shaven head is also due to alopecia. In 2021, she shared a video on Instagram explaining the disorder.

Regardless of the reasons for Pinkett Smith’s hairstyle, Rock’s joke was yet another jab at a Black woman’s hair. We Black women have learned to love our hair, despite a wider culture that has, historically, not accepted its diversity.

In fact, Black women have been fighting the court system for 40 years to get protection from hair discrimination.

Alopecia disproportionately affects Black women

In my 2019 book, Beauty in a Box I examined the dermatological research on hair loss. Two U.S. studies, from 2009 and 2017, found that central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is often underdiagnosed; some estimates report that 17 per cent of Black women have this condition.

Some of the reasons why Black women are more adversely affected by CCCA are due to tight braiding hairstyles, long-term use of hair weaves, lace-front wigs and chemical relaxers.

While Rock might not have known of Pinkett Smith’s alopecia, in his 2009 documentary Good Hair he spoke to Black women about their hair, especially about chemical relaxers.

Good Hair was a successful film for Rock, but that does not mean he grew from the project.

Black hair discrimination and the CROWN Act

Glamour’s September 2020 cover story was dedicated to six Black women who endured discrimination at work because of their hair. The feature explained how curly, “kinky” or big hair carries meaning for Black women.

For example, a messy topknot is considered chic on a white woman, while a Black woman with natural hair such as large Afro or locs would be considered unkempt and has led to workplace reprimand.

On March 18, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the CROWN Act, banning hair discrimination at private places of work, federal programs and public accommodations. CROWN stands for Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.

found that Black women were 80 per cent more likely to feel pressure to change their hairstyles to fit in at the office. Black women were also 83 per cent more likely to report being judged on her looks than other women.

The CROWN Act is not yet an official law. Despite President Joe Biden expressing strong support for the bill, there may not be enough votes to pass it.

Rogers vs. American Airlines

In 1981, American Airlines fired ticket agent Renee Rogers for wearing cornrows. She filed a discrimination suit challenging the airline’s policy prohibiting employees from wearing an all-braided hairstyle, claiming that such a policy violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and discriminated against her as a woman, and also as a Black person.

Legal scholar Paulette Cladwell explained how and why the U.S. Federal District Court of New York rejected Rogers’s claim that the style evoked her African heritage.

The court said her hairstyle was a result of having seen the 1979 film 10, starring Bo Derek who makes an appearance wearing long braids with beads at the ends. It became known as the “Bo Derek defence.” Rogers vs. American Airlines was a landmark case because it set a precedent that sanctioned the firing of Black women on the basis of their hair.

In 2016, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Catastrophe Management Solutions (CMS) for firing Chastity Jones, a Black woman, because she wore her hair in locs. The lawsuit shared much in common with Rogers vs. American Airlines. Lawyers for Jones also argued that her termination was in violation of the Civil Rights Act.

The court of appeals ruled that CMS’s “race-neutral grooming policy” was not discriminatory because while hairstyles are “culturally associated with race” they are “not immutable physical characteristics.” The court ruled that a hairstyle might be closely associated with one’s culture but because it is changeable, it is not protectable under the law and an employer is within its rights to use it as a reason to deny employment.

Hair has also come up in discussions on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings because the legal profession has often discouraged natural hairdos. In 2007, an editor from Glamour in a “do’s and don’ts” fashion event at a New York law firm called locs “truly dreadful.”

Why Black hair jokes aren’t funny

When Black women are in legal and cultural battles for the right to wear their hair as they choose, jokes about our hair just aren’t funny. The straight hair standard of beauty has been called toxic not only to Black women but women in general for the ways it valorizes white, western beauty ideals.

One may argue that public figures should be open to criticism. For example, United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson often shows up with his hair in disarray which gets poked fun at by media. The difference is that there is no threat to his livelihood.

Until Black women can wear their hair how they want without risk of ridicule, reprimand or termination, a joke targeting Black hair is no laughing matter.

Former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, an investigator hired by Republicans to look into former President Donald Trump's 2020 loss in the battleground state, who refused to answer questions from Circuit Court Judge Frank Remington, leaves the stand, Friday, June 10, 2022, at the Dane County Courthouse in Madison, Wis. Gableman was found in contempt after he berated the judge and refused to answer any questions on the witness stand. (Amber Arnold/Wisconsin State Journal via AP)

Original Publication Date June 15, 2022 - 9:51 AM

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A judge on Wednesday issued a scathing ruling against the investigator hired by Republicans to look into the 2020 election in Wisconsin, accusing him of unprofessional and misogynistic conduct, forwarding his decision for possible disciplinary action against Michael Gableman.

Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington ordered that Gableman be fined $2,000 a day until he complies with his earlier ruling. He also determined that Gableman violated his oath as an attorney following his “disruptive and disrespectful” appearance in court last week. At that hearing, Remington found a defiant Gableman to be in contempt after he refused to answer questions under subpoena in the courtroom. His attorneys tried unsuccessfully to block the subpoena.

“Wisconsin demands more from its attorneys,” Remginton wrote. “Gableman’s demeaning conduct has discredited the profession and every other person sworn ’to commit themselves to live by the constitutional processes of our system.”

The order comes in an open records lawsuit filed by liberal government watchdog group American Oversight. It is one of three open records lawsuits the group filed against Gableman, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and the state Assembly. The group has won a series of victories before Remington and another Dane County judge after Gableman and Vos failed to produce the requested records in a timely manner.

Gableman's attorneys did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the judge's order.

Remington chided Gableman for what he called his “unprofessional conduct” and for launching into “an irrelevant diatribe” at last week's hearing. Remington forwarded the order to the office that hands down disciplinary actions against attorneys and judges in Wisconsin. Gableman could face additional sanctions that include suspension or revocation of his license to practice law.

His order cites comments Gableman made that were captured by the microphone while the court was in recess where he made sarcastic comments about the judge and the ability of American Oversight's attorney Christa Westerberg to do her job without the help of the judge.

“Why don’t you come right up to the bench, Ms. Westerberg?” Gableman said at the hearing as quoted in the ruling, impersonating the judge. “Why – why don’t you come back into my chambers so you can dictate.”

Remington said Gableman’s behavior was misogynistic and an “affront to the judicial process and an insult” to Westerberg.

“The sophomoric innuendo about Atty. Westerberg coming back to chambers is a sad reminder that in 2022, woman lawyers still have to do more than be excellent at their job,” the judge said.

Westerberg did not immediately return a message seeking comment. American Oversight attorney Dan Schwager praised the ruling in a statement, saying he hoped it would compel Gableman to comply with the order and release all of the requested records.

Gableman, during his testimony, said he would not be “railroaded” and accused the judge of advocating against him. Remington, in his order, said he would ignore the comment, but he referenced the killing earlier this month of a retired Wisconsin judge.

“Unfortunately, the Court has observed firsthand the effect of Gableman’s unfounded accusation that I am biased and that I am an advocate for American Oversight,” Remington wrote. “I have been made aware of threats, for example, that I had ‘better watch my back,’ or ‘I hope the judge has a gun.’ One online suggestion has been for a group to protest at my home as has been reported at the home of United States Supreme Court Justice Kavanagh.”

Gableman was hired a year ago by Vos, under pressure from Donald Trump to investigate the former president’s loss to President Joe Biden by just under 21,000 votes in Wisconsin. The investigation has cost taxpayers about $900,000 so far. Biden’s victory has survived two recounts, multiple lawsuits, a nonpartisan audit and a review by a conservative law firm.

Gableman has issued two interim reports, but his work has faced a barrage of bipartisan criticism. Vos put his work on hold this spring pending the outcome of lawsuits challenging his ability to subpoena elected officials and others who worked on elections.

Remington said Gableman intended to use his appearance in court to distract from his office's failure to comply with past court orders to supply records requested by American Oversight.

“The transcript of these events does not tell the whole story,” Remington said. “It does not show Gableman’s raised voice, his accusatory tone and his twisted facial expression. It does not show that as he spoke, he pointed and shook his finger at the judge. ... This strategy might work elsewhere, but it has no place in a courtroom.""",Q3

Sonia Hermosillo gave a tearful plea to Orange County Superior Court Judge Kimberly Menninger to be granted probation. Hermosillo pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but jurors rejected that and convicted her Aug. 11 of murder and child assault causing death.

""I truly regret what I did,"" Hermosillo said through a translator. ""I am asking for an opportunity… I want to be with my daughters. I plead with you, your honor. I know what I did was wrong and regret doing it from the bottom of my heart. If you could just give me an opportunity please.""

Menninger said Hermosillo's son, Noe Medina Jr., was an especially vulnerable victim.

Menninger also noted how Hermosillo's husband had taken steps to protect their son, but that the defendant took advantage of a short moment when he was showering to take the baby to the hospital.

""She left a note of apology and escaped the house with baby Noe,"" Menninger said. ""Baby Noe had no way to protect himself.""

Menninger also said the assault included planning.

""She waited till she got that tiny opportunity … to successfully complete the murder,"" Menninger said.

Hermosillo may have suffered from a delusion that her son, who was born with flat-head and twisted-neck syndrome, would never grow up, but the judge said the infant was expected to ""be perfectly normal."" Menninger noted that Hermosillo removed the baby's helmet before hurling him to his death.

The defendant's daughter, Johana Hermosillo, tearfully told the judge that her mother was loving and caring to her before the birth of Noe ""changed her."" She said she misses her mother, who calls her twice a week from the Orange County Jail to check up on her.

""It's very hard to see her this way,"" Johana Hermosillo said. ""I think about her every day.""

She also remembered how the whole family ""loved and cared"" for Noe.

""She was never the same after that happened,"" Johana Hermosillo said of her brother's birth. ""I just want my mom back.""

Hermosillo's attorney, Jacqueline Goodman, said the baby's father has continued to support her and ""understands she was sick.""

Goodman told the judge, ""I wish we could get to a day where we meet hurt with healing rather than blame… She's a victim in this case. The real victim is Ms. Hermosillo and her husband who lost his only son, and the daughters who lost their baby brother. Not one of them who loves this baby doesn't blame Ms. Hermosillo.""

Menninger rejected Goodman's motion for a new trial based on a claim that the court interpreter had to handle translations -- sometimes form multiple people at once -- during the trial.

Hermosillo was convicted of first-degree murder and child assault causing death. Jurors in September determined she was sane at the time of the crime.

The defendant made incriminating statements to police following the Aug. 22, 2011, death of her son, Deputy District Attorney Mena Guirguis said.

Hermosillo told police, ""No, I would rather he died,"" and said she killed him ""because he's sick,"" and ""that's why I don't love him,"" according to Guirguis.

Experts for the defense testified during the sanity phase that Hermosillo suffered from post-partum psychosis, while experts for the prosecution said she was depressed. One expert determined Hermosillo had bipolar-type schizo-affective disorder, according to the defense.

Hermosillo was given credit for 3,909 days in custody awaiting trial.",Q3

Police charged Gage Michael Smith, 20, of New Castle, with firing several shots from a moving vehicle, striking multiple vehicles, at approximately 4:20 p.m. April 28, at the 600 block of 13th Street.

Police determined no person was shot during the incident.

A criminal complaint detailing more information was written by Beaver Falls Det. Stephen Ivan. Ivan said two vehicles were involved, with police later locating empty shell casings in the street in the area of 6th Avenue and 13th Street.

Two individuals, who the Times will not identify, said one of the individual’s child was fired at.

Witnesses in the area said they saw a white vehicle pull behind a black SUV, with a person in the white vehicle firing out the window at the SUV. The person in the SUV said the white vehicle pulled up next to their car, with the front passenger showing a handgun.

The person driving the white vehicle then chased the SUV, the complaint alleges, with the front passenger eventually firing shots.

Police later discovered five bullet projectiles struck the vehicle, and also discovered the white vehicle in question, a Chevrolet Malibu. The person in the SUV later identified Smith as the person who reportedly fired the shots.

Smith is charged with attempted criminal homicide, aggravated assault, carrying a firearm without a license, propulsion of missiles into an occupied vehicle, reckless endangerment and simple assault.

A felony arrest warrant has been issued for Smith. The department is actively seeking to locate him and a white 2005 Chevrolet Malibu, bearing Pennsylvania registration LWY-5553.

“Citizens are requested not to approach or attempt to apprehend Smith, and to notify local law enforcement if his whereabouts are known,” said Beaver Falls Chief of Police David Johnson. “This is an active investigation, and no further information is available for release currently.”

The Beaver Falls Police Department non-emergency line is 724-775-0880.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/12/fentanyl-overdose-deaths-dc/,Police say 10 people died in fatal fentanyl overdoses in Northeast D.C.,"Ten people in two neighborhoods in Northeast Washington have now died from a lethal batch of fentanyl, police said Tuesday, the second mass-casualty incident involving the deadly opioid in the District this year. Police said at least 17 people overdosed on cocaine laced with fentanyl in Trinidad and Ivy City from Saturday morning through Monday evening, and seven of them survived.

In January, nine people died after taking a similar concoction in a neighborhood near Nationals Park. Authorities arrested two people in that case and said they do not believe the most recent incidents are connected to the earlier overdoses.

This week teams of health workers fanned across Trinidad and Ivy City to help people struggling with addiction, while police teamed up with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to identify suppliers.

“We know we have a bad batch of drugs that are here in our community,” Christopher Geldart, the deputy mayor for public safety and justice, said at a news conference on Tuesday. He said officials need to find the source of the drugs “and stem that flow.”

The names of the people who died have not yet been made public, pending notification of relatives. Officials said they ranged in age from mid-30s to about 60, and came from diverse backgrounds. Some were homeless.

Police said the deaths occurred over three days in two neighborhoods, making it initially difficult to conclude the victims had likely used drugs from the same or similar batch. Some people overdosed inside residences. Police said they are interviewing survivors and reviewing surveillance video as part of their investigation.

Opioid deaths in the District nearly doubled from 2018 to 2021, according to statistics from the city. The D.C. medical examiner has identified fentanyl in more than 90 percent of the overdose deaths in 2020 and through March 2021. Statistics for a comparative period this year were not yet available.

At Tuesday’s news conference, held at a fire station in Trinidad, police and health officials urged residents to look out for one another. Officials also promoted the use of naloxone, a nasal spray that can quickly revive a person who is overdosing.

All first responders in the District carry the antidote. Police said officers have administered about 1,900 doses since March of 2019. The city has also distributed 58,800 naloxone kits, which are available at locations throughout the District and by texting “livelongDC” to 888-811. Officials also have test strips available so people can check their drugs for the presence of fentanyl.

D.C. police say that at least one person a day in the District dies of an opioid-related overdose, but rarely are they confronted with two events with so many deaths so close together.

After the nine people died in January along the Southwest waterfront, police and the DEA arrested two people whom they charged with federal drug distribution and conspiracy counts, alleging they knew they had a deadly batch of drugs and sold them anyway at Half and O streets.

At the time, D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee III called fentanyl a “poison that is being peddled in our community.” The victims in the January cases ranged in age from 43 to 74, and five were women.

On Tuesday, Assistant D.C. Police Chief Morgan C. Kane said the same detectives and agents who investigated the overdose deaths in January near Nationals Park have been assigned to the Ivy City and Trinidad cases.

She described the area around Meigs Place and West Virginia Avenue in Northeast Washington as “ground zero.” Trinidad and Ivy City are in a wedge-shaped area along and near New York Avenue and Gallaudet University. Kane reminded residents that officers are not interested in arresting addicts, and she noted laws designed to protect them from being detained when they call seeking help.",Q3
https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/cruise-robotaxis-blocked-traffic-for-hours-on-this-san-francisco-street/,"Cruise robotaxis stop operating, block traffic on San Francisco street","More than a half dozen Cruise robotaxis stopped operating and sat in a street in San Francisco late Tuesday night, blocking traffic for a couple of hours until employees arrived and manually moved the autonomous vehicles.

Photos and a description of the Cruise robotaxi blockade were shared to a Reddit post on a subreddit about happenings in the city.

The cars appear to have been stalled at the intersection of Gough and Fulton Streets.

“We had an issue earlier this week that caused some of our vehicles to cluster together,” a Cruise spokesperson said. “While it was resolved and no passengers were impacted, we apologize to anyone who was inconvenienced.”

The vehicles were recovered through a combination of remote assistance and manual retrieval.

The mishap comes less than a week after Cruise launched its first fully driverless, commercial robotaxi service in the city. Cruise’s vehicles are initially operating between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. on designated streets and without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The Reddit post subsequently made the rounds on Twitter.

“The first thing I say to my co-worker is that they’re getting together to murder us,” wrote the OP. “It was a pretty surreal event. Humans had to come and manually take the cars away. Cruise should get fined to shit for blocking the street off for so long. They even made it so the street sweeper couldn’t hit an entire block.”

Fines for blocking the street sweeper are around $76 per car in San Francisco. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority (SFMTA) did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for more information about how it handles such situations with autonomous vehicles and whether Cruise will receive any fines for blocking the intersection.

The issue calls into question the policy cities need to build around autonomous vehicles when they break the law, as well as Cruise’s own operational protocol for these types of incidents.

In April, a Cruise car was pulled over by a police officer because its headlights had malfunctioned. An Instagram video of the event shows the car pulling over when signaled to do so, but when the cop tried to open the driver-side door, the vehicle drove off and then pulled over a little way down the road and activated its hazards. The cop then approached the vehicle again. No citation was issued.",Q3

Now, those residents will need to find other housing by June 30.

Around 50 people gathered at the Coleman A. Young Building in Downtown Detroit to protest alongside the Detroit Eviction Defense. Some of the protesters entered the building, calling on the city to help find housing for these residents.

Jai Kaiser was evicted in May with her child.

""We don’t want apologies, we want action, we want help. We want affordable housing. What’s affordable? Not $1,400 when I make $500 a month,"" she said.

Kaiser and others living in hotels say though many of the rooms don’t have kitchens, it’s better than being out on the street.

They don’t know where they’ll end up when they are once again evicted from their home.

Detroit Eviction Defense organizers want the city to hire more counselors to assist these tenants as they search for homes. And they want the city to continue to pay for the hotels until everyone finds a home they can afford.

Joe McGuire is an attorney and organizer with the Detroit Eviction Defense.

""We know for a fact that once someone is made homeless, even for a brief period, it is much, much harder for them to bounce back from that,"" he said.

Following an eviction, 276 families have lived in hotels in metro Detroit with federal American Rescue Plan Act funding that was given to the City of Detroit, said Dan Austin, spokesman for the Detroit Planning, Housing & Development departments.

As of Tuesday's protest, 88 families are still living in the hotels. Several tenants were told that they needed to be out of their homes at the hotel by June 1.

Austin says 40 of the tenants will be able to stay until June 30 when the federal aid ends.

Laqunna Smith is living in a hotel with her 3-year-old son following an eviction. She's working and trying to save, but even the $25 application fees that many apartments charge to background check her, are a financial strain for the single mother.

After a neighbor fatally shot her son in 2001, Dr. Dorothy Johnson-Speight started the anti-violence group Mothers in Charge. “I thought maybe two people would show up; the room was jam packed.”

Homicide is the leading cause of death for Black males aged 44 and younger in America, and many of these deaths are the result of gun violence. In Philadelphia, where hundreds of people are shot each year, and most are Black males, Mothers in Charge (MIC) supports women and families who have lost loved ones to violence. Members and staff of the organization appeared in “Heaven: Can You Hear Me?” a short documentary about grief and recovery that aired on the World Channel and PBS in February.

Four mothers featured in the film told their heartbreaking stories to The Marshall Project. In Part 1 of our series, we hear from Dr. Dorothy Johnson-Speight, a licensed family therapist and the founder of Mothers in Charge. Her son, Khaaliq Jabbar Johnson, was killed in 2001 at age 24.

Gun violence is more prevalent in Philadelphia than when I was growing up in the 1960s. Back then, there were gangs that would occasionally fight. There would be a stabbing, or someone would snatch an antenna off of a car and use it, but there wasn’t the degree of guns that you see now.

By the time I was raising Khaaliq in the ‘90s, guns were becoming more of a problem. There was an incident when Khaaliq and his school buddies were accosted and robbed at gunpoint at a city bus stop. Khaaliq was destroyed by that. He came home and punched the wall out of anger.

One Halloween, Khaaliq’s best friend decided to egg a woman’s car. Well, the woman came out of her house and fatally shot him. Khaaliq, who was 17 years old at the time, was devastated. This was the first time he had lost a close friend to violence.

Back then, I knew those most at risk of gun violence in Philadelphia were Black boys and men between the ages of 14 and 24. I kept praying that my son would not become a statistic. I thought that if he just made it past 24, he’d be fine.

Khaaliq went to college and earned his bachelor’s degree. He did social work, and he was very good at understanding the mental-health and behavioral needs of young children. We even decided to get our master’s degrees together and “hang a shingle.”

Khaaliq turned 24 in June 2001. In December, a neighbor shot him seven times over a parking dispute. So, he too, became a statistic in our community.

A couple of months after Khaaliq’s death, I was watching the news and I saw this woman asking for help identifying the person who killed her son that past summer — about half a year before my son was killed. I felt a connection with her because her son was murdered not far from where Khaaliq died. She said there was a person running from the scene, a Black man that owned pit bulls. That sounded familiar to me, so I went to the block where she lived and started knocking on doors trying to find her.

We sat at her dining room table for about an hour comparing notes about our sons’ murders. That’s when we realized that the person who shot and killed my son over a parking space in December had stabbed her son to death about five months earlier. This is what violence does if left unaddressed: It spreads and harms many different people. This is why it’s a public health crisis.

Going through the court system made grief something that happened in starts and fits. I had to go to court, then wait for a trial date and wait for a verdict — a process that took nearly two years. I kept waiting for this justice that would make me all better.

I did feel a sense of relief when the man who killed our sons was found guilty and sentenced to two life sentences. Little did I know that conviction wasn’t bringing Khaaliq back. I would still be on a journey of insurmountable grief for a very, very long time. I still couldn’t go on with my life because my son wasn’t there. The pain remained in my heart, my stomach, and everywhere in my body.

I had experience with grief and pain: Before Khaaliq was killed, I lost my mom, my dad, my only sibling, and a daughter to an illness. But none of that compared to his death. Murder complicates the mourning process.

A couple of years after Khaaliq’s murder, I started Mothers in Charge. It began casually, with me and other people who had lost loved ones to violence, meeting in a Denny’s to discuss what we wanted to do about the issue. Then we moved to a small all-purpose room in a local church. Eventually we had our first formal meeting. I thought two people would show up; the room was jam packed.

That was nearly 20 years ago. I’ve spent a lot of time over these years listening to everyone else’s pain, and sometimes it starts to weigh on me. I’ll step away for a minute and practice self-care: get a massage, go on vacation, or take myself shopping. A lot of my friends have gone through the same type of loss, so we can support each other in moments like this.

Along with my grief, I’m scared to death of losing another child to gun violence. One of my grandsons is named after Khaaliq, and he’s about to turn 12. In early March, Philadelphia police officers shot and killed a boy his age. That is one of my biggest fears, and the fear of every mother in this city who has a son or daughter that young.

In order to address the type of interpersonal gun violence that killed my son, there needs to be more prevention work. I think community members play a big role in this. This is our problem. The police are not going to solve it, and the politicians aren’t going to solve it. We need the community to invest in and make a change on this issue.

Special for The Gardner News

According to Wikipedia, the military classification of Missing in Action (MIA) is “a casualty classification assigned to combatants, military chaplains, combat medics, and prisoners of war who are reported missing during wartime or ceasefire.

“They may have been killed, wounded, captured, executed, or deserted. If deceased, neither their remains nor grave has been positively identified.”

During World War II, a total of 78,750 personnel of the United States Armed Forces were reported missing in action by the end of the war, representing more than 19 percent of the total of 405,399 killed during the conflict.

A total of 18 Gardner soldiers received the MIA designation, including Elden W. Bjurling, Leon E. Chabot, Nathaniel S. Clifford, Donald V. Foster, Berton E. Gray, Anthony P. Hajkowski, Wacy Kacian, J.E. Roger LeBlanc, Joseph L.A. LeBlanc, Lawrence L. Lukasevicius, Francis H. Moore, Harold A. Morrissey, Harry H. Musinski, Halsey S. Nisula, Edward Pilkovsky, Robert M. Rocktaschel, Harry J. Ryan and Frederick W. Shippee.

This is the continuation of the series Remembering Local World War II Heroes.

2nd Lt. Frederick W. Shippee Jr. (1920-1945)

Frederick W. Shippee Jr. was born in Gardner on Nov. 23 1920, the son of Frederick W. Sr. and Edith (Walker) Shippee. Because he shared the same first name as his father, the family called him “Ted” so as to not confuse the two as he got older. His father was a foreman at Collier-Keyworth and the family lived at 96 Chestnut St. with brother Alvin and sister Clara.

He was an honor roll student at Gardner High School, graduating with the Class of 1938 and was on the swim team, school orchestra, and was business manager of the Argus. After high school, he attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute where he majored in mechanical drawing and was co-captain of the swimming team, as well as the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.

Following his 1942 graduation from college, he took a job with Proctor & Gamble. He entered the military service on Oct. 14, 1942, at Boston and went on active duty at Boca Raton, Fla., on March 17, 1943. He was commissioned a second lieutenant at Yale University.

On Oct. 14, 1944, he married the former Mary Elizabeth Thomas, with the ceremony held at Yale University. Following the wedding, they resided on Grove Street in Worcester.

Shippee went on to attend flight engineering school at the Boeing aircraft pant in Seattle, Wash., becoming a technical officer in aircraft maintenance engineering. He later received his wings and rating as flight engineer at Lowry Field in Denver, Colo., on March 27, 1944.

After eight months, he left for the Pacific theater as a flight engineer of a B-29 Superfortress tabbed “Million Dollar Baby” on Nov. 15, 1944, and was based on Saipan in the Mariana Islands. He went on to take part in the air offensive over Japan as a member of the 883rd Bombardment Squadron, 500th Bombardment Group B, and had completed four combat missions.

On Jan. 3, 1945, around 5:40 in the evening, Lt. Shippee’s plane ran across hostile aircraft over Sofugan in the Izu Islands and the bomber sustained damage. As the bomber disappeared into the night, Shippee radioed in where he felt it would be landing in the water.

Reportedly, the plane was forced down by enemy flak while returning from its combat mission to Nagoya, Japan. The survivors were said to have been seen in two life rafts, and supplies were dropped to them while an American submarine was directed to the area.

Upon its arrival the following morning, no trace of the rafts or occupants were found.

There had been heavy weather during the night, as well as Japanese surface craft in the area. The 24-year-old Shippee was presumed dead on Jan. 4, 1946.

He would be awarded the Purple Heart, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Ribbon with one battle star, American Theater Ribbon, World War II Victory Medal and the Air Corps Citation of Honor.

While his remains were never found, there is a stone in his memory in the family lot in Green Bower Cemetery in South Gardner.

Cpl. John Sieminski (1923-1944)

John Sieminski was born in Gardner on Sept. 10, 1923, the son of Wladislaw and Helen (Milko) Sieminski. Two days after his birth, his mother died of a brief illness. This left her husband, Walter, quite overwhelmed with five children, including a newborn, at their 17 Baker St. house.

Initially, young John was going to be sent away to be cared for by nuns, as his father was unable to take care of him as well as the other son, Waclaw, and three daughters, Helen, Jennie and Rose. However, his aunt was against the idea and took him into her home in Winchendon.

As he grew up, John attended Winchendon schools. However, when his aunt became ill, his father decided that he should return to Gardner to live with his family. The aunt did not want them to take John and actually won a court battle to keep him. The court decided to let him remain with the woman who raised him.

Sieminski later moved to Otter River with his uncle, Nikodem Wojtukiewicz, and was employed by the Greenwood-Carlton Corp. in South Gardner.

He entered the Marine Corps at Boston on Aug. 10, 1942, and was assigned to Camp Lejeune, S.C., for boot camp training. He was later stationed at Parris Island, S.C., and sent overseas to join the 4th Marine Division in the Pacific in June of 1944, taking part in the Saipan campaign in the Mariana Islands.

On July 24, the 4th Marine Division arrived at Tinian (also in the Marianas) from Saipan in an attempt to take land from the Japanese because of the extra-long runways available for aircraft landings. The Marines were firmly established there by the time the enemy planned a counterattack. On the first night, the Japanese lost more than 1,200 men.

While in action on Tinian with Company A, 23rd Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Sieminski was killed on Aug. 2, 1944. He was one month shy of his 21st birthday.

Sieminski was awarded the Bronze Star posthumously, the award reading, “When Japanese troops attacked his squad leader and another rifleman whose objective was to search out an enemy cave, Corporal Sieminski, given the mission of covering their advance, boldly exposed himself to counter the enemy fire and cover the withdrawal of his companions, carrying on until he was mortally wounded.”

His other decorations included the Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation, Marine Corps Citation, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Ribbon with two battle stars, American Theater Ribbon and World War II Victory Medal.

He was buried in St. John’s Cemetery in Gardner next to the mother he never knew.

https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/apr/01/storms-hit-south-kill-at-least-2-people/,"Storms hit South, kill at least 2 people","A line of severe storms packing isolated tornadoes and high winds ripped across the Deep South overnight -- killing at least two people in the Florida Panhandle, toppling trees and power lines and leaving homes and businesses damaged as the vast weather front raced across several states.

In Florida, the Washington County sheriff's office said Thursday morning that two were killed and two injured when a tornado touched down in the western Florida Panhandle.

Two homes were destroyed and powerlines were knocked down, according to Washington Country Emergency Management spokeswoman Cheryl Frankenfield. The county's Facebook page showed at least one home that was obliterated, as well as trees down on another home.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management has employees in the area to help, spokesperson Samantha Bequer said. She said neighboring Jackson County also had property damage.

""It's a nasty day, but thankfully these storms are moving quickly,"" she said.

At least two confirmed tornadoes injured several people Wednesday, damaged homes and businesses and downed power lines in Mississippi and Tennessee after an earlier storm caused damage in Arkansas, Missouri and Texas.

About 185,000 customers were without electricity Thursday morning in the wake of the storm along a band of states: Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utilities.

The worst of the weather Thursday morning appeared to be at the southern end of the storm front, which was expected to bring heavy rain and high winds all along the U.S. East Coast later in the day. Much of the Florida Panhandle was under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.

Widespread damage was reported in the Jackson, Tenn., area as a tornado warning was in effect. ""Significant damage"" occurred to a nursing home near Jackson-Madison County General Hospital and the Madison County sheriff's office in Jackson, said Madison County Emergency Management Director Jason Moore.

In Nashville, Tennessee, paneling fell five stories from the side of a downtown hotel Wednesday evening and onto the roof of a building below. The fire department warned that debris could become airborne as high winds continued, and some hotel guests were moved to other parts of the building due to concerns the roof would become unstable. No injuries were immediately associated with the collapse.

Daylight revealed widespread wind damage across Alabama.

One person suffered minor injuries when a storm hit the University of Montevallo campus south of Birmingham, damaging three buildings, officials said, and a woman was injured when a manufactured home rolled over in rural Bibb County. A school bus was flipped at a high school in south Alabama, and part of the roof was missing from a church in northwest Alabama.

Elsewhere, a warehouse roof collapsed as the storms moved through Southaven, Miss., near Memphis, police said. The building had been evacuated and no injuries were reported.

Earlier Wednesday, a tornado that struck Springdale, Ark., and the adjoining town of Johnson, about 145 miles northwest of Little Rock, shortly after 4 a.m. injured seven people, two critically, according to Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse.

Sprouse said in a statement that one of those critically injured had improved and was in stable condition and the other five were released from a hospital.

""Our first responders have completed door-to-door searches, and we believe everyone has been accounted for,"" Sprouse said.

The National Weather Service in Tulsa said Thursday that the tornado has been rated an EF-3, up from an initial assessment of EF-2, with wind speeds between 136-165 mph. The tornado reached a peak speed of about 145 mph and 5 miles while on the ground for about eight minutes, according to the weather service.

Thousands of vulnerable Afghans who fled their homes have been stranded in Abu Dhabi facilities since last summer as they await travel to their final destination, including the U.S., in spite of assurances that they will get help soon.

The Emirates Humanitarian City in Abu Dhabi is currently housing approximately 9,000 Afghan evacuees. Among these Afghans are those who have worked with the U.S. and the Afghan Armed Forces, as well as other vulnerable Afghans such as journalists, judges, prosecutors, activists and ethnic and religious minorities who fled the country fearing that they would be targeted by the Taliban. Many of them have no clear path to resettlement in the U.S. or other countries.

Months of waiting, broken promises and a lack of clarity about next steps added to Afghans’ trauma of fleeing the Taliban.

Zahra Wahidi, who has lived in one of the two facilities in Abu Dhabi since October, told HuffPost she was promised to be there for no more than a few weeks.

“All I’ve heard since then are broken promises,” Wahidi said.

The frustration caused Afghans to protest inside the facility in February, demanding the U.S. government to resume flights and speed up processing.

“No one knows what’s next for them. People are confused and clueless,” protest organizer Ferdaws Ariayee said. “There is no way to return home and there is no way forward.”

Following the protest, a senior U.S. diplomat paid a visit to the base in March, apologizing to the thousands of Afghans stranded in the UAE and promising to expedite their resettlement to the U.S.

Flights to the U.S. were operating until November of last year, but then suddenly stopped initially due to a measles outbreak among Afghans and then because of other screening requirements. Despite assurances that the process would be resumed as soon as possible, flights effectively remained halted until April of this year.

Only four U.S. government charter flights have taken place since the resumption of the process in early April, According to Ariayee, who was on one of the flights and arrived in the U.S. in mid-May. Most eligible individuals for onward flights — particularly those with special immigrant visas, or SIVs, for people who worked with the U.S. — are expected to be relocated by August.

“We continue to work diligently to facilitate the relocation of all eligible individuals to the U.S. as they complete required medical examinations and other screening procedures required by public health directives and U.S. immigration law,” a State Department spokesperson told HuffPost.

The State Department was unable to provide more details about these flights, citing operational security, traveler safety and privacy concerns.

Those approved for SIVs also have another option, said Anna Lloyd, executive director of Task Force Argo, a group of private citizens working to evacuate Americans and Afghan partners. Those who have an approved SIV, once interviewed, can make independent departures with the help of the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency, by either paying for their tickets or receiving a loan from the agency. They can also receive complete assistance from the International Organization for Migration, but this is often a slower process so the agency can coordinate flights and resettlement assistance.

But not everyone with a clear path to resettlement in the U.S. has an approved SIV. A large number of SIV applicants are in the initial stages of the lengthy SIV application process, which could take months, or even years, to complete. This means that while these applicants will eventually arrive in the U.S., they will not be given priority for travel.

Wahidi worked for several years with a U.S.-funded project in Afghanistan before the Taliban took over and is eligible for an SIV. But she said there has been no update on her SIV status since she applied in September. The SIV pipeline currently has a backlog of tens of thousands of applications that have yet to be processed.

“There are too many people,” Wahidi said, “But the process is slow, and I believe I will be here for much longer than we were promised.”

In addition to SIVs, the State Department says that they are working to process those at the Emirates Humanitarian City who have confirmed cases for priority refugee admission, including those with referrals for the P1 and P2 refugee programs. Certain Afghans who have worked with the U.S. but are not eligible for SIV are eligible for the priority program.

Those may be the only options available to them, in spite of the U.S. government’s repeated assurances that it will not leave vulnerable Afghans behind after withdrawing troops from the country last year. No other visa categories or pathways for Afghans to get to the U.S. have been promised at this time.

No Path Forward

For now, chartered flights out of the Emirates Humanitarian City facilities are only available to those who were evacuated from Afghanistan directly by the U.S. Government as part of noncombatant evacuation operations in August. They do not include thousands of vulnerable Afghans who were relocated to the UAE by NGOs and volunteer groups, many of whom have no path to resettlement in the U.S., Lloyd said.

One of the NGOs helped Nesar Karimi relocate to Abu Dhabi last October; he had been threatened by the Taliban and forced to flee the country. He hopes to reunite with his two daughters living in the U.S. However, he is not eligible for an immigration visa that would allow him to immediately relocate. In order to bring him to the U.S., her daughters applied for humanitarian parole, which allows for temporary entry in the U.S., in December of last year. He has yet to receive a response to his application.

“Some people simply have to wait, but my fate is unknown,” Karimi said.

Since July 1, 45,000 people have applied for humanitarian parole, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Of those applicants, about 2,200 have been denied and approximately 270 have been conditionally approved.

Humanitarian parole cannot be processed in Abu Dhabi, Lloyd said. That visa category and anyone else with no valid pathway to the U.S. must find another country to receive them.

But according to Lloyd, no one is being forced to return to Afghanistan. Thus far, approximately 100 Afghans have repatriated to Afghanistan of their own free will. Most have returned to help family members in Afghanistan who are facing dire conditions, such as starvation.

“The U.S. government has largely abandoned leadership coordination with Afghan allies who served with the U.S. for two decades,” Lloyd said.

She said NGOs have been left to pick up the pieces to find Afghans safe haven in other countries while they await processing from the U.S.

“Our Afghan allies arrived in [the Emirates Humanitarian City] because there were no other options to stay alive and now are in a difficult position in the wake of the State Department’s absenteeism,” she said.

Temporary Housing Turns Long-Term

Emirates Humanitarian City comprises two facilities in an industrial neighborhood of Abu Dhabi. These facilities served as accommodation for the total population of approximately more than 10,000 Afghans over the past eight months. All Afghans have recently moved to one facility.

The royal family of the UAE funds support for Afghans in Emirates Humanitarian City. They provide housing, utilities, food, medical care, activities for children, a mosque and transportation to town for interviews at different embassies. They also brought in a Western Union service for money transfer and allow for mail and packages to be delivered, and even supervise family field trips out in town to boost morale.

“We owe the Royal Family of UAE a sincere amount of gratitude,” Lloyd said.

A State Department spokesperson told HuffPost the U.S. is working with the Emirati government, and thanks the UAE “for its partnership and ongoing support.”

While basic needs are met at the Emirates Humanitarian City, the prolonged confinement within tightly controlled facilities and uncertainty about next step has left some Afghans with serious physical and psychological issues.

“The condition is good here for those who fled a crisis and sought temporary shelter, but some people need better care, especially those with serious illness,” Karimi told HuffPost.

He has been suffering from kidney stones for years, and his problem has deteriorated since he was evacuated. He said that there is no proper treatment inside the Emirates Humanitarian City, and most illnesses are treated with painkillers with no diagnosis. He is scared that he might have long-term health issues if the problem is not treated.

Karimi is also concerned about the children in the facility. If they remain out of school for a long period of time, it might affect their normal learning process, he worries. Although there are schools for children that are set up recently, he said they are largely focused on teaching English.

Many Afghans have volunteered to teach at these schools. Wahidi teaches four days a week and is happy to distract herself with an activity that also helps others, particularly children. She went through months of serious depression and anxiety in the first few months of her arrival, but she had to find a way to deal with the situation.

(Reuters) – A Texas state senator sued the state’s Department of Public Safety on Wednesday for access to the complete records of the shooting at an elementary school in May that killed 19 children and two teachers.

Texas state Senator Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat who represents Uvalde where the mass shooting took place, said that the response to the massacre at the Robb Elementary School “has been full of misinformation and outright lies” from the start. “The community of Uvalde deserves answers now,” he said in a statement after filing the lawsuit in a district court in Travis County.

The state senator said that the department had denied his open records request for documents about the shooting. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said a day earlier that the Uvalde County district attorney has asked the city to not release records related to the district attorney’s probe into the school shooting.

McLaughlin also said the district attorney and the Texas Department of Public Safety have not provided the city with any information on their probe into the shooting.

Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw said on Tuesday the law enforcement response to the shooting was “an abject failure” in which a commander put the lives of officers over those of the children.

Many parents and relatives of the children and staff have expressed deep anger over police action after the gunman entered the school and began shooting.

Greg Abbott, Texas’s Republican governor, has also said he wants all facts regarding the shooting released to the victims’ families and the public as quickly as possible.

The shooting in Uvalde and another racist shooting in Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed at a supermarket, has prompted U.S. lawmakers to work on a deal to curb gun violence.

RICHMOND, VA — A federal judge in Virginia has ruled that a law banning licensed federal firearms dealers from selling handguns to young adults under 21 violates the Second Amendment and is unconstitutional.

The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Payne in Richmond, if not overturned, would allow dealers to sell handguns to 18- to 20-year-olds. In his 71-page ruling, Payne wrote that many of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship are granted at the age of 18, including the right to vote, enlist in the military without parental permission and serve on a federal jury.

“If the Court were to exclude 18-to-20-year-olds from the Second Amendment's protection, it would impose limitations on the Second Amendment that do not exist with other constitutional guarantees,” Payne wrote. “Because the statutes and regulations in question are not consistent with our Nation’s history and tradition, they, therefore, cannot stand,"" he wrote.

Payne's ruling is the latest decision striking down gun laws in the wake of a landmark Supreme Court ruling last year that changed the test courts have long used to evaluate challenges to firearm restrictions. The Supreme Court said judges should no longer consider whether the law serves public interests, like enhancing public safety. Governments that want to uphold a gun restriction must look back into history to show it is consistent with the country’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation,” the Supreme Court said. Amid upheaval in the months since that ruling, courts have declared unconstitutional laws including federal measures designed to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and defendants under felony indictment, as well as a ban on possessing guns with the serial number removed. A federal judge recently cited the high court decision in ruling against a Minnesota law prohibiting 18- to 20-year-olds from getting permits to carry handguns in public. A judge struck down a similar law last year on gun restrictions for young adults in Texas.

Payne, who cited the 2022 Supreme Court ruling repeatedly in his ruling, wrote that the government failed to present “any evidence of age-based restrictions on the purchase or sale of firearms from the colonial era, Founding or Early Republic.” The lack of similar regulations from those time periods indicates that the “Founders considered age-based regulations on the purchase of firearms to circumscribe the right to keep and bear arms confirmed by the Second Amendment,” he wrote. John Corey Fraser, 20, along with several other plaintiffs, challenged the constitutionality of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the associated regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after they were turned down when they tried to buy handguns.

“Even though it ensures that future buyers can now purchase these firearms in the federal system — one that includes background checks and other requirements — we expect the defendants will appeal,"" said Elliott Harding, Fraser's attorney. He said he is optimistic that the ruling will be affirmed. Harding said the lawsuit was aimed at “closing a loophole” because 18- to 20-year-olds can already buy handguns from private sellers, a process that is “completely unregulated.” “This allows them to go in and buy a registered firearm, direct from a manufacturer, but they’ll also go through background checks,"" he said. “They have to go through the traditional steps in purchasing a firearm.” Everytown Law, a legal group that advocates for gun violence prevention in the courts and has filed a brief supporting the age restrictions, said the law is constitutional and an essential tool for preventing gun violence. “Not only are guns the leading cause of death for U.S. kids and teens, but research shows us that 18- to 20-year-olds commit gun homicides at triple the rate of adults 21 years and older,"" said Janet Carter, Everytown Law's senior director of issues and appeals.",Q3

Walking along an interpretive trail and looking into reflective pools of still water and boggy marsh, she names each sound that enters the terrain: the croak of a raven, the ratchet clicks of the squirrel, a jabbering robin.

Arlie Sommer / Idaho Commission on the Arts A marshy area in the Payette National Forest.

“And I always think that's such a lovely message from the robin, ‘cheerily, cheerily, cheer up,’” she said.

Fuhrman is the current Idaho Writer in Residence, part of which entails creating community among writers in the state. She’s expanding the definition of community to include the state’s wilderness, where she takes inspiration from.

Additionally, she is Director of Poetry for Western Colorado University's MFA in Creative Writing Program where she also teaches nature writing. She gives her students advice that’s common but worth repeating: write what you know.

“I can't write the wilderness without being in the wilderness. I can't relate to it or relay it to others without having this deep experience.”

Living so close to nature gives Fuhrman many experiences to recount and compare to life’s stories. One of her favorite sounds is the howl of a wolf.

“It's just such an ancient sound that is both comforting but also a warning.”

She learned to howl a deep, soulful call that rises from her gut and floats through the forest pines.

“That communication, that chance to have conversation with the wild, that is so much fun.”

Arlie Sommer / Idaho Commission on the Arts Peter T. Johnson Interpretive Trail, north of Payette Lake. “Many of these places have been made accessible for wheelchairs and for people who don't have the same levels of mobility, which is really nice that all of us can get out and experience these kinds of wild places, so important,” Fuhrman said.

Fuhrman’s writing takes her all over the West, from her work teaching MFA students in Colorado to directing the Elk River Writers Workshop just north of Yellowstone National Park at Chico Hot Springs in Montana. Fuhrman spends time with the community of the natural world everywhere she travels.

“I often think of myself as indigenous to the West. I'm part glacier and part trillium and part birdsong, and all of that has helped me become who I am.”

Furhrman’s native heritage is in the Four Corners region of the U.S., but to her, indigeneity is about more than just blood. She was adopted and raised in a white family.

“And though my parents did their best in the seventies to bring native culture into my life, it was really difficult.”

Furhman’s mother lovingly braided her hair with beaded barrettes but there was a lack of resources to help native adoptees connect to their culture.

“So I really didn't find native communities until I got older,” she said.

Now Fuhrman focuses on the next generation, describing herself as a ‘future ancestor’ who takes her responsibilities seriously to pass on the planet better than she found it. One way she manifests a better earth is through the attention she gives her fellow beings: the bears, the deer, the fish, the trees. Through writing, the author hopes to help others cultivate connections to the land. Translating that connection doesn’t just happen in front of the computer.

“My longer writing happens in the winter when snow is here, seven feet deep. But everything that manifests, manifests out here.”

A poem she recently wrote for The Inlander, Land Acknowledgement , was written on a trail in the Payette National Forest north of the lake. She wrote Kokanee as she watched the red salmon travel up the North Fork of the Payette. One who derives so much from her natural surroundings notices when that resource is dwindling.

Land Acknowledgment CMarie Furhrman reads, “A poem to acknowledge that the land itself — along with the people whose language, culture and religion were born of it — is rarely acknowledged.” She originally published this the Inlander, October 7, 2021. Listen • 5:10

“I've been thinking so much about sound lately because of the growth in McCall and the sprawl that's coming up, and the land that's just being bulldozed for more houses,” Fuhrman said, referring to sound as yet another being in her community. “How we're losing these sounds because they don't have habitat. All the bird sounds and the wind blowing through the pine and the sound of river.”

Fuhrman finds the subject so crucial that she is making a podcast about these sounds and cataloging them in an effort to get to know them better, the nuances and intricacies.

“There's like 18 different sounds river can make at any bend, from the burbling noise, to the rushing wind noise … to the way it sounds as it riffles, or the way it sounds when it cascades.”

Each voice contributes to a larger conversation and each is worth noting and preserving to Fuhrman, who warns that we won’t be able to replicate these after they’ve disappeared. She’s not only cataloging the existing soundscape, but also remembering what we have already lost.

“This lake used to produce so much salmon. There was a cannery on Payette Lake . The amount of salmon that came up here and the amount that they canned and shipped out to the rest of the world was unbelievable until it was dammed and it was quieted.”

Speaking of the salmon reminds Fuhrman of another sound that used to dominate the rivers of Idaho: the sound of salmon.

A 2001 study estimated that between 14,400 to 57,400 sockeye salmon once returned to the Payette River system annually. Now none return, poisoned by mining, overheated in the warming rivers, and thwarted by dams.

And before pioneers settled on the south shores of Payette Lake, the Nimiipuu (Nez Perce Tribe) traveled annually to the area to fish for their winter supply of salmon in the lake and tributaries. The Nez Perce Treaty of 1855 guaranteed them the right to continue fishing and hunting in the Payette Lake and its tributaries, but after gold was discovered near McCall, their territory was reduced by 90% .

Migrating salmon swim upstream from the ocean to spawn in the late summer and fall. They lay on their side and they make a redd (a gravel nest for their eggs) in the river or in lake shallows. After the females lay eggs, males fertilize the eggs and they cover the nest with gravel together, flapping their tails on the water surface.

“Imagine like 50 bodies slapping the water like that and then all of the other animals that were feeding along the sides. To see it and hear it together is pretty amazing,” Fuhrman said.

She argues the sounds of nature indicate the health and balance of a whole place. Salmon connect into a whole community, feeding birds of prey, bears and fertilizing the trees along the river banks. A report from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife found that 137 species of plants and animals in the Northwest rely on salmon and steelhead.

Arlie Sommer / Idaho Commission on the Arts Fuhrman demonstrates the sound of salmon slapping the water with their tails in the fall, when they travel up Idaho rivers to spawn.

Fuhrman crouches at the bank of the lake to splash her hands on the water and demonstrate the sound of a spawning salmon. As she ponders the multi-layered web, a whirring engine chokes to life in the distance. Birdsongs fade into the background and the sound of a motor boat launching onto the lake now dominates, transforming the peaceful aural landscape.

“When a boat or recreationist comes out, how quickly that drowns out the sound of everything else, especially these small gas engines,” Fuhrman said.

At the height of summer, North Beach will be filled with recreators digging their toes into the sand and swimming in the cool, glacier waters of Payette Lake. According to the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation, 7,811 boat licensees selected Valley County as either their primary or secondary use location in 2021.

The county and seven other agencies who maintain and provide services around waterways in Valley County currently have no way to record how many motorized boats operate annually on specific water bodies in the area but are collaborating on a study for a new Waterways Management Plan to better understand and manage recreational use.

Fuhrman says recreators have a special opportunity to preserve the sounds of McCall if they act with intention to do so.

“I think of how some of these sounds that we're hearing today are sounds that have been heard for 10,000 years that we could all share. We're losing that. And the more and more development that we have and, of course, climate change, we're losing a lot of these species pretty regularly.”

If we lose access to sounds that have existed for centuries, we lose a connection to the past, which Fuhrman says is essential to our well-being. The writer goes to nature to better understand humans and herself. An orphaned bear cub who recently wandered by her back porch, crying from grief, helped her explore her own upbringing and contemplate motherhood and the baby she herself gave up for adoption.

“This kind of chose me. I know I can write. It's about the only thing I do really well and that I feel is a gift that I have.”

She carries an obligation to use her gift for good.

“And so then I think about what matters to me, and these places and people that are marginalized, and these unsung places. I don't want them to go without being heard.”

Fuhrman is chipping away at the world a poem at a time, listening to each voice and channeling each sound towards a greater goal.

“When we think of that being frivolous, writing being this frivolous thing or this thing that doesn't seem to matter at a time of climate change, I disagree. I think that everything we create to celebrate and to show the beauty and the wonder of this place, and to have that deep connection, is saving it.”

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/justice-department-goes-awol-on-domestic-terrorism,Justice Department goes AWOL on domestic terrorism,"Silence can be deafening.

Indeed, it has become impossible not to notice the Justice Department’s conspicuous silence regarding the growing number of attacks on pro-life organizations and public figures. In fact, things have now gotten to the point where the Justice Department’s sluggish response, when there has been a response at all, no longer seems like plain indifference but silent approval.

Since May 3, when a draft Supreme Court majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked to the press, there have been at least 24 attacks on crisis pregnancy centers across the nation. The attacks range from simple vandalism to outright domestic terrorism. On May 3, a pregnancy center in Illinois was razed, causing roughly $250,000 in damages. On May 8, a crisis pregnancy center in Madison, Wisconsin, was firebombed. That same day, a Right to Life office in Keizer, Oregon, was hit with Molotov cocktails. On June 6, a pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, was firebombed. These centers provide diapers and baby supplies to mothers. Along with material aid, they also provide education and training to new parents.

Several Roman Catholic churches have also been targeted since the Supreme Court leak, most likely over the church’s teaching that abortion is a grave moral evil. In other words, the attacks appear to clear the bar for what constitutes a “hate crime.” As the number of attacks on crisis pregnancy centers and Roman Catholic churches rapidly ticks up, pro-abortion activists continue to demonstrate outside the homes of conservative Supreme Court justices.

There’s clearly a coordinated campaign of intimidation and violence aimed at pro-life groups and people, a campaign most likely spearheaded by pro-abortion fanatics. Yet the Justice Department remains frustratingly silent on the matter. The FBI said it is investigating some attacks, but there is no obvious leadership from the top. Bias may play into this dynamic: The Department of Justice official tasked specifically with investigating attacks on “reproductive healthcare facilities” is on the record as having referred to crisis pregnancy centers as “fake clinics.”

A group that calls itself Jane’s Revenge, which has claimed responsibility for attacks on pro-life groups in Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington, Iowa, North Carolina, New York, Florida, Texas, Oregon, and Washington, D.C., released a “communique” this week vowing not just more of the same but worse. “You could have walked away,” the message read. “Now the leash is off. And we will make it as hard as possible for your campaign of oppression to continue.”

It added, “We have demonstrated in the past month how easy and fun it is to attack. We are versatile, we are mercurial, and we answer to no one but ourselves. We promised to take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures. Rest assured that we will, and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.”

This is a clear threat. Yet our chief law enforcement agency remains mum on the matter.

Over on Capitol Hill, it has been more of the same. Though the White House has condemned the violence, Democratic lawmakers on the Hill don’t seem all that interested in doing the same, which is astonishing considering they come from the same end of the political spectrum that believes “silence is violence.”

When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked this week whether Democratic rhetoric helped incite attacks on crisis pregnancy centers, she failed even to condemn the violence. Rather, she said only that “politicizing all of this is uniquely American.”

Her remarks came not long after 27 Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have spent years blaming conservative rhetoric for acts of political violence, voted against a bill to strengthen security measures for Supreme Court justices and their families. Their number includes Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), Cori Bush (D-MO), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Maxine Waters (D-CA). It’s worth noting that this is the same Bush who attempted in 2021 to reconcile her “defund the police” platform with the fact she maintains an armed security detail by saying, “Suck it up. And defunding the police has to happen.”

The Supreme Court bill was put forward shortly after the draft the majority opinion leaked. The Senate approved and unanimously passed the bill almost immediately. However, the House took its sweet time getting around to voting on the proposed legislation. In fact, prior to voting on the bill, Pelosi even seemed annoyed when it was suggested the legislation merited a certain sense of urgency, especially following the June 8 assassination attempt on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

“The justices are protected,” the congresswoman assured reporters not even 24 hours after the assassination attempt. “There will be a bill, but nobody is in danger over the weekend because of not having a bill.”

Really?

At the time of his arrest, Kavanaugh’s would-be assassin, Nicholas John Roske, had a Glock 17 pistol, ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a screwdriver, a nail punch, a crowbar, a pistol light, duct tape, and hiking boots with padding on the outside of the soles. Roske, who was arrested near Kavanaugh’s home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, told police he was upset about the leaked draft Supreme Court majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.

Perhaps Pelosi operates under a different definition of the word “danger?”

Meanwhile, Maryland law enforcement officials reportedly told Kavanaugh’s neighbors that federal authorities are declining to enforce a federal statute against picketing a judge’s home with intent to influence. If true, this would signify a significant dereliction of duty by the federal government.

Last week, after dozens of hate crimes and acts of domestic terrorism aimed at pro-life groups and persons and persistent silence from federal authorities, the White House responded directly to the Jane’s Revenge “communique.”

“Violence and destruction of property have no place in our country under any circumstances, and the president denounces this,” White House assistant press secretary Alexandra LaManna told the Daily Wire.

A jury on Friday acquitted two men of all charges in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer but couldn’t reach verdicts against the two alleged leaders, a stunning defeat for the government after a weekslong trial that centered on an FBI sting operation just before the 2020 election.

The decisions were announced a few hours after the jury said it was struggling to find unanimity on all 10 charges. The judge told the panel to keep working on the fifth day of deliberations, but jurors emerged again after lunch to say they still were deadlocked on some counts.

Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta were found not guilty of conspiracy. In addition, Harris was acquitted of charges related to explosives and a gun.

The jury could not reach verdicts for Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., which means the government can put them on trial again.

Fox’s attorney, Christopher Gibbons, said the acquittals of Harris and Caserta demonstrated some serious shortcomings in the government’s case.

“We’ll be ready for another trial. … We’ll eventually get what we wanted out of this, which is the truth and the justice I think Adam is entitled to,” Gibbons said.

Defense lawyers had portrayed their clients as credulous weekend warriors prone to big, wild talk, who were often stoned. They said FBI undercover agents and informants tricked and cajoled the men into agreeing to a conspiracy.

But prosecutors offered evidence of the men discussing abducting Whitmer before the FBI sting began. They went way beyond talk, including scouting Whitmer’s summer home and testing explosives, prosecutors told jurors.

There were 10 charges in the case: one against Caserta, two against Fox, three against Croft and four against Harris.

Deliberations resumed earlier Friday with a court employee handing over a large plastic bag containing pennies, known as exhibit 291. The pennies were requested before jurors went home Thursday.

Pennies taped to a commercial-grade firework were intended to act like shrapnel, investigators said.

According to evidence, a homemade explosive was detonated during training in September 2020, about a month before the men were arrested.

In his closing argument on April 1, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler said Croft wanted to test the explosive as a possible weapon to use against Whitmer’s security team. He quoted him as saying the pennies would be so hot they could go “right through your skin.”

The trial covered 20 days since March 8, including jury selection, evidence, final arguments and jury deliberations.

Prosecutors offered testimony from undercover agents, a crucial informant and two men who pleaded guilty to the plot. Jurors also read and heard secretly recorded conversations, violent social media posts and chat messages.

Prosecutors said the group was steeped in anti-government extremism and angry over Whitmer’s COVID-19 restrictions.

Croft is from Bear, Delaware, while the others are from Michigan.

Whitmer, a Democrat, rarely talks publicly about the plot, though she referred to “surprises” during her term that seemed like “something out of fiction” when she filed for reelection on March 17.

She has blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case. (AP)",Q3

###

Working in healthcare can be incredibly tiring and stressful — especially over the last two years, with hospitals and caregivers overwhelmed by the pandemic. This week, two of our local hospitals, Providence St. Joseph and Providence Redwood Memorial, introduced a new and interesting way to combat stress in the workplace – baby goat therapy.



That’s right. Baby goat therapy.



Baby goat therapy is one type of animal therapy – sometimes called animal-assisted therapy or pet therapy – an increasingly popular practice wherein people spend time holding and petting animals to help reduce stress. Proponents of animal therapy say it has many mental and physical health benefits, including decreasing stress and anxiety, improving mood, reducing fatigue and lowering blood-pressure, to name a few.



“I think it’s a great opportunity to go from a working environment to something that’s soothing, relaxing,” Hilary Eisenburg, from the gastroenterology department, said as she held a baby goat in her arms. “It just feels really nurturing.”



Eisenburg was one of many hospital caregivers, some taking breaks from their shift and others coming in on their day off, who lined up to try out the goat therapy at Providence St. Joseph Hospital on Thursday. As folks entered a room toward the back of the hospital, they sat in a chair and were handed a goat to basically just hold for a little while. The overall response seemed to be joy, with periodic “aw”s from the people from cuteness overload.



Rachel Conway of Francis Creek Ranch in Ferndale brought four goats – two 9-day-olds, named Oreo and Caramel, and two 2-day-olds, who don’t yet have names – from the farm to the hospital. The goats also went for a visit to Redwood Memorial Hospital on Wednesday. Conway said this was her first time facilitating goat therapy sessions, although the ranch does host farm tours where people have a chance to visit with the goats. The goat kids enjoy being held by humans, Conway said, especially when they are very young.



“These guys are all bottle babies and so humans are ‘mom,’’’ Conway told the Outpost. “The older they get, the more they want breaks and don’t want to be in laps all the time.”



And the cuddliness varies with different goats’ personalities too, Conway said. Oreo, for example, is a bit more wily and needs to take a break from being held at least every 30 minutes. Other goats can go closer to an hour without a break. When the goats start looking restless and are wiggling around a lot in someone’s arms, Conway gives them a break by placing them in a pen so they can run and jump around a bit. Conway knows the goats are ready to be held again when they start bleating for attention.



Roberta Luskin-Hawk MD, chief executive for Providence St. Joseph, said that with the increased stress of the pandemic, the hospital has been searching for ways to support the mental health of its caregivers and has made multiple wellness initiatives and services available – including therapy, apps for yoga and meditation. When Luskin-Hawk saw a video of caregivers at a hospital in Oregon receiving baby goat therapy to help them cope with the stresses of the pandemic, she knew it was something she wanted to try. She emailed Christie Duray, volunteer services coordinator, and she just ran with it, Luskin-Hawk said.



This week’s baby goat therapy sessions were a pilot program, Luskin-Hawk said, to see how things went and if it really seemed beneficial. Because the response from the hospital workers was so positive, Luskin-Hawk said the hospitals will almost definitely do it again.



“Our life is very frenetic in healthcare and we’re always responding to something,” Luskin-Hawk said during Thursday’s goat therapy session. “But when you’re holding a baby or a baby goat, you really have to slow down your breathing, get centered and be present. It’s not something that we’re all good at doing on our own, and this forces us to do it. So it’s really pretty cool.”

Charlie Crist, candidate for governor of Florida, released a statement in response to the DeSantis administration’s latest attack on the LGBTQ community made June 2.

This attack was through the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, in a report falsely claiming that gender affirming health care is experimental. These claims were made intending to deny coverage for trans Floridians who qualify for Medicaid.

“For Governor DeSantis to once again launch attacks on the LGBTQ+ community – let alone during Pride Month – is disgraceful and dangerous. He put quacks and right-wing ideologues in charge to fight his culture wars, while Floridians are the ones paying the price,” Crist said in a statement. “Today’s report is yet another painful example of our authoritarian bully governor abusing his power and inserting himself into your doctor’s office if he doesn’t like you, doesn’t agree with you, or doesn’t understand you. Free state, indeed.”

Despite these claims made by the DeSantis administration, other medical professionals including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association and the American Public Health Association oppose this governmental intrusion of healthcare and say gender affirming healthcare is vital for the mental health of individuals that need it.

“The AMA opposes the dangerous intrusion of government into the practice of medicine and the criminalization of health care decision-making,” said AMA board member Michael Suk. “Gender-affirming care is medically-necessary, evidence-based care that improves the physical and mental health of transgender and gender-diverse people.”

Crist strongly condemns the claims the DeSantis administration has made, and is vocal about his desire to allow all Floridians equal access to health care.

“In my vision of a Florida for all, trans Floridians will be able to get the health care their doctor recommends, regardless of what insurance they qualify for. We are all children of God, and we all deserve respect and compassion. When I’m governor, your agencies will be staffed by people who respect the LGBTQ+ community and trust doctors,” Crist said in a statement.",Q3
https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/investigations/protest-arrests/mcao-ignored-warnings-about-prosecutor-they-bred-this-monster,MCAO ignored warnings about prosecutor; 'They bred this monster',"PHOENIX — UPDATE: The Maricopa County Attorney's Office confirmed that April Sponsel was issued an official letter of termination the week of June 27, 2022.

—

April Sponsel was an award-winning prosecutor inside the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office.

She was handpicked to join the newly-created First Responder Bureau, which handpicked 2020 protest cases to aggressively prosecute.

But after ABC15’s “Politically Charged” investigation exposed widespread corruption in multiple protest cases, top MCAO officials shucked responsibility and blamed Sponsel by placing her on leave and under investigation.

POLTICALLY CHARGED: ABC15 EXPOSED MCAO, PHOENIX PD CORRUPTION

The office began the process to officially fire Sponsel this week.

Sponsel, who’s spent nearly two decades years at MCAO, claims the office is making her the “scapegoat in order to blunt the criticism” from ABC15’s reporting.

Some of her harshest critics think she’s right.

“I agree. They scapegoated her,” said Marci Kratter, a defense attorney who’s spent years and many cases opposite of Sponsel. “They bred this monster. They taught her how to do it. They nourished her on it. They encouraged it. They allowed it. And then, they threw her under the bus when they get caught.”

On June 6, Deputy Chief Paul Ahler issued Sponsel a 14-page “Notice of Intent to Dismiss” – a summary of why MCAO feels the veteran prosecutor should no longer keep her job.

The investigation into Sponsel began in March 2021.

It was weeks after ABC15 exposed that MCAO prosecutors colluded with Phoenix police officers to falsely charge dozens of protesters in multiple cases.

The most egregious example occurred following a protest on October 17, 2020, when officials invented a fake gang and then charged protesters as members.

The dismissal notice highlights widespread misconduct in that case and problems in four others handled by Sponsel in 2020 and 2021.

“Based on your extreme overcharging and lack of appropriate follow-up and review in the cases discussed above, I cannot trust that you are able to do the work of a (prosecutor),” Ahler wrote. “The fact that your administrative interview demonstrated no self-reflection or any recognition that you made mistakes, even knowing that you indicted an innocent person, reaffirms my decision that termination is the only appropriate option.”

Ahler recently joined MCAO as Chief Deputy under newly-appointed County Attorney Rachel Mitchell, who took over after Allister Adel’s resignation .

Mitchell moved to fire Sponsel within her first two months officially leading the office. It's not clear why the internal investigation remained open for more than a year under Adel.

Defense attorneys, and even some current and former MCAO prosecutors believe the notice highlights a disturbing attempt by MCAO to whitewash its broader role in enabling Sponsel’s misconduct.

“This is not a rogue prosecutor,” Kratter said. “This is the culture at the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office.”

Public defender Katie Gipson-McLean, who represented on of the people falsely charged in a protest case, called out MCAO leaders online following a previous ABC15 report about Sponsel’s pending termination.

“I reported April to The Bar over a year ago for her conduct in the 10/17 case,” Gipson-McLean tweeted. “She is responsible for securing the indictments, it was her bar number attached. However, top DCAs knew and did nothing, and she is getting thrown under the bus to save face for everyone else.”

Former prosecutor Derek Debus, who worked at MCAO in 2020, responded to Gipson-McLean’s tweet by posting, “Facts. Big Facts.”

Multiple defense attorneys shared emails sent to MCAO supervisors over the years about Sponsel’s conduct and charging decisions but said those concerns were ignored.

In one example, attorneys for activist Bruce Franks Jr., who was falsely charged after an August 9, 2020 protest , sent detailed information to Sponsel’s supervisor outlining problems with their case.

The defense attorneys wrote they felt her conduct may be an issue for the State Bar to look at.

In response, MCAO Division Chief Vince Goddard emailed Sponsel this reply: “If he believes that’s what you did, he is obligated to file the bar complaint. His problem is if he says that and DOESN’T file one. That’s when he’s acting unethically.”

Sponsel emailed her boss back with a smiley face emoji.

Beyond the protest cases, the dismissal notice gave specific details of problems with overcharging a lack of evidence review in multiple cases.

In a 2020 case, Sponsel is accused of overcharging a man named Charles Walker, who resisted arrest after a shoplifting call.

During the arrest, an officer got a small cut on his hand.

He didn’t know how it happened, but the suspect had been holding a pen. So Sponsel charged the man with Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon, a class 2 felony.

“Your charging decision treated Walker the same as a person who shoots and officer or stabs and officer with a knife,” Ahler wrote in the notice. “If convicted, your charging decision subjected Mr. Walker, a defendant with no prior felony convictions, to a mandatory prison term of no less than ten and a half years – with no possibility of early release – for causing a minor injury to an officer’s hand.”

In the handful of cases highlighted in her dismissal notice, Sponsel was accused of misrepresenting facts to grand juries and misleading them.

Defense attorneys told ABC15 it’s not a surprise and represents problems they’ve constantly seen in Sponsel’s cases throughout her career.

At a press briefing Wednesday, ABC15 asked Mitchell if the office plans to review any more of Sponsel’s past cases.

“Obviously, that’s an active personnel matter. So, I have to be careful not to discuss the details of that,” Mitchell said. “If there is additional cases in the past, beyond the time (Sponsel) was in the First Responder Bureau, that people have concerns about or want us to look at those, we can certainly do that through the Prosecution Integrity Unit.”

Kratter told ABC15 that’s too passive and that MCAO has an affirmative duty to disclose Sponsel’s misconduct for every past and present case.

“It’s completely inadequate,”Kratter said. “If I were county attorney, I would be having the office pull every case that Sponsel ever touched. I would treat it almost like a product defect, a product liability case. And I would send a letter to every defendant and every defense attorney and say, ‘We have now learned one of our prosecutors is unethical and you may be impacted by that.’”

Sponsel’s civil attorney has not responded to ABC15’s requests for comment about the dismissal letter.

She filed a lawsuit against Maricopa County earlier this year, alleging she was defamed by Adel and other top officials. The lawsuit claims that Sponsel had a “stellar reputation” and exceptional evaluations.

But that changed because of the fallout from ABC15’s reporting.

“Soon after the Violent Protest Case Charges had been dismissed, Sponsel realized that she would become Adel’s scapegoat in order to blunt the criticism leveled by the news media, to absolve herself of any personal responsibility for bringing the charges, and to blunt the politically damaging consequences of making or approving the decision to bring the charges,” according to the lawsuit.

Other records reviewed by ABC15 show Sponsel was a go-to prosecutor inside MCAO over the years.

The office often touted her experience and used Sponsel to hold special training classes to teach police officers how to testify.

“Sponsel was training police officers how to testify,” Kratter said. “And the bench, the Superior Court of Maricopa County, was allowing her to use courtrooms so she could teach them to testify properly. This is as bankrupt as it gets.”

The dismissal notice against Sponsel also wrongly presents MCAO employees as a proactive and righteous force in holding her accountable for the protest cases and correcting the injustice.

“Without intervention from others in this office, it is unknown how long (a protest defendant arrested on October 17, 2020) would have been indicted before you got around to reviewing the exculpatory evidence you had,” Ahler wrote.

MCAO officials defended Sponsel’s charges in advance of ABC15’s “Politically Charged” investigation.

It was only after the station published secret grand jury transcripts and broadcast body camera and surveillance footage that the county attorney’s office took any action, according to internal text messages, emails, and other correspondence obtained by ABC15.

Videos from the the scene show pedestrians dashing through the Crossroads of the World just before 7pm.

In a video posted to social media, a young woman films herself as crews respond to the manhole fires. The explosion is then heard and she begins to run.

'What the f***?' What the f*** was that?'

The FDNY did not reveal the reason for the manhole explosion but officials found elevated carbon monoxide levels at 229 West 43rd Street after the blast. High levels of the odorless and colorless gas, which can lead to brain damage or death, were likely caused by the entrapped manhole fires.

Firefighters were in the process of 'venting and mitigating the cellar and sub-cellar of the location' before they handed the scene over to utility companies by 9pm.

There were no injuries.

The explosion rattled an already jittery city that has seen crime skyrocket since the start of the pandemic. Overall crime is up 44.13 percent across the city from this time last year, with shooting victims up 14.5 percent.

The crowd quickly empties out of the Crossroads of the World after the inexplicable blast

One young woman who was recording the fire trucks in the area hears a loud bang and takes off running with the crowd nearby. Fire officials said they found three manholes on fire in the area. The cause of the fires was unknown

Overall crime in the city has risen 44 percent in the first three months of the year and police are now saying that hundreds of repeat offenders have been arrested at least three times

The blast took place as crowds were gathering outside theaters for Broadway shows in the popular tourist hub.

One video shows fearful crowds running down the sidewalk as others join in without knowing what's really happening.

'I don’t know what it is but…,' a man says in one video 'What is it? I heard something.'

The blast was likely caused by three manhole fires reported in the area, the FDNY said.

The cause of Sunday's fires has not been determined.

Footage from the 24/7 EarthCam above Duffy Square - site of Times Square's iconic red steps - shows a crowd lingering in the area just before 7pm when, suddenly, groups of people start running in one direction.

The square is partially emptied out by the time the panic dies down a few seconds later.

One nearby resident tweeted: 'Feeling relieved. With it being the start holy week, I was very scared. When I say my whole apartment shook, my goodness! Hoping to get more details on the manhole explosion. Two in two years. Wild.'

The city's fire department was assisting utility companies in finding out the cause of the manhole fires that led to the blast. The scene was turned over to the utility companies by 9pm.

The loud blast came as a shock to visitors of the city's most popular tourist destination as crime rates continue to rise in the Big Apple.

On Saturday, a 17-year-old was arrested and charged in the Friday slaying of a 16-year-old girl, who was described as a 'beautiful soul' by her family.

Jeremiah Ryan, 17, was charged with murder, attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon by the NYPD in the killing of Angellyh Yambo, 16, near her Bronx school.

Angellyh Yambo, 16, (pictured in 2020) was walking home with two others around 2pm on Friday when she was struck in the chest with a bullet

'Last night, we were able to bring in Jeremiah Ryan and place him in custody,' NYPD Chief Timothy McCormack said at a press conference Saturday, adding that the boy is working with police.

'We have two families that are completely destroyed right now - our victim's family and our shooter's family,' McCormack said.

Police were investigating whether the shooting suspect, who has no criminal record, was using a so-called 'ghost gun' - a homemade firearm that can be built with parts bought online and lacks a serial number normally used to trace it. They said a total of six rounds were fired .

Yambo was walking home with two friends at around 2pm on Friday when she was struck in the chest with a bullet, having been caught in the crossfire of two reported criminals on opposite sides of the street when an argument broke out between them.

She was rushed to Lincoln Medical Center after emergency personnel were seen performing chest compressions on her in the street as blood pooled around her. Yambo could not be saved and was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has announced a plan to give judges more power over bail for repeat offenders and to pursue more cases against minors after she admitted New Yorkers' trust in safety has 'shattered.'

Hochul, 63, who has recently announced she will be running for a full term as governor, announced on Thursday that judges will have more discretion over bail for repeat offenders or those charged with gun trafficking.

he new law would also amend the current statutes on illegal gun trafficking, setting the number of illegal firearms needed for bail at three, down from 10.

https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-709452,Yeshiva University now obligated to host LGBTQ+ club on campus,"The New York County Supreme Court ruled that New York’s Yeshiva University is required to grant recognition to its LGBTQ club, the YU Pride Alliance.

Court ruling

Judge Lynn Kotler ruled on Tuesday that YU, as a non-religious organization, is subject to the New York City Human Rights Law and directed it to “immediately grant plaintiff YU Pride Alliance the full equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges afforded to all other student groups at Yeshiva University.” In the decision, the judge determined that “Yeshiva University is not a ‘religious corporation,’” and therefore cannot ban a certain group because of the Jewish faith.

YU must ""immediately grant plaintiff YU Pride Alliance the full equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges afforded to all other student groups at Yeshiva University."" Judge Lynn Kotler

In addition, she ordered that defendants, Yeshiva University and President Ari Berman, be “permanently restrained from continuing their refusal to officially recognize the YU Pride Alliance as a student organization because of the members’ sexual orientation or gender and/or YU Pride Alliance’s status, mission, and/or activities on behalf of LGBTQ students.”

LGBTQ flag (credit: Wikimedia Commons) Yeshiva University's argument

""The court’s ruling violates the religious liberty upon which this country was founded. The decision permits courts to interfere in the internal affairs of religious schools, hospitals, and other charitable organizations. Any ruling that Yeshiva is not religious is obviously wrong,"" YU said in response to the ruling.

In 2020, YU wrote a paper titled Fostering an Inclusive Community on the issue of LGBTQ people in its institution. “Yeshiva University is wholly committed to and guided by Halacha [Jewish law] and Torah values,” the paper began. “These direct our every effort in establishing a caring campus community that is supportive of all its members.”

In the document, YU said that a team of administrators, psychologists and rabbis spent four months meeting with individual students and alumni, in order to learn more about these issues and how the students experience them.

The institution announced the steps it would take to address them. There would be “increased support for students who have raised concerns regarding sexual orientation and gender identity,” and training for staff would be updated to include a brief on sexual orientation, “ensuring that there is a clinician on staff with specific LGBTQ+ experience” and appointing a point person to oversee a “Warm Line” available for students.

According to YU’s independent student newspaper The Commentator, YU will appeal the decision. “While we love and care for our students, who are all – each and every one – created in God’s image, we firmly disagree with today’s ruling and will immediately appeal the decision,” a YU spokesperson told The Commentator.

Why sue in the first place? LGBTQ discrimination

“Yeshiva University will be a safer place,” wrote Molly Meisels, one of the plaintiffs, on their Instagram. Meisels, three other YU students and the YU Pride Alliance sued the school in April 2021 after a number of failed attempts to form the club.

In April, the university’s official student newspaper reported that the YU Pride Alliance, a student and three alumni announced an LGBTQ discrimination lawsuit against the university, Berman and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Dr. Chaim Nissel at a virtual press conference.

“Since 2019... our club applications have been repeatedly rejected, and so we are grateful that the court has affirmed our legal right to equal accommodations and the right to the same opportunities afforded to every other club at YU,” reads a statement from the YU Pride Alliance.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Yeshiva University Pride Alliance (@yupridealliance)

According to the newspaper, their case stated that “YU illegally discriminated against them when the university thrice rejected their proposal for an official LGBTQ club in 2019 and 2020.”

In their complaint, the group of students and alumni stated that “YU’s refusal to officially recognize the club deprives Plaintiff the YU Pride Alliance and its members of the important benefits enjoyed by YU’s 116 other recognized student organizations.” The students said that they were not allowed to use campus facilities for meetings, adding that “the [YU Pride] Alliance must meet off-campus” because they were allegedly forbidden to convene on campus.

In addition, the Alliance had to “fundraise outside the university for its own events, speakers and snacks.”

“It’s been a long and hard battle fighting with YU,” wrote Beth Weiss, who was on the founding board of the Pride Alliance and was the public face of the club for a semester while they were on campus. “As a closeted undergrad, I got involved in the cause.”

Established in 1886, YU is a private university with four campuses in New York City. Inspired by modern and centrist Orthodox Judaism, it also has a yeshiva and Judaic studies programs. The motto of the university is “Torah U’mada” (Torah and secular knowledge). Even though most of the university’s students are Jewish, they don’t all subscribe to the Jewish faith.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/07/us/ancient-roman-statue-bought-texas-goodwill-trnd/,"A $34.99 Goodwill purchase turned out to be an ancient Roman bust that’s nearly 2,000 years old","CNN —

A $34.99 purchase got one Texas woman an unexpected piece of art from ancient Roman times.

Back in August 2018, Laura Young was shopping in an Austin-area Goodwill when she stumbled upon a 52-pound marble bust.

“I was just looking for anything that looked interesting,” Young said, and when she saw it, she knew she had to have it.

“It was a bargain at $35, there was no reason not to buy it,” Young said. She told CNN Friday she has been reselling her antique finds since 2011.

After the transaction, she knew she had to do some digging to see if the piece had any history to it.

And history it had.

Little did she know that purchase would have Roman ties and end up in the San Antonio Museum of Art (SAMA), 4 years later.

She contacted auction houses and experts to get any information she could on the marble structure.

Eventually, Sotheby’s confirmed that the bust was in fact from ancient Roman times, and they estimated it to be about 2,000 years old.

A specialist was able to track down the bust on a digital database and found photos from the 1930s of the head in Aschaffenburg in Bavaria, Germany.

Lynley McAlpine, a postdoctoral curatorial fellow at SAMA, told CNN it is believed to be the bust of Sextus Pompey, a Roman military leader. His father, Pompey the Great, was once an ally of Julius Caesar.

The bust was housed in a replica of a Pompeii home, also known as Pompejanum, which was commissioned by King Ludwig I of Bavaria.

There it was on display until World War II, which was the last time it was seen until Young bought it in 2018.

The bust, along with other artifacts in the home, had been moved into storage before the Pompejanum was bombed and destroyed during the war. At some point, the piece was stolen from storage.

“It seems like sometime between when it was put into storage until about 1950, someone found it and took it,” McAlpine said. “Since it ended up in the US it seems likely that some American that was stationed there got their hands on it.”

Young says she still wonders just how the piece ended up at a Goodwill in Austin, Texas.

The bust, believed to be of Sextus Pompey, will be on display at the San Antonio Museum of Art until May 2023. Courtesy Laura Young

She said she tried to find the person who donated the statue through Craigslist, but had no luck.

“I would really love it if whoever donated it came forward,” Young said. “It’s most likely not the original person who took him, but would still like to know the story.”

The piece is currently being lent out contractually to SAMA for a year, but McAlpine explains it is still technically owned by Germany since it was looted from storage.

Young is proud to see her unique find on display for others to learn its history, but after May 2023, the bust will be sent back to Germany where it’ll go back on display, once again, in the Pompejanum.",Q3

Adam Lee Black was fatally shot Thursday night. Investigators say a Walmart employee and other customers confronted the suspect, Anthony Brown, who was alleged to have been shoplifting in the electronics section.

Brown opened fire and killed Black and also injured an employee.

According to Black’s family, he was a security guard. They say he sprung into action when he saw someone in need. His mother says he died doing what he passionate about.

""It's like the minute you do something right and get on the best path somebody steals it from you,"" his mother Shirley Damron said. She says her son had just moved to Hamilton with his fiancee and was expecting a child.

""I was so proud of the man that he become because he worked so hard to get there,” she said.

""I want to be assured that this man Anthony Brown will never forget my son,” Damron said. “You took my sons life. I hope he will never be allowed to walk the street again.”

Brown was already out on bond for a pending robbery case.

“It's so senseless our criminal system isn't keeping people behind bars,” Damron said. “They’re letting them out so they can commit the same offenses again.”

Black's mother wants justice for her son's death. She’s remembering him as a caring and kind person who was the life of the party.

""My son was a hero, and I want everyone in the state of Ohio and this country to know my son,” Damron said. “I want him to be known for the bravery he provided to help Walmart and anyone that was there in the line of that man trying to get away.”

In March 2022, three young students stabbed their teacher to death at a girl’s seminary in Dera Ismail Khan. Only extreme levels of hatred can instigate a person to kill someone. That our young people have so much hatred against other people is disturbing. In the Dera Ismail Khan incident, a teacher was killed because a teenager had a dream. How is this justifiable? It will take generations to tackle this extremism. Pakistani society is unfortunately rife with incidents of mob lynching over allegations of blasphemy. It is shocking that things have now reached an extreme level where even students are not thinking twice before killing their teachers. Our generation must take responsibility for correcting the course of society and eliminating extremism from all walks of life.

That was until six plaintiffs filed a suit in 1993 to have the law declared unconstitutional, it would take years for the case to wind its way through the courts before it was settled in 1997.

""We were illegal, and how this law was used was not used to lock people up. it was used by somebody who had a complaint about discrimination or any mistreatment. it's, oh, you're admitting to a felony, and so it was very important to get this law declared unconstitutional on and off the books,"" said Linda Gryczan, lead plaintiff in Gryczan v. Montana, a Montana supreme court case to declare Montana code 45-5-505 discriminatory.

The statute stated that ""deviate sexual conduct"" between two people of the same sex or causes another to engage in deviate relations commits the offense of deviate sexual conduct, and people found guilty faced as much as ten years in prison and fines up to 50,000 dollars.

The groundbreaking Montana Supreme Court Decision 25 years ago, proved to be a major step forward in the fight for equality, even if came the same year that the Montana Legislature passed a law specifically barring same-sex marriage. It would be another 18 years before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage.

“You know those things couldn’t have happened if it wasn't for the work of the people before us,” said Stacey Haugland, another plaintiff in the case.

Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry on Saturday released an updated list of nearly 1,000 Americans permanently barred from entering the country, a largely symbolic slap in response to harsh sanctions imposed by Western countries for its brutal invasion of Ukraine in February.

Biden since mid-March had already been banned from visiting Russia, as were Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

But the updated list now includes Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as Biden's scandal-plagued son Hunter Biden, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and first lady.

The actor Morgan Freeman and billionaire investor George Soros also made the list. Soros' philanthropic support of liberal causes, and groups in the former Soviet bloc, have made him a boogeyman for both Russia and right-wing conspiracy theorists.

Jen Psaki, who until this month served as Biden's White House press secretary, posted a sarcastic tweet about the list Saturday evening: ""I guess we will have to cancel our August family trip to Moscow…""

Trump was not on the list of 963 banned Americans.

Over the years, Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticized investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election that ended with Trump's victory over Democratic rival Clinton.

Trump was impeached in 2019 for withholding congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine while pressuring that country's then-newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to announce investigations into Joe Biden, who at the time was the leading Democratic candidate for the White House.

Trump was acquitted after a trial in the Senate.

On Saturday morning, in an interview with Fox News, Trump griped about the Russia probe again.

""This is one of the greatest political scandals in history,"" Trump said. ""Where do I get my reputation back?""

A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his omission from Russia's travel-ban list.

Former President Barack Obama and Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, also are not on the list, but Pence's brother, Rep. Greg Pence, R-Ind., is banned.

So are 211 of Greg Pence's fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate — along with 224 Democratic members of both congressional chambers.

The GOP House members on the banned list included two hard-core, Republican Trump supporters, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Arizona's Paul Gosar.

Also making the list are two Democratic House members whose strongly progressive policy stances are anathema to Trump World: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Minnesota's Rep. Ilhan Omar.

So is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who this week also was banned from receiving communion by the archbishop of the San Francisco Roman Catholic Archdiocese because of her support for abortion rights.

In a statement published by Russia's state news agency RIA, the Foreign Ministry said, ""Russian counter-sanctions are of a forced nature and are aimed at forcing the ruling American regime to change its behavior"" and recognize ""new geopolitical realities.""

The ministry also accused the U.S. of trying to impose a neo-colonial ""rules-based world order"" on the rest of the world.

The ministry said ""hostile actions"" taken by the U.S. government ""boomerang back to hit the United States itself"" and ""will continue to receive proper rebuffs.""

It's an example, too, of how the transition to cleaner forms of energy as mandated by state law will be complicated for a variety of sectors of the economy, and how many workers don't want to be left behind.

UAW Local 774 President Wence Valentin worries the measure will benefit electric vehicle companies that are not supportive of union labor.

""We lose market share, we lose jobs. So what we're looking for is more jobs for the community that pays a sustaining wage,"" he said. ""If you're a union member, you're getting a sustaining wage in New York state.""

Valentin, who represents retired and current workers at a car manufacturing plant in North Tonawanda, was among the UAW members who rallied in Albany against the measure. Lawmakers, as they move to enact clean energy measures should keep in mind the impact on workers, he said.

""In essence, they work for us,"" Valentin said. ""So they need to make sure we have good jobs throughout the state of New York that pay a sustaining wage.""

But Jim Chen, the vice president for policy of electric vehicle maker Rivian, said the electric vehicle companies and their business models are going to be essential for meeting climate targets.

""Really it's going to take direct to consumer manufacturers like Rivan, like Tesla, like Lucid, to really move the needle,"" Chen said.

He points to states like Florida that give consumers more access to buying an electric vehicle directly from the manufacturer, which is meant to create a seamles process for service, charging and software upgrades.

The debate is part of a broader set of changes being considered as New York phases out fossil fuels in the coming decades. It's a major transition that will impact millions of New Yorkers.

Enacting the measure will change in broad strokes how homes and buildings are powered and require a transition away from gas-powered vehicles. Supporters of the law want to enact it without disruption to energy service or to the broader economy.

The state's climate change council and policymakers have been mindful of the benefits for labor: Off-shore wind projects on the Long Island Sound are being built with union workers, and top labor leaders have a seat at the table of the council.

Alex Heil of the Citizens Budget Commission said lawmakers must closely follow the effects of the policy changes.

""We'll need data on the cost and the benefit of particular strategies and what it will actually mean to achieve some of these objectives,"" Heil said.

For advocates like Liz Moran of EarthJustice, New York can't afford to wait to act on climate change in order to reach the benchmarks of switching to renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions.

""We have to be putting policies on the books that transition New York state off of fossil fuels,"" Moran said, ""and toward a renewable energy future.""",Q3

Others making the list published Saturday on the ministry’s website include U.S. government officials, lawmakers and other political figures including politicians Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and, somewhat mysteriously, the late Senator John McCain.

McCain is one of three former senators to appear on the list who are deceased. Among the living are Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and George Soros.

All are accused of “inciting Russophobia” by Moscow in retaliation for similar moves by Washington since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, SKY News reports.

Reiner’s and Freeman’s entries make reference to their work together in support of the Committee to Investigate Russia, a nonprofit focused on exposing allegations of Russian interference in U.S. elections.

Reiner is on the advisory board of the group, which launched in 2017, while Freeman, 84, voiced over a video it released.

“We have been attacked,” Freeman said in the video, referring to Russia’s still unproven interference in the 2016 presidential election. “We are at war.”

“The Russian counter-sanctions are necessary and aim to constrain the U.S. which is trying to impose a neocolonial ‘world order’ on the rest of the planet… to change its position and recognise new geopolitical realities,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in its statement.

Moscow claimed it remained open to “honest dialogue” and drew a distinction between the people of the U.S. and the authorities “inciting Russophobia.”

The stay was issued after a Staten Island judge just hours earlier struck down New York City's mask mandate for toddlers, calling it ""arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable"" and issuing a permanent injunction against it.

Mayor Eric Adams said in a tweet after the stay was granted that ""every decision we make is with our children's health and safety in mind,"" saying that the young children ""should continue to wear their masks in school and daycare come Monday.""

Every decision we make is with our children’s health and safety in mind.



Children between 2 and 4 should continue to wear their masks in school and daycare come Monday. — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) April 1, 2022

Adams had said that the city was going appeal in order to seek the stay of Judge Ralph Porzio's ruling. Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said the city was not recommending that young kids ages 2-4 stop masking yet, and he sounded a broader note of caution too.

""Cases are definitively rising and it's gotten our attention,"" he said. ""They will continue to rise over the next few weeks, and it's likely that over these weeks, we will move into a different level of overall risk across the city.""

Vasan said he was ""recommending"" people wear masks in public, indoor settings.

A New York City judge ruled to end the city's mask mandate for children under 5 years old, but the city is fighting to keep it in place. So where does this leave parents and children? NBC New York's Andrew Siff reports.

In a statement after the judge initially shot down the mandate, the city teachers union said that as the legal process continues, ""we need to keep the focus on other measures that are helping to keep schools safe — encouraging vaccinations for those eligible, aggressive testing, and following cleaning and ventilation protocols.""

Things have changed since the mayor first announced a plan on March 22 to make masks optional as of April 4 for the youngest kids. Positivity rates and case totals are rising, and transmission rates in the city are up 19% over that time.

The more critical metrics -- hospitalizations and deaths -- remain on the decline, and officials have said they don't expect a new severe surge linked to BA.2. That said, the city is still erring on the side of caution.

Right now, the community COVID alert level citywide is low, under the new benchmark system Adams unveiled earlier this month. It doesn't get any lower. So far, the risk level hasn't changed since the school mandate lifted on March 7, which the mayor called a ""great sign"" as he declared it time to ""peel back another layer.""

Kids younger than 2 have not been subject to mask mandates since the pandemic started.

It's been called ""stealth omicron"" or ""deltacron."" A new subvariant of the COVID-19 virus is making headlines, so we talked to NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres to learn more. He explained how the variant ""plagiarizes"" from the Omicron and Delta variants that previously caused surges, and why this may not cause a new surge here in the U.S.

While BA.2 does appear to be ""inherently more transmissible"" than the original omicron strain, the World Health Organization has said, experts say they don't expect it to trigger a major resurgence given high vaccination rates and so many people having been recently infected with the first omicron strain.

BA.2 is now the dominant COVID strain in both New York and America. Earlier this week, the feds authorized a second booster dose for millions more Americans to help stem the potential tide of new infections among the most vulnerable.

There was a major setback in a 20-year-old New York cold case police said they had cracked — and it's a mistake that set the alleged killer free.

Last week, New York State Police announced an arrest in the 2003 murder of Megan McDonald, whose baffling case featured on ""Dateline"" ahead of the milestone anniversary of her slaying.

His name is Edward Holley, 42, and he was charged with second-degree murder in McDonald's death. He would have been in his 20s at the time, and police said the two had dated but broke up in the days leading up to the killing.

Troopers declined to release much information about his arrest, other than to say he was in county jail at the time on an unrelated charge when he was served with the McDonald warrant. There's one problem, according to prosecutors.

No one ever told the district attorney's office about it. And Holley was released from custody before dawn Thursday.

Standard operating procedure for Orange County criminal cases involves notifying the district attorney's office of such pending arrests. Shortly after State Police revealed Holley's, Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler said that protocol wasn't followed.

Hoovler appeared to criticize the decision to make the arrest without telling his office, saying that ""The family of the victim, and the entire community, deserve to have homicide cases handled in the best way possible to provide the greatest opportunity for offenders to be held accountable.""

He added that his office will prioritize the investigation and the prosecution, which a special prosecutor will oversee. Hoover's office has yet to take the McDonald case to a grand jury.

""Once a defendant is charged and held in custody, the grand jury must vote an indictment within no longer than six days from the date of the arrest or the defendant must be released. For that reason, complicated cases are normally at least partially presented to a grand jury before an arrest is made,"" Hoovler said in the statement. ""The preferred practice is for police agencies to coordinate with prosecutors on serious cases. Grand jury presentations on “cold” homicide cases involving complicated fact patterns can rarely be commenced and completed within six days, without prior coordination.""

A 42-year-old New York man has been arrested in the 2003 murder of Megan McDonald, whose baffling case featured on ""Dateline"" ahead of the solemn 20-year anniversary of her death. NBC New York's Chris Jose reports.

In a statement, the McDonald family said they are ""disappointed with today's news regarding the release of Edward Holley. However, his temporary release was expected. Since Megan was brutally taken from us, we have been advocating for the arrest of the person responsible for her murder. After patiently waiting for over 20 years, we are confident that the police have arrested the right person — Edward Holley. The process may not be easy or follow our preferred path, but we will not rest until justice is secured for Megan.”

Holley denied the allegations.

""I'm definitely not guilty,"" an orange jumpsuit-clad Holley said in handcuffs, as troopers pushed his wheelchair from the barracks toward a waiting car last week. ""I loved her with all my heart...They’re framing me like some monkey, but it’s all good.""

When asked by NBC New York what he wanted to say to McDonald's family, Holley said, ""I didn't do it. I loved Megan."" Two women in the crowd showed their support for Holley.

At the time of Holley's arrest, McDonald's family didn't mince words after police announced the break in the case.

""He forever will be billed a monster and a coward,"" said James Whalen, McDonald's brother-in-law. ""Do not let his current appearance fool you. This is a vile human being.""

McDonald's body was discovered on March 15, 2003, in a field in Wallkill, just outside the city of Middletown. Her car, a white Mercury Sable, was found two days later in a parking lot in the Kensington Manor Complex, also in Wallkill.

McDonald, who lived in Orange County, was a 20-year-old SUNY Orange County Community College student at the time of her death and had worked at the Galleria Mall in Middletown. She died of blunt force trauma.

Her father was a retired NYPD detective who died in 2002, a year before McDonald was killed -- and the NYC Detectives' Endowment Association had offered a $10,000 reward, as did the FBI, for information leading to her killer.

A Decades-Old Mystery

McDonald's story was the subject of a ""Dateline"" last year in which detectives discussed the latest developments in the case. McDonald had a conversation with two people she knew who were throwing a birthday party in Wallkill, near Greenway Terrace. They supposedly tried to get her to join and she refused.

Detectives told Dateline that people who attended the party later reported those two people had come back -- and told the rest of the group McDonald left to spend time with other friends in Middletown.

She ended up at her friend's home there and stayed until about midnight, according to the Dateline report. She told her friend she had to go home because she had to get up early for work in the morning, detectives told Dateline.

The friend didn't see her again, and detectives told Dateline McDonald apparently went back to that party instead of going home. She left pretty quickly, telling two other friends she was going to hang out with ""somebody,"" detectives told Dateline. According to the report, they watched her drive away. That was likely the last time she was seen alive.

In a later interview, an initial witness had a new detail, New York State Police Det. Brad Natalizio told Dateline -- a vehicle with a loud sound system that had been seen behind McDonald's car. The witness only noticed it because the volume was so loud, according to the Dateline report. It was likely a dark car that looked like a Honda Civic hatchback.

McDonald's family had just started to worry when they hadn't heard from her, and she didn't show up for work on March 14, 2003. The next day, Natalizio told Dateline the people who own property on Bowser Road called police to report a body. Investigators identified McDonald by her driver's license and say they believe she was killed in the field.

She had been murdered in her own driver's seat, Natalizio told Dateline.

Her father spent 20 years with the NYPD and did some homicide detective work there but died of a heart attack in 2002, McDonald's sister, Karen, told Dateline. He was 47 -- and she told the show that watching him work over the years made her confident the investigators working on her sister's case wouldn't give up until it's solved.

""Seeing what my dad would put into cases and how it affected him personally and the care that he brought to cases,"" Karen McDonald told Dateline last year. ""I feel for the police officers that have carried this for years for my sister. And I know that it's -- it's more, you know, it's -- it's personal to them at this point.""

There apparently had been a second suspect. That individual died.

Investigators have amassed nearly 1,000 pieces of evidence over the course of the 20-year probe, and Natalizio told Dateline the hope was that forensic advances in DNA technology would eventually lead to new leads.

It's not clear if that car was linked to Holley's arrest, but Kolek say his DNA was linked to a crime scene. Information on a possible attorney for him wasn't immediately available.

The individual who reported the fire told police they saw people ""causing damage"" inside the residence. Upon arrival, first responders found the remains of high schooler Maggie Long.

Investigators determined the fire to be arson, and the El Paso County Sheriff's Office (EPSO) found homicide to be Long's cause of death.

The FBI confirmed that at least one man was at Long's house when she died, stating that ""a physical altercation took place between Long and her assailants before the fire started.""

The assailants also took a Beretta handgun, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, a safe, jade figurines, and an AK-47-style rifle from the Long residence.

In 2021, 9News reported that the FBI had designated the murder of Long, an Asian American woman, as a potential hate crime. Since then, little information has come out about her case.

Thursday marks 50 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and there has been a marked shift in Moscow’s approach. Ukrainian officials have warned for days they expect a major offensive by Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region.

The US and EU have pledged a combined $1.3 billion more in military aid for Ukraine as Russia prepares to launch an eastern offensive.

Meanwhile, organizations like the United Nations have warned that the prolonged war in Ukraine could lead to more problems in an already struggling global economy with food insecurity as a top concern.

Here are the latest developments:

Casualties of war: As of April 12, the civilian death toll in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24 stood at 1,932, the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said Thursday. It warned that “the actual figures are considerably higher.”

Global impact: The United Nations secretary-general has warned that the world is on the brink of a “perfect storm” as the war in Ukraine exacerbates an already struggling global economy. In a news release Wednesday, the UN said the war could lead to a “three-dimensional crisis” of food, energy and finance — areas that have already been hit hard by Covid-19 and climate change. “We are now facing a perfect storm that threatens to devastate the economies of developing countries,” Secretary-General António Guterres said.”The people of Ukraine cannot bear the violence being inflicted on them. And the most vulnerable people around the globe cannot become collateral damage in yet another disaster for which they bear no responsibility,” he said.

Key Russian warship damaged: One of the Russian Navy’s most important warships has been badly damaged in the Black Sea, a massive blow to a military struggling against Ukrainian resistance 50 days into Russia’s invasion of his neighbor. Russian sailors evacuated the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, after a fire that detonated ammunition aboard, Russia’s defense ministry said. Ukraine’s Operational Command South claimed Thursday that the Moskva had begun to sink after it was hit Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. Russia’s defense ministry said Thursday that the Moskva “remains afloat” and that measures were being taken to tow it to port. The ministry said the crew had been evacuated to other Black Sea Fleet ships in the area. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar that “there was an explosion” on the Moskva, but said the United States cannot say at this point if the ship was hit by a missile. Whatever the reason for the fire, analysts say it strikes hard at the heart of the Russian Navy as well as national pride, comparable to the US Navy losing a battleship during World War II or an aircraft carrier today.

Ukrainian National Security Advisor Oleksiy Danilov told CNN Thursday that the alleged strike on the cruiser was a very important mission for his country’s military and vowed there would be more such dramatic actions. “It is a very important mission for us. The Moskva was there near the Snake Island and was hit yesterday by two powerful Ukrainian-made missiles,” Danilov told CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen in an interview. “[Putin] came to kill our children, our women, our civilians. That is our gift to him. And this is just the beginning. There will be more than one Moskva.” The Ukrainian national security advisor went on to commend the Ukrainian military for the way they were defending the country but cautioned against underestimating the Russian military. Danilov also reiterated his country’s request for the international community to send more weapons. “We are, first of all, grateful for what we already have been given,” he said “We need helicopters, planes, powerful weapons, howitzers… We need a lot.”

Potential meeting between Zelensky and Putin: Turkey is still working on organizing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told Turkish news channel NTV on Thursday.“We know critical topics will be decided at leader level, so we will try to bring leaders together,” he said. Cavusoglu said that Turkey continues to approach the negotiations with “cautious optimism,” particularly after recent events of alleged war crimes in Bucha and Irpin which “negatively affected the process.”

The condition for a possible meeting between Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky is an agreement document ready for the two leaders to sign, the Kremlin said Thursday. Since the start of Russia’s invasion, Zelensky has repeatedly called for talks with the Russian president, but there have been no talks at the highest level so far.

Russian opposition figure urges the West to wage a social media against Putin regime: Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny has issued a series of tweets urging a new front of “truth and free information” against Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he calls the “war criminal from the Kremlin.”

Navalny, who is serving a nine-year sentence in a Russian penal colony after being convicted of fraud last month, said in his tweets that “truth and free information hit Putin’s insane regime just as hard as Javelins,” the US anti-tank weapons being used by Ukrainian forces against Russian armor.

Increased international defense aid for Ukraine: The Pentagon is working to move the $800 million worth of weapons, ammunition and other security assistance for Ukraine announced by US President Joe Biden yesterday into Ukraine as quickly as possible, a senior defense official said Thursday. “We’re under no illusion of the size and the scale of this thing. But we’re also mindful of the clock. We know time is not our friend. And we’re going to do the best we can to move this, to move these shipments as fast as we can,” the official told reporters during an off-camera briefing.

The European Union has approved an additional 500 million euros ($544 million USD) for military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Wednesday, according to a news release from the European Council of the European Union.

“The next weeks will be decisive. As Russia prepares for an offensive on the East of Ukraine, it is crucial that we continue and step up our military support to Ukraine to defend its territory and population and prevent further suffering,” said Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.",Q3

CONNECTICUT — Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Stefanowski clarified some of his positions on abortion and vowed not to try and change state law.

“Under no circumstances will I as governor attempt to change the existing law,” Stefanowski said in a statement. “A woman’s right to choose has been, is, and will remain codified in Connecticut State Law, including Connecticut’s ban on late-term abortions - except in the case where the mother’s health is at risk.” Stefanowski released the statement the day after Gov. Ned Lamont criticized him for not saying more on the issue of abortion. Lamont signed Connecticut’s reproductive rights bill into law Tuesday.

The law allows physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses to perform aspiration abortions. It also limits information physicians and state officials can share in an effort to thwart out-of-state abortion lawsuits. State Rep. Laura Devlin, Stefanowski’s lieutenant governor running mate, voted in favor of expanding abortion access in the state at the end of the legislative session.

Lamont also said he was in favor of adding abortion rights to the state constitution. “Elections matter, and who knows what happens in five years,” Lamont said at the abortion bill signing ceremony. “Plus, if you have a different governor, you have a different legislature, different people appointed to the court.

On Deadline: White House, the host ripped Republicans who have governed on platforms which offer parents a choice regarding what is in their children’s curriculum. Wallace said the political rhetoric surrounding such efforts is meant to “dehumanize” the opposition, which she argued is a tactic Russians use in war.

The Bulwark’s Tim Miller invoked Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), whose state has banned teachers from discussing gender ideology or sexuality with elementary school students. Florida has also banned math books that mention race, gender ideology, or sexual orientation.

Miller argued Democrats should not allow Republicans to “define the debate around protecting your kids from sexualization,” and not allow them to call their opponents “groomers” — a popular term on the right for pedophiles.

Wallace agreed with Miller, and in her response, slammed a number of elected Republicans by name. She also equated the culture war over race, sexuality, and gender ideology in schools to a “dehumanization” campaign.

“You and I even fall into a tradition of a profession of focusing on what works, and I think we recently had a conversation about Mitch McConnell, and why does he do what he does, because it works,” Wallace said.

After she complained about the success of some conservative messaging on the subject, she ripped Republicans.

“I worry that in covering Glenn Youngkin and his politics of parental choice, all the focus was on how well it worked, and even in our conversations about DeSantis, it’s about how well they’re serving him,” she said.

Wallace then likened Republican culture war tactics to “dehumanization” campaigns, such as those seen in Russia’s military.

The truth is, dehumanization as a tactic for politics is from war. Dehumanization it’s a tactic, speaking of right now, the Russians get the soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them. Dehumanization, as a practice, is a tactic of war. It’s being deployed in our politics, and people like you and I sometimes lose the plot.

https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/american-orphans-in-the-wasteland/,American Orphans in the Wasteland,"On this Memorial Day, we hope you’ll appreciate revisiting this feature from our January/February issue.

We strode through the rubble of West Raqqa, a section of the city recently wrested from ISIS that July of 2017. Rifle shots echoed through the streets. The shots were not, I thought, directed at us, half a dozen Americans, Syriac Christians, and Kurds, but we moved nonetheless toward the exchange of fire, toward a building held by Kurds from Qamishli, the frontline against ISIS. To reach it, we would have to sprint over an open area of street perhaps a hundred yards across. Before we got there, I slowed to take a photo. An American fighting with a Christian militia saw me slow and yelled, “It’s usually the last guy who gets hit.”

As we reached the street, I caught up to the others and we sprinted to the building, closer to ISIS yet somehow safer. We climbed the stairs toward the roof, part of which had been blown open by explosions days before, and from there watched the sunset amid sniper exchanges that grew infrequent in the gathering night. The young men interlocked arms at the shoulder and smiled for photos, delighted in one another’s company, delighted to cheat death another day.

It seemed that every man-made thing in Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates—the cradle of civilization—was a wasteland. Only the desert lay untouched. By its barren roads one came to Raqqa, the heart of what remained of the Islamic State, a site of torture, crucifixions, and worse. Raqqa had been a desert frontier city in antiquity; then a crossroads of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Persian empires; then the capital of the Caliph Harun al-Rushid, and lately of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That caliphate was slowly losing ground in bloody assaults by a makeshift army of unbelievers.

The place was emptied of most life, the pale buildings but skeletal remains of a city. Aside from some trapped civilians and ISIS hostages, those who remained were the Arab, Kurdish, and foreign soldiers of the Syrian Democratic Forces on the one side and the equally diverse forces of the Islamic State on the other. This was a country governed by no state and no order any westerner could comprehend, yet it was a frontier between good and evil. Here, also, were two Americans.

Nearly two years later, on May 2, 2019, I sat at my desk in Washington, D.C., and found in my email a picture in which that American, Kevin Howard, looked back to warn me not to stop lest I be hit by a sniper. His eyes were sunken and aloof, the obscured windows of a wounded soul. In the foreground was another American, Taylor “Doc” Hudson, who ran point, crouching down as he approached the open crossing. Kevin was 29 at the time, a former Marine who grew up in the foster care system in California, enlisted in the Marine Corps at 17, and served in Iraq. Doc was a soldier-medic in the SDF, also from California. Both Kevin and Doc saw reports of the horrors ISIS was inflicting on Yazidi women and children—rape, enslavement, mutilation, murder—and decided that this was their fight. “I couldn’t sleep after I saw what was happening to the Yazidis,” Doc told me in Raqqa.

They did not know each other in 2014 when ISIS conquered much of Mesopotamia, but their lives soon became bound up in war, a premodern war fought by soldiers from the four corners of the earth, tribesmen, conscripts, teenage orphans, ideologues and idealists, devout believers and sociopaths.

Each participant had a name—often several—to distinguish his war self from his other self. Kevin had been called “Kane” in the French Foreign Legion, “Zagros” by the Kurds of the YPG, and “Christian” in his new unit, the Syriac Military Council (MFS). That unit began with a handful of Christians but now included Muslims, both Arab and Kurd, and other ethnic and religious minorities. Taylor was known variously as “Paul” in the Foreign Legion, “Akkad” after the son of an Assyrian family who was killed when ISIS overran the Khabur river region in 2015, and “Doc,” as he prefers to be called by those who knew him in Syria.

Soldiers on all sides assumed noms de guerre, usually linked to their places of origin. Kevin and Doc’s war names were not, but neither was that place altogether irrelevant, at least in my mind. In travels around the region, Americans from the West coast, especially California, seemed to turn up in the most unexpected places. There was the tall, young Arab man in traditional attire who approached me in Sa’ana, Yemen, to ask in unaccented American English where I was from. He was from California. Then there was the American who had joined ISIS and worked in their Mosul headquarters, then disappeared as the fighting intensified in 2016; he too was from California. There were others. Why did they always seem to be from the western edge of the continent?

Frederick Jackson Turner argued that it was the frontier that formed America’s institutions and the egalitarian mindset of those who conquered it. California was the place where the American frontier ended and the Pacific began. The errand into the continent’s vast wilderness of forests, deserts, and mountains began in the backcountry of Appalachia and spanned the continent to the Pacific. It was there, amid cruel nature and primitive violence, that the American sense of liberty took form, that second sons forged new destinies or perished, that fallen men were made anew. The American frontier not only shaped the character of its citizens but captured the imagination of people around the world.

The American West was a place where bastards and orphans might be redeemed, where good and evil flourished at extremes and in close proximity. The settling of California may have marked the end of the frontier, but not of its underlying spirit—the wanderlust, adventurism, and idealism.

By the time Kevin and Doc were born, there was little in California to test one’s mettle. It was by then synonymous with extravagance, comfort, and perhaps, above all, vanity. But they decided to pursue the ancient test of manhood—war—and to do so against the unequivocal evil of their day. It’s not so easy to distinguish or even perceive good and evil amid the bourgeois comfort and postmodern values of contemporary America. The fight against ISIS offered precisely that stark dichotomy. In that fight, they were prepared to stake all.

***

And so the two sons of California made their way to the deserts of Mesopotamia, compelled by idealism, brokenness, adventure, redemption, madness—any and all of the above. They traded in the comforts of the domesticated frontier for the austerity of the desert, for millennia a place of purification and preparation, a liminal space between the before and after, where one shed his identity and assumed another. Or a place to confront temptation and evil. It was also a place for healing. Even the soldier might find in the desert that which in every generation draws prophets and monks: clarity of mind and spirit. It was the same for Kevin and Doc, and for those whom they fought beside and against, whose ancestors had also gone into the desert to find meaning, though they spoke different languages and professed different creeds.

They were better prepared than many who fought there. Kevin had served in combat with the Marine Corps in Iraq, where he was wounded, and had some sense of what to expect. SDF units were ethno-linguistically and ideologically diverse and this inhibited communication and coordination. They were also less well-equipped than the U.S. military. But Kevin was used to hardship from childhood. He told me in Raqqa that he was an orphan, that much of his youth was spent in a boys home. There was an intensity with which he conveyed the name: “The Hanna Boys Center.” He paused and pointed at the notebook as I wrote, a deliberate gesture that I pondered later. When he came of age, he served in the Marine Corps and, after a brief incarceration, the Foreign Legion.

Doc had little military training besides familiarity with weapons. His primary role in the SDF was as a medic, since he had some medical training. He also had joined the Foreign Legion but like Kevin did not stay long. His own upbringing was more stable than Kevin’s: two parents whom he knew and an education at private schools. The two met in Syria in 2016 and fought in several battles together against ISIS.

One of the largest militia groups in the SDF was the YPG, a secular Marxist offshoot comprised heavily of progressive-minded Kurds. Kevin and Doc were quickly disillusioned with the YPG. “If you can get people to die for atheism, you have a frightening ideology,” Doc told me in 2017. They left the YPG for the MFS, a smaller but growing unit within the U.S.-backed SDF. The Syriac unit imposed no ideology and as a result attracted diverse recruits. But the YPG Kurds were consummate fighters and Kevin and Doc admired them, especially the fearlessness with which they fought. The dark mystique of ISIS struck terror in hearts from Mesopotamia to North America. But these Kurds, like many Syriac soldiers, were unafraid of ISIS or death, and there was a freedom in that. Still, the MFS remained their unit, perhaps because there is more even to war than fighting.

By the time I met them in 2017, Kevin and Doc were masters of their craft. They had survived the Battle of Tabqa Dam months earlier and were now in West Raqqa, where the SDF had participated in brutal urban combat earlier that summer. After weeks of relative calm, there was a skirmish one morning after an ISIS suicide bomber attacked an SDF position, followed by intense exchanges of fire and larger ordnance. Kevin spoke afterward of the “fog” that takes over, in which the context of the moment fades and the combatant goes on autopilot. It is a common feature of war that science has only recently begun to understand. In these moments, the amygdala, sensing danger, commands the hypothalamus to release adrenaline—the “fight or flight hormone”—into the bloodstream. A kind of rush ensues. The long-term effects on the brain and nervous system are harmful, but in the instant moment it fuels a kind of euphoria. All of this occurs in split seconds, without conscious direction.

“At our first major battle in Raqqa, we fought for 30 hours straight,” says Doc. “When it’s over, your body aches and you crash. But at the time, you don’t really notice.” Humans are not designed for such protracted conditions. As with drugs, a person can become addicted to the exhilaration of the adrenaline rush. Also as with drugs, the crash that inevitably follows is often accompanied by a sense of shame, complicated by the presence of euphoria and trauma from the violence witnessed or inflicted. Many who survive violent trauma only find consolation in the company of others who’ve endured similar experiences; words invariably prove inadequate, but the sense of sharedness can alleviate the shame and loneliness. Afterward, many try to recapture that euphoria in drugs or alcohol or some other experience. In the process, they become isolated from family and friends, exiles within themselves, never again quite free but instead slaves to an experience in the past that they try to relive or redeem.

That intensity and burnout was already present in the eyes of the combatants of Raqqa. I wondered about ISIS, a few hundred yards away. Here were young men with anima, with life and spirit. Every branch of Abraham’s descendants was here fighting under some banner or other, exiles from their countries, even a few from America.

In Nineveh, in neighboring Iraq, I had seen where ISIS slept on stone floors in churches and tunneled deep into the earth to survive airstrikes. They destroyed tombstones and used statues of Christ and his mother for target practice. They strapped explosives to themselves and charged forth like the Gadarene herd, as if possessed by some primitive region of the mind where blood lust and libido dominandi reigned. “Creatures out of the Dark Ages have come marching into the present,” Orwell wrote of the Nazis, “and if they are ghosts they are at any rate ghosts which need a strong magic to lay them.” Creatures. Ghosts. That strong magic consisted of a blend of airstrikes and people like Kevin and Doc. In this war they flourished, lords of a stateless chaos.

This was not a war whose gentlemen victors and vanquished would later hold reunions at renowned battlefields or whose “no man’s land” would be crossed for a Christmas truce. In this war, no limits were set by standards of chivalry, nor did emissaries bear gifts for each camp’s king. Such pleasantries occurred even during the Crusades, but not here. This was total war, waged by drug-riddled jihadists, who weaponized drones and burrowed into the earth with shovels and desecrated cemeteries, an ancient pagan ritual in which the conqueror eradicates all memory of the ancestors of the vanquished—any trace that Yazidis and Christians ever dwelt there.

ISIS maximized the terror they inflicted on captives and adversaries. As the SDF closed on a hospital in Raqqa, ISIS held children up in windows in the hopes that the SDF might shoot at the movement, not able to discern the children at that distance. Around this time, the SDF learned that ISIS was welding families into buildings, concrete tombs above ground where the poor civilians were left to die of thirst or hunger or airstrikes. This revelation slowed the advance of the SDF, which sought to avoid civilian casualties. “You didn’t kick doors, because they’re booby trapped,” Doc recalled. “So we blew walls down with satchel charges. Some guys killed families who were welded in. It was incredibly savage. Those people are subhuman. All so that ISIS could report back that we were killing civilians for propaganda.” Despite this and similar tactics, the death toll of civilians was relatively low; the casualty rates among some SDF units, however, were staggeringly high. All of it was more than the mind can endure for long. Kevin and Doc had already endured it for more than a year.

About a month after we met in 2017, an ISIS drone-mortar hit their position in Raqqa. Doc suffered a traumatic brain injury and was hospitalized for several months. The ensuing blurred vision, dizziness, and a lack of depth perception made it impossible either to fight or serve as a medic. As Doc healed and Kevin increasingly showed the effects of exhaustion, compounded by his own traumatic brain injury from combat in the Marines, they began to question what they were doing there. All that once seemed clear was increasingly obscure. I’d told them at our parting, “You have to go home, and when you get there, you have to heal. You’ve done your part in this fight.” They didn’t agree or disagree; they seemed like brawlers who would welcome restraint from others but wouldn’t walk away voluntarily. It may be that they feared going home more than staying, that that which made them cling to this place was precisely what was destroying them. In the chaos and violence of this wasteland they at least had a telos.

But what awaited them at home? The former frontier was a land of strip malls and suburban plenty—an air-conditioned world designed to insulate persons from any discomfort and reality, however ugly. The identities Kevin and Doc had forged in Syria might dissipate in America, where they would be reabsorbed without differentiation. It seemed a choice between two wastelands. Part of them felt more at home in the desert frontier. But it wasn’t really home. Nor was home. Nevertheless, they decided to make their way back, through months of setbacks, negotiations, and border crossings, all during a war in Syria and a Kurdish push for independence in Iraq. They finally arrived, after a long journey, in America.

***

The first time Kevin Howard returned home, after his discharge from the Marine Corps, he went to a party where he saw his girlfriend with another man. Enraged, he drew a handgun, threatened the man, fired shots into the ceiling, and was subsequently arrested and served time. Infidelity haunts the imagination of the soldier far from home, so much so that an oral tradition of “Jody calls” has been around since at least World War II. (“Jody” is the dishonorable fellow back home who pursues the soldier’s girlfriend in his absence.) Generations of drill sergeants have used Jody cadences to dampen the homesickness or depression of trainees, to inure them to betrayal. Kevin’s girlfriend had been his first, but not his last experience of betrayal.

After they parted ways in the Middle East, Kevin and Doc didn’t see each other again until the summer of 2018. Doc returned to Tucson, Kevin to the Bay Area, where he’d grown up. Kevin was nearly penniless when he got back from Syria and soon left the Bay Area for Montana and then the Dakotas to work in the oil fields. He worked the fire season in Oregon before returning once more to the Bay Area, where he tried to get housing from Veterans Affairs. When he was informed that the wait would be six months, Kevin landed on the streets. He called Doc, who sent him what money he had (a few hundred dollars) and told him to come to Tucson. Kevin came and Doc found space for him.

Kevin carried with him a list of things he wanted to do in his life, one of which was to own a house. To share in Doc’s house in Tucson meant a great deal to him. Kevin also found a girlfriend and for a time seemed to believe that assimilation into civilian life might be possible, even imperative. But there was another part of him that longed for what they had left behind. The frontier wilderness beckoned, with its war and chaos, its terrible euphoria and moral clarity and purpose. Kevin had wounds from the Middle East but also from childhood, untreated through his life, unhealed by the years.

Around the time Kevin was making his way back from Syria, news stories began to break in California about sexual abuse at the Hanna Boys Center. The abuse took place over a period of fourteen years, which overlapped with Kevin’s time there. Kevin seethed with anger when the center came up; Doc suspected that he had suffered abuse there, or perhaps earlier in life.

The return to America was hard for Doc, too. His place in Tucson was in the flight path of the local Air Force base, and when planes flew over in the night (especially the A-10), he lay in bed and shook. He often remained in his room in the first months back. “There would be days without any sleep and then I’d sleep 20 hours straight,” he recalled. Doc weighed the idea of using land bequeathed to him to start a desert retreat for combat veterans. Kevin, ever prone to swings, urged Doc to make it a place to train for military deployments of the kind they’d joined in Syria. Doc had no interest in this. Syria was peculiar because of the evil nature of the Islamic State and the anarchic context of the war. Kevin resented the rebuff.

In the spring of 2019, Kevin came to believe that he may have been dispossessed of money owed to him by a relative. Those around him sensed that something was wrong with him. “That’s when he started talking about Myanmar,” said Doc. There was a conflict in Myanmar and Kevin considered going there to join a militia—another adventure. Doc discouraged him, noting that it was a very different war than the one in Syria. Kevin barely left his room in the week that followed. “It was easy for him to feel betrayed,” Doc reflects.

Then came the blow upon a bruise. Kevin suspected that his girlfriend had been unfaithful. For the second time, he’d fallen in love, and for the second time, he’d been betrayed. He told a Marine friend with whom he’d served in Iraq that he was contemplating suicide.

In the early evening of April 30, 2019, Kevin went into the mountains just west of Tucson, to a place on Tumamoc Hill. He took a shotgun with him. Tumamoc was adjacent to Sentinel Peak. He ascended by a circuitous path over igneous rocks and found a stone alcove on the hill’s face from which he could peer down into Tucson on the broad valley plain below. There he erected a wall of loose rocks from the hill to conceal himself.

On these hills, Spanish sentinels stood watch centuries before and before them Native Americans, the lookouts of ancient peoples whose names and histories are long since lost. Perhaps the view reminded him of the deserts of Mesopotamia, where he had defined himself against the evil of his day and fought that evil unto exhaustion. Or perhaps the view reminded him of California, of the childhood he never had and the absence of which he never mourned. In the valley below was the civilization he fought to protect, a world that had already forgotten ISIS. Beyond the city were mountains and desert, much like the place where he found, for a time, identity and meaning. Some remnant of that desert lay trapped beneath the highways, office parks, and concrete lots. Whatever his own part in the war against the ISIS caliphate, waged in another desert now far away, that fight was over. And here was desert all around but no more frontier, and no place for him in the civilization below. He had no hope of healing nor of belonging anywhere. He posted his intentions along with a photo of his view on social media.

In Oregon, Kevin’s former Marine gunnery sergeant saw his post. As Tucson police scrambled to figure out where Kevin was and determine whether the armed veteran was a threat to more than himself, the gunnery sergeant cross-referenced the image Kevin posted to geolocate his position outside Tucson. A call went out on the internet to help a brother Marine in need.

***

Stefan Rivenbark did not know the name Kevin Howard when he rose in Tucson that last day of April. He returned home from work that evening and saw on a Marine Corps message board that another Marine in Tucson was contemplating suicide. He raced in his truck toward the hills.

Rivenbark approached the police checkpoint after sundown and was turned away at the entrance to Sentinel Peak, where Doc had already been searching for hours. Rivenbark looked at the peak opposite Sentinel. “Can I search that hill?” he asked. The officer gave her assent and Rivenbark scrambled up Tumamoc Hill. At one point, he got within thirty yards of Kevin, though he did not know it. He called out in the darkness. “Kevin Howard, this is Sergeant Stefan Rivenbark, United States Marines. Can you hear me?” Kevin did not respond. The search continued.

“I was up there,” Doc recalls. “I think he knew I was up there. I hope he knew that people who cared about him were looking for him. That he wasn’t alone.” Whatever his tortured thoughts, in the night on that hillside in the desert, Kevin Howard despaired.

Doc heard three shots, Rivenbark heard two. Doc sprinted down from Sentinel Peak and across the loose rocks and the cactus-filled gap toward Tumamoc, while Rivenbark, much closer, turned toward the shots and climbed again toward the place where he’d been before, but he was stopped by the police. As each met the police, they asked, “Did you shoot him?” They had not. Kevin’s first shot (or two) were apparently fired so that the searchers could find him.

There he lay contorted among the rocks in the darkness for two hours before they found the body of Kevin Howard: Marine, convict, Legionnaire, Syriac militiaman, American, orphan. He lived in abandonment, betrayal, trauma, and violence. He died in much the same way, but not entirely alone.

***

Neither Doc nor Rivenbark slept that night. After the shots, they were escorted down by the police and waited for nearly two hours before the police confirmed that Kevin was dead. After a few sleepless hours, they returned to Tumamoc Hill and searched for the place where Kevin died. When they finally found it, they saw where his deoxygenated blood had blackened the crimson rocks, part of his skull, part of his brain, and a pair of gloves left behind in the night by the police. As they stood there, the sun rose. Pitiless time marched on.

Two years later, on Memorial Day weekend 2021, I stand with Doc and Rivenbark just below Tumamoc. Rivenbark has the bearing of a Marine, tall and stoic, though this conceals the sense of duty and compassion that brought him here two years before. “I still have anxiety when I look up at this mountain,” says Rivenbark. We make our way up. It’s late in the day and the sun is setting behind Tumamoc as it did the night they searched for Kevin. It takes some time to find the spot but we eventually arrive at the stone alcove.

We stand for a long time in silence and look alternately at the ground and the valley below. The silence is broken only by brief words as the men relive that night in 2019. “I’ve thought about every scenario,” says Doc. “What if I got within a few feet, could I have stopped him then?” Minutes pass. “I thought about it for months after,” says Rivenbark. “What if I’d gotten here sooner?” We look out upon Tucson, at the fading daylight that stretches across the valley. Another lengthy silence is broken as Doc begins to weep. Rivenbark wraps an arm around him.

If Kevin had known the harm his suicide would cause, might he have gone back down the mountain? The memory of his courage on the battlefield is tarnished by this final, irrevocable act of violence, against himself, which harmed his closest friend and his brother Marines, even this stranger who searched for him in that darkness, a darkness not of his making.

When Rivenbark returned to this place after a sleepless night two years before, he saw how close he’d come to Kevin. He pondered it all again now. “I still have nightmares,” says Rivenbark. “I can smell the blood. Part of his skull on the fucking ground. The fact that they could leave that behind…” Like so many veterans, Rivenbark’s service didn’t end when he left the Marine Corps: his worst trauma came not in his part of a generation-long war in the Middle East but on a desert hill near his native Tucson. Now nightmares and fellowship bring him back to this place. It’s not the war he imagined when he enlisted, a very different kind of sentinel among the crags and cactuses.

When it is nearly dark, the three of us make our way down Tumamoc Hill.

***

“Do you remember that photograph from Raqqa,” Doc asks me at his house in Tucson, the same day we went up Tumamoc Hill. “The one with us and all the Kurds?” I tell him that I do. “You and I are the only ones alive from that picture.” He nods slowly, as if to drive home an implausible truth. “Everyone else is dead.” In the photo were Kevin and several Kurds, and a smiling Doc. A few weeks before we met in Arizona, another young American who fought with him in the SDF died of a drug overdose, by no means the first. Old comrades from the war against ISIS continue to die in the safety of America.

Doc’s house is an adobe structure whose perimeter is lined with chain-linked fence and signs that warn of dogs and security cameras. He greets me at the iron gate, gaunt and bearded, with camouflage fatigues loose on his thinned frame. He has aged far beyond the four calendar years since I met him and Kevin in Raqqa. We enter his house and sit in a cool room illumined only by light from the adjoining kitchen and cracks under the door. In the grey light, it feels like Mesopotamia long before conversation takes us back there.

“Kevin told me it’d be hard coming home,” he says. “I had no idea.” The combination of PTSD and the traumatic brain injury he suffered in Syria causes seizures and insomnia. “I’d take the worst day there over an average day here.” He pinpoints a type of trauma described by many veterans: fearlessness in the heat of battle, but terror felt far from the front when enemies struck unexpectedly. “Your expectations make all the difference. When ISIS is a few hundred meters away, you expect the worst.”

Once, while smoking cigarettes on a rooftop in Raqqa with an Arab man from the SDF, an ISIS sniper hit the Arab soldier in the head and his brains and blood splattered on Doc; a second later, the sound of the shot fired reached Doc’s ears. “It was horrific, and haunts me looking back, but it didn’t even get my heart rate up in the moment. But here when I hear a firecracker, I panic.”

The experience of terror combined with a sense of helplessness often traumatizes, setting the fight-flight-freeze response on a hair trigger in everyday life. “For me, I just function better in a war zone,” he says. “Maybe it’s because parts of my brain shut down that don’t otherwise function properly.” Neuroscience suggests this is precisely what happens.

Doc finds himself today in a third wasteland, not Mesopotamia or the American frontier but that of the traumatized mind. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, psychiatrist and leading scholar-practitioner of trauma treatment, writes in The Body Keeps Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma, “We have learned that trauma is not just an event that took place sometime in the past; it is also the imprint left by that experience on the mind, brain, and body. This imprint has ongoing consequences for how the human organism manages to survive in the present.”

The traumatic imprint thus becomes an inescapable feature of one’s psychological landscape, as much a part of the present as the rocky hills above Tucson. It also becomes the only reality in which the person feels alive. “Somehow the very event that caused them so much pain has also become their sole source of meaning,” writes van der Kolk. “They felt fully alive only when they were revisiting their traumatic past.” This is a common paradox of trauma, and the addictive rush of war: one feels trapped in a nightmare from which he seeks to escape, even while he tries to escape back into the nightmare to feel alive. The traumatized mind might even regard attempts to heal it as a threat, since to heal would be to part with the hypervigilance upon which one’s safety depends.

Trauma is not a past event for people like Kevin and Doc, nor millions of others. It resides and recurs constantly in the mind, where terrifying sensations experienced during the traumatic event replay in an endless loop. Neuroscience suggests that the traumatized brain cannot contextualize the experience by placing it safely in the past. So such people remain trapped in a nightmare from which they cannot escape and perhaps do not wish to awaken, for only in high intensity situations or in the process of re-traumatization do they feel fully present. The traumatic past thus becomes timeless, a hellish present without end.

It is a bitter irony that Kevin and Doc sought in the violent wilderness of Mesopotamia a telos that would deliver them from before into the after, only to arrive in a psychological wasteland where time halted and pain was perpetual. The relived trauma is stripped of a sense of time or forward progression. As psychiatrist and researcher Iain McGilchrist writes in The Master and His Emissary, brain damage, like trauma, can interrupt “temporal sequencing” or the “temporal flow,” which results in decontextualized fragments of experience. The sensations and intensity of the traumatic experience are relived over and over, consciously and unconsciously, amid the light of day. We are conditioned to think of Hell as a place where torments are inflicted, with the absence of time as only a secondary feature. But the cessation of time can itself be the worst affliction, akin to the absence of reason or hope. Clock time becomes the illusion, the violent experience the present reality.

The only way out of this wasteland is to restore context to the experience, to put it in the past and thus restore the temporal flow and with it context and then, perhaps, reason and meaning. This is the work of therapies like EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), a relatively new treatment that works by a process of lateralization that jars loose traumatic experiences from memory loops in order to allow the brain to contextualize them: That was Syria in 2017, but it’s in the past; I survived it and am safe here. Patients often experience EMDR as a process in which they are a passive observer; the therapist’s role is to help the patient’s brain to heal itself. Doc says EMDR helps him.

Doc knows that the wilderness he must survive, the human brain, has only begun to be mapped. It is traversed by other survivors, most of whom wander without awareness of the other sojourners. The more we learn, the better hope there is for people like Doc. He finds consolation in the other wanderers, especially military veterans. He notes that many of them also miss the intensity of a combat zone, particularly the sense of purpose that comes from fighting evil. The vets with whom he speaks, especially friends of Kevin’s, accept him as one of their own. Perhaps they understood that the war against ISIS was fought primarily not by soldiers of recognized states but by men like Kevin and Doc, soldiers of no nation. They also understand the struggle ahead will not be against evil on a battlefield but in the mind, against trauma, depression, and despair.

***

The day after his suicide in 2019, I looked at that picture of Kevin Howard from the seventh floor of the State Department and felt as far removed as one could be from the lawless roads of Mesopotamia and the polyglot militias warring on its frontiers. “It’s usually the last guy who gets hit,” he warned. It occurred to me that perhaps it had been a mistake to tell Kevin to go home. Maybe the real wasteland wasn’t the rubble of the Islamic State or the Syrian desert; maybe it was California. Maybe Kevin belonged in that strange place where he found a purpose, a telos, however alien or absurd it may seem to most of his peers, however dangerous. Maybe it was sufficient unto a life to kill evil men who raped, enslaved, and murdered. Maybe that’s more than most of us will accomplish in a lifetime.

I sat there in a prolonged silence, like the silence I would experience on Tumamoc two years later with two good men—in that place beyond words where we contemplate the chasm between what is and what ought to be, where we reason by means beyond our capacity for expression.

America ran out of frontier but not frontiersmen. The original frontiersmen sought adventure at the extremes of the New World, its chaos and violence. In the lawlessness of the Middle East, people like Kevin and Doc sought to rediscover something of that life. In the midst of chaos and violence there seemed to be a power to remake the wanderer. Kevin was a frontier orphan without roots in either blood or soil but drawn to the frontier itself. He sought the wilderness and whatever freedom or redemption he might find there—and fled deeper wounds from childhood about which we can only speculate. But the land in which he fought and bled wasn’t a destination—only one form of the wasteland in which he was trapped. The frontier was always the next, unrealized thing. Myanmar. Another war, another frontier, ever-elusive redemption and healing, permanence and meaning, a sentinel’s post in an ancient desert.

There are more Kevins than we care to imagine. Men and women who from childhood survive trauma and neglect and abuse only to remain trapped in a perpetual, hellish present. Some find themselves in the military or law enforcement or some similar role, only to discover that there is too often no place for them in the world they protect. They wander in a wilderness of sorts, not a place of preparation or purification but a lonely wasteland in which they master the craft of survival but little else. Some, like Kevin, do not survive—even as neuroscience and therapy offer healing that for a fortunate few seems miraculous.

War and trauma and the many harsh realities of existence are familiar to our primitive selves. Everything about suburban bourgeois existence is designed to separate us from those realities. But to some that existence feels like a lie. This, at least in part, is why young men run from it, into the wilderness, into war, into alcohol and opioids. To them the lie is less tolerable than whatever may happen in the wilderness.

Christian schoolchildren are taught that God will never burden a soul with more than it can bear. As we grow older, we discover sooner or later that this, too, is a lie, likely born of the same need to take refuge from reality. Perhaps God, if he’s there at all, has a greater capacity for mercy than the cosmos has for misery.

Now, police have finally identified her husband as the killer. And he is long-deceased himself.

On April 20, 1998, a body was found on state Route 276 near Maidenwater Spring in Garfield County, Utah. Investigators discovered a precise and intricate method of disposal. The then-unknown woman was bound with rope, wrapped in plastic bags covered in duct tape, placed inside of a sleeping bag, and stuffed inside of a rolled up carpet.

The Garfield County Sheriff’s Office and the Utah State Bureau of Investigation shared investigatory duties. But the case went cold.

In late 2018, police in Youngstown, Ohio updated their missing persons registry with an image of Reyes-Geddes from Immigration and Customs Enforcement — the first photo of the woman the agency had ever possessed, according to Salt Lake City NBC affiliate KSL-TV. She disappeared in 1998 after leaving on a trip from Ohio to Mexico by way of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the story long went. It was unknown for years, however, if she ever made it to Texas.

Meanwhile, Utah investigators were publicly getting the case wrong in an effort to link the death of the woman known as the “Maidenwater victim” to convicted serial killer Scott “Hannibal” Kimball.

“At this point, there are a lot of similarities between this victim and his other victims, in the cause of death, things that have occurred to their body after death, the way they were packaged, the way they were hidden and discarded,” Utah State Bureau of Investigation agent Brian Davis said during a press conference that was held shortly after an episode of Dateline ran that focused on Kimball’s reign of terror.

Less than a month later, the one agency’s belated (but publicized) efforts combined with the second agency’s highly-publicized mistake about Kimball — and a true crime aficionado in California finally linked the two cases together. That citizen contacted Davis, sent along a picture, and suggested the police look into a possible connection.

After conferring with police in Ohio, investigators located a relative of the long-missing woman. Two family members traveled to the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey, Mexico to provide DNA samples. The results came back and Reyes-Geddes was no longer a woman solely identified by the place where her body had been dumped.

With progress on the case came another public misstep.

The Garfield County Sheriff’s Office quickly posted a Facebook update saying “the suspect of this murder committed suicide in Nevada in the early 2000s,” according to a November 2018 report by KSL-TV.

Davis rejected the local law enforcement take.

“From our standpoint . . . we don’t consider him a suspect at this time,” he said. “There’s a misunderstanding there.”

Edward Geddes eventually did become a suspect. But his body was cremated after he killed himself in Nevada in 2001, making identification time-consuming. Law enforcement requested DNA from his surviving blood relatives, and two of them agreed. A search warrant was used to get DNA from a third family member, KSL-TV reports.

The rope found on Reyes-Geddes’ body contained DNA that did not belong to her. That DNA was pulled using a special sort of wet suction device that extracts genetic material from items that are relatively porous. The DNA found on the rope was a familial match for each of the husband’s three relatives.

Another roadblock appeared, however, as the DNA of an additional man was found on the rope. The DNA was eventually unmixed, the TV station reports, and the second man’s DNA showed another surprise: a link to a murder out of Montana. That wrinkle was pressed down after police determined the second man was a knot expert who had accidentally contaminated the evidence.

Only the husband remained.

“To have this answer finally after 24 years is incredible,” David told KSL-TV. “And I know it’s not the answer that (her sister) would have wanted when she found her sister . . . but they had suspected. In fact, quite frankly, their family thought that Edward had done something to her. They just hadn’t proved it . . . . That was always their hunch.”

Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) said that June 8 marks the 14th anniversary of the enforced disappearance of Zakir Majeed Baloch. It has been 14 years since Baloch student leader Zakir Majeed Baloch was forcibly kidnapped and 'disappeared' by the Pakistani security forces. Zakir Majeed's family will hold a protest in front of Quetta Press Club today against his long enforced disappearance, reported VBMP. Baloch students, no matter whether they are in Balochistan or any other part of Pakistan, always live in the fear of being abducted, tortured, and killed. They cannot roam around freely or take part in normal activities like other students. Most of the time Baloch people become part of the struggle not because of a choice but because of the deprivation, oppression and brutal policies of the deep state. Pakistani forces may have been successful in banning the Baloch political parties on fake charges but they have not been successful in ending the Baloch resistance. The people's resistance is still ongoing and it is getting more powerful day by day. Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court has ordered the government to issue notices to all past executives from former president Pervez Musharraf to current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to explain what the court described as ""undeclared tacit approval of the policy regarding enforced disappearances."" The defence forces in Pakistan are widely accused of being responsible for the 'disappearance' of an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 persons, however, the exclusion of the military from the notice highlights its alleged role in the political turmoil of Pakistan. As per a local media report, the activists from Balochistan province are high on the list of the 'missing'. Baloch 'nationalists', forming many groups, have been fighting the state to oppose curbs on civil rights and the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects that they say deprive Balochs of natural resources while giving few jobs. According to Amnesty International, the commission received 3,000 cases of such disappearances. By 2021, the Commission reported that it has received 7,000 cases of forced disappearance since its inception and it has resolved around 5,000 of those cases. The issue of forced disappearance in Pakistan originated during the Musharraf era (1999 to 2008), but the practice continued during subsequent governments. Human rights activists allege that the law enforcement agencies in Pakistan are responsible for the cases of forced disappearance in Pakistan. Enforced disappearances are used as a tool by Pakistani authorities to terrorize people who question the all-powerful army establishment of the country, or seek individual or social rights. Cases of enforced disappearances have been majorly recorded in the Balochistan and the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces of the country which host active separatist movements. (ANI)",Q3

‘People Who Look Like Them’

State supreme courts wield power over many areas of American life, from school funding to environmental protection, gun laws to voting. Even as the United States population has become more diverse, state high courts have been the domain of White judges, attorneys and staff.Many still are: Nearly half the states don’t have a single justice identifying as a person of color.But a growing awareness of the lack of diversity is slowly leading to change. When Ketanji Brown Jackson becomes the first Black female justice in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 233-year history, three justices of color and four female justices will sit on the nation’s highest court.There’s a consensus that judges and justices from varied backgrounds instill public trust and confidence and bring perspectives that lead to more thoughtful decisions. Now, state supreme courts also are starting to look more like the people they serve.Sworn in this year so far: the first Black supreme court justice in Maine, the first female justice of color in Vermont, the first Latina justice in California and the first Hispanic high court judge in Maryland. They are Rick E. Lawrence (Maine), Nancy Waples (Vermont), Patricia Guerrero (California) and Angela M. Eaves (Maryland).“There have been some milestone appointments,” said Alicia Bannon, director of the judiciary program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning nonprofit at the New York University School of Law. “And we’ve seen incremental improvement, but it varies state to state.”Federal courts, especially the U.S. Supreme Court, receive intense media scrutiny, but state courts, which hear 95 percent of all cases filed in the United States, are more insulated. State court systems release little data about judges, justices or staff.Yet their decisions have significant effects on residents’ lives. State supreme courts often have the last word on election redistricting plans that determine how state legislative and congressional districts are drawn. They can levy—or throw out—huge fines on corporations, and rule on education funding, environmental issues, abortion rights and gun safety measures, among other concerns. They set precedents that bind more than 23,000 lower state court judges, according to the Brennan Center.As recently as last year, in 22 states no justices identified publicly as a person of color, including in 11 states where people of color make up at least a fifth of the population, according to a report by the Brennan Center.Of 339 sitting state supreme courtjustices around the country, only 58 were people of color, according to the center.Put another way, although about 40 percent of people living in the United States are non-White, only 17 percent of state supreme court justices are Black, Latino, Asian American or Native American.“When someone comes into court, it should not be a surprise to see an African American judge,” Delaware Chief Justice Collins Seitz Jr. said in an interview.Seitz has made a priority of addressing the lack of diversity in his state’s courts and legal profession. He is inspired by his late father, a trailblazing Delaware jurist who in 1950 ordered the desegregation of University of Delaware and two years later the desegregation of the state school system. The U.S. Supreme Court used Seitz’s reasoning in the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision.Gov. John Carney, a Democrat, appointed Seitz, who is White, as chief justice and Tamika R. Montgomery-Reeves as Delaware’s first Black female supreme court justice in late 2019.Last May, the Delaware Supreme Court announced a steering committee to study how to increase judicial diversity. In February, Seitz and Montgomery-Reeves released “Improving Diversity in the Delaware Bench and Bar Strategic Plan,” a report also intended as a model for other states.The 100-page report with 50 recommendations, thought to be the first detailed guide by any state on increasing judicial diversity, traces a lack of legal and judicial diversity to a pipeline problem: Fewer people of color go to college, and fewer still attend law school and become attorneys and judges. Law firms should reinforce partners’ engagement in mentorship programs to ensure attorneys of color have the support they need to advance in the profession, the report said.“A ‘whole of system’ approach is needed”—including boosting K-12 civics education, requiring attorneys to participate in implicit bias training and increasing outreach efforts to encourage qualified attorneys from diverse backgrounds to pursue a judicial career.Among the report’s recommendations is to collect better demographics on Delaware’s bar, a term for the attorneys licensed to practice law in a state, and on the bench, or courts.The lack of demographic data “inhibits the ability to understand the breadth of diversity challenges within the bar,” the report said, and that makes it difficult to design or evaluate outreach efforts.“Our state has a 28 percent [non-White] population, and we’d like to have the bench and bar reflect that population,” Seitz said.The Delaware Supreme Court also would like to hire a diversity, equity and inclusion coordinator; take oral arguments to high schools—as several states, including Indiana, Nebraska and Ohio, do; create newpathways for students of color to consider a legal career; and start a judicial mentorship program.Each state has a court of last resort that is usually, though not always, called the supreme court. States use various paths for selecting judges, including partisan or nonpartisan elections, gubernatorial appointments, commission-assisted gubernatorial appointments and legislative appointments.The Brennan Center found some ways governors can increase diversity: If a governor, for example, fills a judicial vacancy with a person of color before the next election, the incumbent often has a leg up at election time.Some officials say recruiting people of color is challenging.“We have a hard time recruiting minorities to our bench,” Laurie Givens, director of the Administrative Office of the Kentucky Courts, said in an interview. “We will always have problems recruiting unless we increase pay, especially in rural areas.”Kentucky’s system of electing state judges—by district, not statewide—has produced only one Black supreme court justice in history. William McAnulty Jr. was elected to the high court in 2006 and died of cancer in 2007.Kentucky ranks 53in salaries for associate justices of 55 states and territories, according to the National Center for State Courts. An 8 percent raise in the works for all Kentucky state employees may help, Givens said.In some states, candidates must give up their law practices for an appointment of just four to six years.Recruitment is difficult even in the District of Columbia, where the president appoints judges for 15-year terms and where district judgeships often lead to federal judgeships and other posts. Opportunities in the private sector can be far more lucrative. Large law firms in Washington and other major cities offer far higher salaries than public service. Starting salaries for attorneys at some New York firms top $200,000 a year.Salaries for associate justices of state supreme courts range from $120,000 to $274,732 with the median salary of $183,653, according to the National Center for State Courts.“A young partner at a law firm is walking away from a lot” to take a judgeship, Chief Judge Anna Blackburne-Rigsby of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals said in an interview. (The court of appeals in D.C. is the equivalent of a state supreme court.)Some critics argue having to run for election is a barrier to judicial diversity, but retired Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan Page is among those who favor elections. A standout defensive tackle on the NFL’s Minnesota Vikings, Page was the first Black justice on the Minnesota high court in the 1990s.“The only way I had an opportunity to serve was to be elected,” Page said in an interview.After the governor tried to extend a retiring justice’s term past the election date, thwarting Page’s goal of running for the court, Page filed a lawsuit in the Minnesota Supreme Court to get his name on the ballot in 1992. He won the election. Reelected three times, he served until 2015, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.He added that governors who make appointments “get people who look like them.”Page rejects the idea there are too few qualified candidates: “My experience is there are highly qualified, extremely talented people from diverse backgrounds here in Minnesota and in virtually every state. There may not be as many, but they’re there.”Two months after George Floyd was murdered by police in Minneapolis in May 2020, as protests erupted around the country, the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators adopted a resolution that said structural racism disproportionately affects people of color and erodes public confidence in the fairness of the judicial system.The resolution led to a 150-member working group of lawyers, judges and officials from legal organizations that is providing guidance for courts, called a Blueprint for Racial Justice.“The perception of fairness is as important as fairness itself. Public trust and confidence in the judicial process is vitally important,” said Blackburne-Rigsby of the D.C. Court of Appeals, a co-moderator of the Blueprint’s diversity work group.“When people see people who look like them in court, I think it helps,” she said.On the high-court level, where decisions are made by panels of three judges, having diverse perspectives leads to better decisions, Blackburne-Rigsby said. “Sometimes individuals can have blind spots, and discussions which bring diverse viewpoints to bear can help minimize blind spots.”Edwin Bell, a longtime court administrator in Georgia, was named director of racial justice, equity and inclusion at the National Center for State Courts in 2020.“Part of the challenge is an awareness of the lack of diversity and what the ways are to address it,” Bell said. “We’re not advocating for a quota system in any way, shape or form, but we do want to identify best practices.”The center wants to build an online job application portal for state court positions, similar to the portal federal courts around the country use to fill law clerk and staff attorney vacancies. Working with historically Black colleges and Hispanic groups, Bell hopes to have the state courts portal operational by the end of the year.Stateline",Q3

The Wall Street Journal has some updated information that is extremely disturbing.

TEXAS – […] “Victor Escalon, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a briefing that the now-deceased gunman, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, lingered outside Robb Elementary for 12 minutes firing shots before walking into the school and barricading himself in a classroom where he killed 19 children and two teachers.

Mr. Escalon said he couldn’t say why no one stopped Ramos from entering the school during that time Tuesday. Most of the shots Ramos fired came during the first several minutes after he entered the school, Mr. Escalon said. People who arrived at the school while Ramos locked himself in a classroom, or saw videos of police waiting outside, were furious.

“The police were doing nothing,” said Angeli Rose Gomez, who after learning about the shooting drove 40 miles to Robb Elementary, where her children are in second and third grade. “They were just standing outside the fence. They weren’t going in there or running anywhere.”

DPS officials previously said an armed school officer confronted Ramos as he arrived at the school. Mr. Escalon said Thursday that information was incorrect and no one encountered Ramos as he arrived at the school. “There was not an officer readily available and armed,” Mr. Escalon said.

A Border Patrol tactical team went into the school an hour later, around 12:40 p.m., was able to get into the classroom and kill Ramos, Mr. Escalon said.

Ms. Gomez, a farm supervisor, said that she was one of numerous parents waiting outside the school who began encouraging—first politely, and then with more urgency—police and other law enforcement to enter the school sooner. After a few minutes, she said, U.S. Marshals put her in handcuffs, telling her she was being arrested for actively intervening in an active investigation.

Ms. Gomez convinced local Uvalde police officers whom she knew to persuade the marshals to set her free. Around her, the scene was frantic. She said she saw a father tackled and thrown to the ground by police and a third pepper-sprayed. Once freed from her cuffs, Ms. Gomez made her distance from the crowd, jumped the school fence, and ran inside to grab her two children. She sprinted out of the school with them.

Videos circulated on social media Wednesday and Thursday of frantic family members trying to get access to Robb Elementary as the attack was unfolding, some of them yelling at police who blocked them from entering.

“Shoot him or something!” a woman’s voice can be heard yelling on a video, before a man is heard saying about the officers, “They’re all just [expletive] parked outside, dude. They need to go in there.”

Parents can be heard yelling to each other that their kids were inside the school and that they needed to get in. A woman can be heard yelling at a police officer, “He’s one person! Take him out!”

The Uvalde Police Department couldn’t be reached for comment. A representative for the U.S. Marshals Service didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Asked at the press conference why law enforcement weren’t able to respond in the initial 12 minutes Ramos was outside the school, Mr. Escalon said that was part of the investigation. “Our job is to report the facts and have answers. We’re not there yet,” he said. (read more)",Q3

Officers responded to a report of a man armed with a rifle at the St. Francis medical campus Wednesday afternoon, which ""turned into an active shooter situation."" During a news conference, Tulsa Police Department Deputy Chief Eric Dalgleish confirmed the number of dead and said the shooter also was dead, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

It was unclear what prompted the deadly assault.

""What happened today in Tulsa is a senseless act of violence and hatred,"" Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement. ""I am grateful for the quick and brave actions of the Tulsa Police Department and other first responders who did their best to contain a terrible situation.""

He added: ""I ask all Oklahomans to come together in support of the Saint Francis Health System community and to grieve with those whose lives have been forever changed.""

Dalgleish did not release the name of the suspected shooter, but police found that he had a rifle and a handgun, and said it appeared both weapons were fired at the scene.

St. Francis Health System locked down its campus Wednesday afternoon because of the situation at the Natalie Medical Building. Police said officers were going room-to-room in the building.

The Natalie building houses an outpatient surgery center and a breast health center. Dalgleish said at least part of the incident occurred at an orthopedic center on the second floor. People were asked to avoid the area.

""This campus is sacred ground for our community,"" Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum told reporters at the news conference. ""For decades, this campus has been a place where heroes have come to work every day to save the lives of people in our community.""

Bynum added: ""I would ask for you to think about what the St. Francis Health System and the people that work there mean to our community, what they mean to you and your family and your neighbors. The heroes who protect you.""

Police also believe the suspect may have planted a bomb at his residence in Muskogee, Oklahoma, about 50 miles southeast of Tulsa, officials said Wednesday night.

""At this time we have evacuated the house and have notified everyone in the area to stay inside their homes,"" Muskogee Police's public information officer, Lynn Hamlin, said.

An Oklahoma Highway Patrol bomb squad later cleared the home, finding no devices inside, Hamlin said.

Kevin Foristal, of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, waited for his wife at the designated reunification area at Memorial High School just over a block away from the hospital campus.

Foristal said his wife was receiving outpatient therapy at the infusion center in the main hospital building at the time of the shooting.

She told him hospital staff turned out the lights, locked the doors and covered windows with cardboard, Foristal said.

He said he is ""elated"" to have good news from his loved one, but ""there's people out there where that's not going to happen.""

The shooting in Tulsa comes after two high-profile shooting massacres in Buffalo, New York, where 10 Black people were killed, and Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two teachers were killed in May.

Lindsey Garner, a public defender for Larenzo L. Burnett, 20, asked 6th Judicial District Judge Ian Thornhill to lower the $50,000 bail on Burnett's involuntary manslaughter charge to $5,000 and allow Burnett to post 10 percent with the clerk's office. She also asked for other bail orders totaling $7,000 on two other charges be lowered.

Thornhill denied the requests.

Jodi Hendrickson, a probation officer with 6th Judicial Correctional Services, said based on Burnett's criminal history he was a flight risk and is accused of being involved in the death of a person.

Burnett had received probation for a 2019 conviction of intimidation with a dangerous weapon and had two violations during probation. He was sent to the Lary Nelson Center, a halfway house in Cedar Rapids, but escaped from there and removed an ankle monitor, Hendrickson said.

Burnett also has a pending burglary charge out of Michigan and has waived extradition.

Assistant Linn County Attorney Rena Schulte asked the judge to leave all three bail orders as set, saying Burnett was a flight risk and a danger to the community.

In the involuntary manslaughter incident, Burnett was waving a weapon around 18-year-old Marissa Doolin's face and accidentally discharged the gun when she tried to push it away while they were in an apartment at 2110 Westdale Dr. SW.

Police said Doolin was shot in the face and died Dec. 26 after being transferred from a Cedar Rapids hospital to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City.

Burnett also is accused of threatening a witness who was in the residence at the time, telling the person not to say anything, Schulte said. Both Burnett and the witness ran from the apartment after Doolin was shot. Doolin was found at 3:25 p.m., lying on the couch, the criminal complaint states.

Burnett is charged with involuntary manslaughter and tampering with a witness. He was already the Linn County Jail on the escape charge when arrested in Doolin's shooting.

Burnett and the witness - who is not named - initially told police Doolin was shot through a window by an unknown person, according to the complaint. But police said there was no damage to any windows and a single shell casing was found inside.

Two days after the shooting, Burnett in a phone call from the Linn County Jail, threatened the witness, saying don't talk to police and 'to be ready for whatever is coming to him,” according to police.

If convicted on both charges, Burnett faces up to seven years in prison.

Rep. Adam Smith (D., Wash.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, selected MSNBC pundit Jeremy Bash to serve on the Afghanistan War Commission. The commission will review the U.S. military's involvement in Afghanistan from June 2001 to August 2021, when President Joe Biden ordered all American troops to leave the country. Biden has come under fire for his inaccurate prediction that the Taliban was ""highly unlikely"" to regain control of Afghanistan in the absence of American forces.

Bash's selection could call into question whether the Afghanistan War Commission can conduct an unbiased investigation. Bash cheered Biden's announcement in April 2021 that he would remove troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. Months earlier, Bash signed an open letter with 50 former intelligence community officials that claimed Russia had likely released Hunter Biden's emails weeks before the 2020 election. The intel community veterans were responding to the New York Post's release of emails from a laptop that Biden allegedly abandoned at a computer repair shop more than a year earlier.

The officials said they did not have evidence that Russia was involved in the laptop release but that the disclosure had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""

Since the explosive claim, there has been no credible evidence linking Russia to the laptop. The owner of a computer shop in Delaware has said Biden dropped off his laptop for repairs in April 2019 and never retrieved it. Biden has said he was abusing drugs during the period when he allegedly abandoned his laptop.

The Justice Department is investigating Biden's foreign business dealings, many of which are discussed in emails found on the computer.

Bash also served as a chief of staff to the heads of the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Defense during the Obama administration.",Q3
https://www.algemeiner.com/2022/05/18/media-reality-check-jenin-is-the-epicenter-of-palestinian-terrorism/,Media Reality Check: Jenin Is the Epicenter of Palestinian Terrorism,"The Washington Post reported on May 16th about how a leading Catholic clergyman in Israel had condemned the events surrounding the funeral of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot and killed during a terrorism raid in the West Bank.

What went unmentioned in the entire piece is that Abu Akleh’s tragic death occurred in a terror hotbed, a place where most of the Palestinians who have carried out the recent terror attacks on Jewish civilians have come from.

Instead, The Washington Post has chosen to rebrand the city of Jenin as a mere “refugee camp.”

The Post piece covers the disagreements surrounding the exact circumstances of Abu Akleh’s death, by stating:

Israel and the Palestinians are locked in a war of narratives over Abu Akleh’s killing. The reporter, a Palestinian-American, a Catholic and a 25-year veteran of the satellite channel, was shot Wednesday while covering an Israeli military raid in the Jenin refugee camp. She was wearing a blue vest clearly marked “Press.” Abu Akleh was a household name across the Arab world, known for documenting the hardship of Palestinian life under Israeli rule. [Emphasis added]

The above reference to the “raid on the Jenin refugee camp” immediately followed by the description of Abu Akleh’s work focused on “documenting the hardship of Palestinian life under Israeli rule” is problematic for several reasons.

First, Jenin is not simply one big Palestinian refugee camp that Israeli authorities flagrantly invaded. Rather, the area around the city, including the UNRWA-run camp, has long been a hub for terrorist activities, and is known as a stronghold for the Gaza-based terror group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).

Indeed, the perpetrators of multiple terror attacks in the last two months in Israel have been residents of Jenin or surrounding villages, including the Palestinian terrorist who murdered three people in a Tel Aviv bar on April 7, and the ISIS-inspired gunman who slaughtered five in Bnei Brak.

Second, the absence of any reference in the article to the terror wave that prompted the raid in Jenin is a troubling omission: it makes it possible for the IDF’s incursion into Jenin to be interpreted as entirely unwarranted, and suggests that the raid was launched only in order to victimize the camp’s residents.

The unfortunate fact is that such military expeditions into Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank are a necessity, in order to capture those who have committed terrorist acts, or to apprehend individuals suspected of planning future attacks.

Finally, the segue into the description of Abu Akleh’s work as dedicated to revealing the “hardship” Palestinians endure “under Israeli rule,” hints at the debunked Israel as a colonialist entity myth.

In fact, Jenin is administered by the Palestinian Authority — as agreed under the Oslo Accords. As noted, the entry of Israeli soldiers into the area is only for security purposes and is generally coordinated with Palestinian forces.

The above points may seem minor, a mere matter of semantics. However, they are of vital importance when we consider how many people around the world rely on The Washington Post and other prominent publications to gain a better understanding of the events surrounding Abu Akleh’s death and wider Israeli-Palestinian issues.

So why did The Washington Post and other outlets choose to bury such crucial information?

https://krdo.com/news/2022/06/08/man-already-in-custody-for-deadly-pueblo-shootings-served-with-homicide-warrant/,Man already in custody for deadly Pueblo shootings served with homicide warrant – KRDO,"PUEBLO COUNTY, Colo. (KRDO) -- According to the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office, a man already in custody was served with a Homicide Warrant for a 2021 case.

According to the sheriff's office, 32-year-old Nicholas Wayne Tumblin was served with a Homicide Warrant regarding the death of Raymond ""Terry"" Ray Jr.

In August 2021, the sheriff's office responded to reports of a body found near 62nd Lane. The corner later identified him as Ray Jr., 24. According to the PCSO, Ray Jr. was reported missing by his family in July 2021.

Tumblin was already in custody on an unrelated murder charge when detectives served him with the warrant Tuesday. He now faces new charges including Homicide and 2nd Degree Kidnapping. The PCSO says this is a ""No Bond"" warrant.

Tumblin is a suspect in two other Pueblo shootings, one of which was fatal. According to an arrest affidavit obtained by 13 Investigates, Tumblin had been released from the Pueblo County Jail just 11 days earlier. He had been arrested on September 13, 2021, for a parole violation.

A Colorado Springs lawyer who spoke with 13 Investigates said that charge typically results in 180 days in jail.

On September 27, 2021, police responded to a shooting in the 200 block of E. 3rd Street. At the scene, they found a man suffering from an apparent gunshot wound. The victim, 36-year-old Eric Trujillo, later died from his injuries.

That same day, police responded to a shooting at Sancho's Bar and Grill. The owner, Adam Niederstadt, was rushed to the hospital and managed to survive.

Following that shooting, Niederstadt shared with 13 Investigates how he died twice and was in a coma for two days before waking up. He also went on to question why Tumblin was released less than two weeks after the parole violation arrest.

""This guy gets out and then 11 days he is back out on the streets and he shoots me and kills another guy,"" Niederstadt said in 2021. ""With parole, they need to tighten up their ship, because it is not what it used to be. Might as well not even have parole.""

Tumblin was eventually arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service in October 2021 after he was found in New Mexico. He's charged with First Degree Murder and attempted Second Degree Murder in that October 2021 case.",Q3
http://today.az/news/regions/222179.html,U.S. Congress sends gun bill to White House,"By Trend

The U.S. Congress sent a gun bill to the White House, Trend reports citing Xinhua.

The House of Representatives voted 234-193 on Friday to pass the legislation, a day after the Senate approved the measure.

The bill would enhance background checks for gun purchasers younger than 21, provide money to administer ""red-flag"" laws, and crack down on straw buyers.

A spate of mass shootings over the past few weeks have rocked the United States and fueled public frustration with longtime political inaction over gun violence.

A month ago, a gunman attacked an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers in a rampage that has triggered nationwide demonstrations against gun violence.

At least 21,000 people have died from gun violence across the United States so far this year, according to the latest data from Gun Violence Archive.

On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a New York state law that places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside home.

The Supreme Court decision is ""harmful and disturbing,"" Jack Resneck Jr., president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement.

""Firearm violence is a public health crisis, and easier access to weapons and fewer restrictions on who can carry them - and where they can be carried - are dangerous steps in the wrong direction. Overturning decades of reasonable firearm regulations will cost more lives,"" he said.",Q3
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/reducing-pressure-iran%E2%80%99s-revolutionary-guards-raises-risks-america-201712,Reducing Pressure on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Raises Risks for America,"The negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal are stalled over one main issue: Tehran is insisting that its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) be removed from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list maintained by the U.S. State Department and that terrorism sanctions against the entity be dropped as part of a nuclear accord.

While it seems that the United States hasn’t given in yet, there is cause for concern. Over the past year, at least three different sets of sources—including official Iranian government reports, leaks to former U.S. government officials allegedly by career staff, and various scoops and media stories—have all claimed that the Biden administration would delist the IRGC as part of what is increasingly appearing like a lesser version of the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This is despite views shared by then-candidate Joe Biden as well as early appointments to his cabinet about the need to check Iran-backed terrorism and enforce terrorism penalties.

Failing to vigorously enforce existing U.S. sanctions (such as those related to oil) on the Islamic Republic has already put Washington in a tight spot in the nuclear negotiations and greenlit Iran’s nuclear escalation and extortion. But removing terrorism sanctions on the engine of the Islamic Republic’s terror-sponsoring apparatus would be pure strategic folly.

Why is this so? To begin with, the IRGC was created four decades ago as a parallel military force to the national army. As analysts have said, the army protects the state, but the IRGC protects the revolution. In the ensuing decades, the IRGC has become a powerful, and perhaps the most powerful, player inside the Islamic Republic. In addition to having a reported 190,000 members, the IRGC has countless veterans and supporters across Iran’s political, social, religious, military, educational, and economic institutions. The closest analogy is to the Soviet KGB at the height of its powers.

The IRGC has engaged in or supported acts of terrorism, kidnapping, or regional destabilization across multiple continents throughout its existence and has been at the forefront of the Islamic Republic’s efforts to “export” its revolution. The IRGC is the chief military unit responsible for Iran’s foreign operations, with branches like the Quds Force (IRGC-QF) that train and equip proxies to target U.S. military personnel, interests, and partners. During the Iraq War (2003-2011) for example, Iran, through the IRGC and its proxies, was assessed as being complicit in over 600 U.S. fatalities and thousands of injuries. This means that a reported one in six U.S. deaths during the Iraq war can be traced to the IRGC-QF, directly or indirectly.

Another IRGC branch, the Aerospace Force (IRGC-AF), is responsible for the biggest ballistic missile strike against American troops: a January 2020 barrage against unprotected U.S. positions in Iraq. The IRGC-AF is in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, which is the region’s largest. Iran continues to develop, test, transfer, and even use ballistic missiles in military operations.

The Trump administration rightly designated the IRGC and all its branches in April 2019 as an FTO, ending a decade-plus long debate in Washington over whether part or all of the IRGC (because it is a government entity) could be sanctioned for supporting terrorism. The Trump administration first sanctioned the entire IRGC under different counterterrorism authorities in October 2017 pursuant to an act of Congress. Prior to that, the IRGC was sanctioned by the Bush and Obama administrations under various executive orders for its support for weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs (2007) as well as human rights violations in Iran (2011) and Syria (2012).

But the FTO designation is qualitatively different. For starters, unlike the counterterrorism executive order, the FTO designation contains a visa ban provision restricting the travel or immigration of current or former IRGC personnel to the United States. There is also greater room for legal action against the IRGC because the FTO listing carries with it a different standard of evidence for the provision of “material support.” Furthermore, the FTO designation provides for a wider or extraterritorial net to target those providing material support to the IRGC, even if it occurs outside the United States. The FTO penalty also permits victims of IRGC terrorism a private right of action in federal courts to hold the Guard Corps accountable. If the Biden administration removes the IRGC from the FTO list, Americans who have been the victims of IRGC terrorism will face impediments to collecting the damages they are due.

The FTO designation is, therefore, America’s most powerful counterterrorism authority and has been singled out by Tehran for that reason. Iran is unlikely to have jeopardized a nuclear deal that stands to free an estimated 130 billion dollars of frozen assets over the revocation of a designation that some chalk up to being mere “symbolism.”

When combining the prospects of a delisted IRGC with a lapsing nuclear deal, the picture gets worse. Unless significantly amended, the nuclear deal will free the IRGC in Europe, creating sanctions coordination issues for the transatlantic community on the back end of any new deal. Per the JCPOA’s implementation plan, the EU is slated to remove a host of entities from its sanctions lists, including the IRGC, the IRGC-QF, and IRGC-AF in October 2023, just over a year from now.

What’s more, the IRGC controls an estimated 30 percent of the Iranian economy. Along with a host of entities tied to the worst actors in Iran, the Guard Corps were among the main economic beneficiaries of the 2015 deal. These actors remain in prime position both in Iran’s politics and economy to benefit yet again from prospective sanctions relief. For example, in 2020, the Treasury Department highlighted that the IRGC-QF was a major beneficiary of illicit oil sales by entities like the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). Both are likely to receive some form of sanctions relief under a new nuclear deal and will once again be well-positioned to underwrite Iran’s terrorism apparatus.

Lastly, removing terrorism sanctions on an entity that retains the capability and intent to carry out terrorism and has American and allied blood on its hands will not bode well for future U.S. counterterrorism or Middle East policy. Several former U.S. officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, require costly round-the-clock security because the IRGC is trying to kill them. The IRGC is even calling on Americans to engage in domestic terrorism. How can the United States remove the IRGC from the FTO list while it is trying actively to assassinate American citizens? And what would that removal say about whether Washington has a serious counterterrorism program?

Should the administration drop terrorism sanctions on the IRGC, Iran’s constellation of militias in Iraq that forms a key part of its “Axis of Resistance” are likely to double down on rocket and drone attacks against U.S. positions rather than lay down their arms. It would be illogical for Iran’s proxies to see their patron garner sanctions relief through escalation and not aim to replicate Tehran’s resistance model. Washington need not look further than Yemen to see how the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have already stepped-up their missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the aftermath of their FTO designation revocation.

Deal or no deal with Iran, retaining and enforcing America’s most significant counterterrorism authority against the long arm of the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism remains in the national security interest of the U.S. Removing the IRGC from the FTO list will endanger American lives.

Asa Hutchinson said in an interview on Sunday that the state’s near-total abortion ban should be “revisited” in the event the United States Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. Arkansas’ abortion law, which would go into effect if Roe is reversed, allows abortions to save the life of the mother but does not include exceptions for rape or incest.

Hutchinson made the remarks in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” In the interview, Bash pressed Hutchinson on the law in regards to abortions in cases of rape or incest, specifically, why a young girl impregnated by family member should be required to carry a pregnancy to term.

""If Roe v. Wade is reversed, then the trigger law in Arkansas would come into effect,"" he said. ""Life of the mother and rape and incest are two exceptions I believe should have been added.""

“While it’s still life in the womb, life of the unborn, the conception was under criminal circumstances, either incest or rape. And so, those are two exceptions I have recognized I believe are very appropriate,” the Governor said in the interview.

Hutchinson went on, saying that “as time goes on, if Roe v. Wade is reversed, these are going to become very real circumstances.” He added that the state’s laws on abortion could be “revisited.”

“I believe that those exceptions [rape and incest] are going to be important,” he said, adding that “the public understands those exceptions, the importance of it. So I think that will be revisited.”

Hutchinson’s comments come weeks after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was published by Politico. The case surrounds a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. In the opinion, the Justices overturned Roe v. Wade, sending pro-abortion politicians, journalists, and activists into a frenzy.

Arkansas is one of several states with a “trigger law” on the books in the event Roe is overturned. Other states include Louisiana and Missouri. Other states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, have anti-abortion laws that pre-date Roe. Townhall covered Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel said she will not enforce the 91-year-old law if Roe is overturned.

“Politicians do not belong in our doctor’s offices, they don’t belong in our bedrooms and should not be making these kinds of decisions on behalf of the American public and behalf of women across America,” Nessel said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” this month.

On the other hand, other states like South Dakota, Idaho, Texas, Arizona, Nebraska and Florida are moving forward legislation protecting the unborn.",Q3

I, your humble news sherpa, will take you on a tour of the most naturally blessed region of the country, which is also the most troubled and filled with the wokest and spiritually brokest bunch of elected people in the land.

But first, our hearts here at the West Coast, Messed Coast™ Report go out to victims’ families and the entire community of Uvalde, Texas, where grandma took the phone away from her grandson and was shot for performing this minimal amount of parenting. Then, the gunned up, eyeliner-wearing Call of Duty addict decided to do what he’d previously announced he’d do on social media: go to a school and kill a bunch of kids.

We’ll leave the psychological forensics for later, but the police response is looking — in a word — horrible.

It’s here that the West Coast, Messed Coast™ Report can offer some insights on proper police response to an active shooter. We go back to 2012, to the Clackamas, Ore., Towne Center Mall, previously best known as the venue for Tonya Harding’s Olympics training lo those many years, broken laces, and kneecaps ago.

A troubled young man with a stolen rifle traveled to the mall, where he wanted to kill Christmas shoppers. He murdered two and seriously wounded another before an armed shopper and former security guard, Nick Meli, hoisted his Glock (which he was not supposed to have in the mall) and drew down on the bad guy. He didn’t fire, due to innocents hiding in stores behind the murderer, but it was enough to stop the homicidal man. The gunman ducked around a corner and killed himself.

The trained good guy with a gun is a great story. But what’s also notable here is the police response; the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Department took seconds to get there because their station was so close by. They met outside, and when they had a mere handful of officers, established a hunting cell to go inside the mail and hunt the bastard down. They didn’t wait for a tactical team; they were the tactical team.

I wrote about the Clackamas police response at the time:

From the moment of the first report of an “active shooter” at Clackamas Town Center, it took Sheriff’s officials less than three minutes to arrive, set up a command center, arrange for back up and begin to set a perimeter to keep the bad guy inside. Fifty seven seconds after that, the first [law enforcement] sniper showed up. Within four minutes the Clackamas County Sheriff’s command had a description of the shooter and the first “hunting cell” of tactical officers inside and beginning the clearing of the mall. The scanner reflects a near flawless execution of mutual aid from nearby municipalities.

Uvalde has a different set of variables, but one thing Texas doesn’t have is a shortage of people with guns. Why didn’t the cops swarming outside go in sooner to shoot that animal and save more kids? Weren’t they trained for active shooting situations? And if so, how long ago was that?

Twenty or so miles away from Clackamas, downtown Portland business owners just found out from the President of the United States that the the 2020 and 2021 Antifa and BLM riots — featuring millions and millions of dollars in damage, lost lives, hospitalized cops, and vanished business — “unified people of every race and generation.” Joe Biden venerated the attempted destruction of the Mark O. Hatfield federal courthouse, the torching of police agencies, the assassination of a Trump supporter on the street, and assaults of Portlanders who happened to be in their paths.

Even woke Portland must see how disgusting these remarks are.

https://truthout.org/articles/anticipating-roes-dismantling-michigan-judge-blocks-1931-anti-abortion-law/,"Anticipating End of “Roe,” Michigan Judge Blocks 1931 Anti-Abortion Law","A judge in Michigan has placed an injunction on a 1931 anti-abortion law in the state, finding it noncompliant with the state constitution’s protections for bodily autonomy.

Michigan Court of Claims Judge Elizabeth Gleicher issued her ruling on Tuesday, blocking the enforcement of the 91-year-old law in the event that the United States Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, a 1973 federal decision that guaranteed the right to abortion throughout the country.

Conservative justices of the Supreme Court have indicated, through a draft ruling leaked earlier this month, that they are prepared to undo the protections recognized in Roe. In the event of that happening, several states — including Michigan — could revert to arcane anti-abortion laws that were on the books prior to the Roe decision.

Michigan’s law would ban the providing of abortions to residents in the state except in cases where it would be necessary to save a person’s life. It would not make any exceptions for abortion in cases of rape or incest.

Within her judgment, Gleicher found that the 1931 law is in violation of the state constitution’s protections for “bodily integrity,” noting that “pregnancy implicates bodily integrity because even for the healthiest women it carries consequential medical risks.” Pregnancy and childbirth also “transform” a person’s “psychological well-being,” she added, giving more strength to the argument that abortion should not be outlawed.

“Forced pregnancy, and the concomitant compulsion to endure medical and psychological risks accompanying it, contravene the right to make autonomous medical decisions” under Michigan law, Gleicher wrote. “If a woman’s right to bodily integrity is to have any real meaning, it must incorporate her right to make decisions about the health events most likely to change the course of her life: pregnancy and childbirth.”

The ruling was praised by Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel, who said she does not plan to appeal the decision. Gleicher’s injunction, blocking enforcement of the law in the event Roe is overturned, is a “victory for the millions of Michigan women fighting for their rights,” Nessel said.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-Michigan) also said she won’t appeal the ruling, and said she hopes the state Supreme Court will affirm the blocking of the law in the future.

“While today’s preliminary injunction offers immediate, critical relief, we need the Michigan Supreme Court to weigh in and establish the right to abortion under our state Constitution,” Whitmer said.

While neither Nessel nor Whitmer plans to appeal the ruling, state law does allow for the Michigan legislature — currently controlled by Republicans in both chambers — to do so.

Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations – either through need or greed – rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump’s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won’t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws.

On Thursday, acting New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin issued a memo alerting police chiefs that law enforcement agencies ""may not take any adverse action against any officers because they do or do not use cannabis off duty,"" which was codified in the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act.

Police officers are barred from possessing or using marijuana while on the clock, or performing any work while under the influence.

""To be clear, there should be zero tolerance for cannabis use, possession or intoxication while performing the duties of a law enforcement officer,"" Platkin said. ""And there should be zero tolerance for unregulated marijuana consumption by officers at any time, on or off duty, while employed in this state.

""The safety of our communities and our officers demands no less.""

Social media reacts:NJ trolls 420 enthusiasts by starting legal weed sales on 4/21

Platkin's memo comes three days after the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission approved 13 medical marijuana dispensaries to begin selling legal weed to any adult over 21 years old, even those without a medical marijuana card.

Legal weed sales can't begin until a location has been inspected and issued a license. That's yet to occur at any of the 13 dispensaries.

Until those sales occur, New Jersey remains in a gray area: Marijuana is legal to possess and consume, but it's illegal to buy or sell. That hasn't stopped many marijuana consumers over the last 14 months.

More NJ marijuana: Pot dealers find their way in the 'gray market'

The marijuana legalization laws allow any employer to maintain a drug-free workplace, and puts into place procedures for suspected drug use while on the job.

Platkin's memo reminds police chiefs they have the same rights.

""Should there be reasonable suspicion of an officer's use of cannabis while engaged in the performance of their duties, or upon finding any observable signs of intoxication related to cannabis use (including following a work-related accident subject to investigation by the agency), that officer may be required to undergo a drug test,"" Platkin said.

But that drug test must accompany a physical examination as well, as tetrahydrocannabinol — or THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana — can stay in the bloodstream for weeks.

A positive drug test could mean the police officer smoked a joint on the way to the station, or ate a cannabis-infused gummy at an off-duty barbecue a month ago.

But unlike other jobs, law enforcement officers are subject to federal regulations as well. And marijuana is still illegal on the federal level, even medically.

In September 2011, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued a memo overtly stating that firearms licenses cannot be issued or sold to any ""unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled dangerous substance,"" even if that person is a card-carrying medical marijuana patient in their home state.

For the past decade, regulators in numerous states have pointed to that ATF memo as the reason police officers couldn't become medical marijuana patients.

Recreational marijuana use, in states that legalized weed, has been seen as falling under the same guidelines.

But the federal firearms statutes do include an exception for firearms ""issued for the use of the United States or any department or agency thereof or any state or department, agency or political subdivision thereof.""

The ATF did not immediately return a request for comment or clarification.

Nine months earlier, the 69-year-old was serving out a sentence of 50 years to life and worried he would not live to see the outside of Great Meadows Correctional Facility in Comstock. But he was now a free man, and on this day, stood before an audience of lawmakers and criminal justice reform advocates. “Last September, I had a friend of mine – came in when he was 16 years old,” Mingo told the crowd. “He spent 45 years in prison, and he died a week before I came home. But you know what he died from? He died from hopelessness, and he died from not having the support that some of us are fortunate to have.”

Then Mingo urged his fellow New Yorkers to pass two bills that would loosen the state’s parole laws, including the Elder Parole bill, aimed at assisting older inmates who have served long stretches. “This is a moral issue,” he insisted. Mingo is a member of an exclusive group: incarcerated New Yorkers who have suddenly found freedom through, in his own words, “the miracle of clemency” – in his case a commutation granted by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Such intervention is rare. Over the course of 10 years, Cuomo exercised that absolute power a total of 41 times, when thousands were eligible for such grace. During his first term, Cuomo received an average of 670 requests for clemency each year, according to the state Department of Corrections, and granted none. His successor, fellow Democrat Kathy Hochul, has so far signaled she will be every bit as stingy in granting relief. Mingo is advocating a different course.

Since his September release, Mingo has used his perch to champion criminal justice reform. In 2020, it was the multi-racial coalition that emerged in the wake of George Floyd’s murder that helped secure his release. Now, Mingo has joined another coalition, the People’s Campaign for Parole Justice, and said he hopes it can help shorten prison sentences for others. But the campaign faces challenges in Albany, in the form of rising crime amid the pandemic and concerns that progressive reforms are fraught with political risks. “One-quarter of voters say that crime will be the single-most important issue in determining which candidate gets their support for governor in November,” said Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg. A double murder When he was 28 years old, Mingo and two others were charged with a double-robbery murder that took place in Queens in 1980. James Parker died after being shot multiple times, while his girlfriend Karen Sheets was strangled with a metal hanger. They were among the then-record 1,800 homicides in New York City that year. The annual total would top 2,200 a decade later.

Inside, there's so little to do, and there's so much time to do it. And out here, there's so much to do and there's so little time to do it.

Mingo maintained his innocence from the beginning, saying he was in Massachusetts at the time of the killings, staying with his sister, a first-year student at Smith College. But it was to no avail. A co-defendant, Susan King, testified against Mingo and a third defendant, Willie Holmes. All three were convicted. No physical evidence tied Mingo to the crimes, and his court-appointed lawyer refused to call alibi witnesses, Mingo’s supporters have long asserted. The punishment: Mingo received a double-life sentence, for a term ending no sooner than 2031. Mingo said he remembers the day when he last walked as a free man and began what would become the start of nearly four decades of incarceration: July 31st, 1981. This was just a few months into the Reagan era, with the new president having campaigned successfully on a slogan of “Let’s Make America Great Again,” coupled with a “tough on crime” approach to policing. During Reagan’s eight years in office, the prison population at state and federal facilities nearly doubled, with communities of color hit especially hard by new mandatory minimum sentences.

“Among men, blacks (28.5%) are about twice as likely as Hispanics (16.0%) and 6 times more likely than whites (4.4%) to be admitted to prison during their life,” said the authors of a 1991 study for the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The hardest part of imprisonment, Mingo recalled, was “the emotional and mental roller coaster that you go through, the hope that the truth will come out, that somehow you'll wake up and realize that this was all a bad dream.” In prison, he did his best to stay in shape and became an inmate peer counselor. He also spent years advising others on their legal cases, and developed friendships with the many visiting college and law students, some of whom would later vouch for his character. Then in 2020, protests erupted nationwide after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The resulting social justice movement took aim at the use of deadly force by police as well as the disproportionate rate at which Black and brown men were incarcerated. Mingo’s case was championed by his niece Ava Nemes. Noting the lack of physical evidence tying Mingo to the murders and the failure to present any alibi witnesses at trial, Nemes wrote in a Change.org petition urging Cuomo to grant clemency, “Only a Black man in New York in the 1980s could have been convicted on such thin allegations and sent away for so long.” More than 100,000 signed on. Nemes also noted that the judge who’d sentenced Mingo was later censured after using the N-word openly in court.

Mingo got additional support from a team headed by CUNY Law professor Steve Zeidman, director of the school’s Criminal Defense Clinic, who said Mingo was the “poster child” for someone deserving of clemency. The pandemic lent additional urgency to Mingo’s request, as aging inmates in overcrowded conditions were especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. During one 2020 interview that WNYC conducted with Mingo over the phone from a prison wing, a corrections officer could be heard saying he had to end the call. A prison counselor had apparently contracted COVID-19, so the entire wing was being cleared. “Have to go,” said Mingo, abruptly hanging up. Weeks later, Mingo discovered his clemency appeal had not been approved. Clemency miracle Mingo’s clemency “miracle” took place the following year, in August 2021. It was a prison official, a lieutenant, who delivered the news. Mingo was sitting in the prison library when the official found him and told him to step out into the hall – an ominous sign, he thought – and to take his mask off. “So now my mind is racing and I'm wondering, what is this about? And then he pulls out the paper and he reads off that I was granted clemency.” Mingo had already received intimation of his clemency from his sister, but hearing it in all its officialness, his body suddenly grew hot. His knees buckled, he said, and he felt faint. The official said he didn’t look well and told him to lean against a wall, so Mingo did, then asked him to read the letter once more. “I asked him if it was for real. He said it was. Then he took me and put water on my face.” Mingo returned to his cell and told no one his news. That whole night, he stayed up, wondering if it was all a “cruel joke of some sorts.”

In the morning, however, someone woke him up and told him to turn on the TV: Mingo was on the news. The grant of clemency was one of the last acts of Cuomo’s service as governor before resigning amid allegations of serial sexual harassment. Within the prison, Mingo said, word of his clemency made him an “instant celebrity.” The commutation trimmed his sentence; it did not wipe away his convictions. “I remember the day I left, one of the guys upstairs hollered down to me and he said, I want you to listen to this song.” It was “Happy,” by Pharrell Williams. As he left the walls of the prison, Mingo noticed that the air smelled different. He hesitated to take that first step, he said, “just to make sure I'm actually free.” A new life Since September, Mingo’s lived in Ossining, in a home that commands a dramatic view of the Hudson. The property is owned by his sister and her husband, who decided to move to Ossining in 1985 to be closer to Mingo while he was incarcerated at Sing Sing prison, but Mingo was relocated to Attica soon thereafter. Sometimes, he said, he goes out on the porch at night and just listens. “It almost sounds as if the trees are talking to each other, the leaves are talking to each other, the birds are talking to each other,” he said. “I wonder what they’re saying.” He’s hoping to get a paying job, but for the time being, is working as a volunteer on a construction team that builds prefabricated homes for formerly incarcerated people coming home. “Greg is a really good guy, really personable,” said one of his fellow volunteers, John Porco. Reform advocates said Mingo's easygoing personality, combined with his personal story and a reputation as a model prisoner, have helped him land speaking opportunities at conferences and in front of lawmakers. “That really moves our work forward,” said Jose Saldana, the executive director of Release Aging People in Prison, “because it helps the public to understand that people behind bars are people, and in many cases they are mentors and leaders who inspire real and positive change in others.” RAPP is part of a coalition backing a parole reform campaign, specifically an “Elder Parole” bill that would make parole easier for anyone over 55 who’s served at least 15 years of time, as well as a “Fair & Timely” bill aimed at those who have demonstrated a record of improvement. The legislation attempts to address the fact that while the state’s overall prison population has come down, the number of aging inmates has risen. There are currently 4,704 people in New York state prisons over the age of 55 who are incarcerated, of whom 47% are serving life sentences, according to RAPP. Half of this aging population is Black. The campaign has backing from unusual quarters: advocates for survivors of crime and violence, including a number of organizations that wrote to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, asking them to support parole reform. “More than 60% of survivors indicated that they favor shorter prison sentences and more spending on prevention and rehabilitation programs, including education, mental health treatment, and drug treatment,” the authors wrote, drawing upon the 2016 National Survey of Victims’ Views.

What we're doing here is something that is really new, bringing together the parole justice movement, as well as the survivor justice movement in ways that it's never really been done before in New York state.

https://www.wcpo.com/roe-v-wade-meaning-abortion-laws-by-state-new-abortion-law,Roe v. Wade reversal will trigger KY abortion ban: Kentucky leaders share thoughts,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (LEX 18) — If the Supreme Court of the United States reverses Roe v. Wade, abortion rights would no longer be constitutionally protected. Instead, they would be up to each individual state. In Kentucky, that means an immediate ban on abortion.

In 2019, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a trigger law that requires the state to immediately stop abortion services if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade.

And it appears the Supreme Court may be ready to do that. On Monday night, Politico published a leaked opinion that overturns Roe v. Wade.

The Supreme Court confirmed the draft is authentic, but ""it does not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member.""

However, anti-abortion lawmakers in Kentucky hope the draft becomes final.

""Roe v. Wade's day are potentially numbered,"" said Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer when asked about the draft during a press conference in Lexington.

He emphasized that he wants to reserve comment until the Court issues a final ruling, but he made it clear anti-abortion lawmakers are ""all hopeful that what we read last night will become true.""

Thayer said they passed the trigger law because the shift in the membership of the Supreme Court gave them hope Roe v. Wade would be overturned.

""We have a populous here in the Commonwealth that is very conservative and very pro-life, and we wanted to be proactive, not reactive,"" said Thayer.

That ""proactive"" step will mean quick action in Kentucky if the Supreme Court's draft becomes final. That's something abortion rights supporters fear.

""The court is prepared to end the constitutional right to abortion — and meanwhile, anti-abortion groups and politicians are gearing up for a nationwide ban,"" tweeted Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, a group that represents Kentucky.

""We're angry and we're fighting back,"" the tweet continued.

The court is prepared to end the constitutional right to abortion — and meanwhile, anti-abortion groups and politicians are gearing up for a nationwide ban. We're angry and we're fighting back. Join us: https://t.co/RmcJlh1OE2 https://t.co/sUbFmm9I7k — Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) May 3, 2022

When asked about the draft opinion, Governor Andy Beshear expressed concern for what it would mean for women and girls in Kentucky.

""Those that are victims of rape or incest - even the youngest of Kentuckians - will have no options,"" said Beshear. ""Being a former prosecutor, who fought for justice for those individuals, [I believe] they should have those options.""

What happens if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade and Kentucky's ban goes into effect? People wanting to get an abortion will need to travel out of state to find access to one. They likely won't find it in five of Kentucky's seven neighboring states. Virginia and Illinois would be Kentucky's only neighbors that will continue to allow mostly unrestricted abortion services.

BOISE, Idaho — A man who police say killed two people and injured three others during a shooting in October 2021 died by a gunshot wound to the head, according to the Ada County Coroner's office in records obtained in a public records request by KTVB.

Jacob Bergquist, 27, died after he began shooting his weapon throughout the Boise Towne Square Mall, police said in October.

The manner of death listed on the report is suicide.

According to a release by Boise Police Department on Oct. 28, an officer that fired back at Bergquist watched him hide behind a dumpster, where he heard a shot fired.

Bergquist was pronounced dead on Oct. 26, 2021 after being transported to the hospital.

The two victims of the shooting were identified as 26-year-old Jo Acker and 49-year-old Roberto Padilla Arguelles.

Background

Boise Police, Boise Towne Square Mall security, and Idaho State Police were all familiar with the gunman before the deadly rampage, according to law enforcement records.

Bergquist was convicted of felony retail theft in Chicago, Illinois and had a misdemeanor drug possession charge in Wisconsin. On his now-deleted YouTube channel, Bergquist posted videos about how he was a felon who owned guns and strongly advocated for the restoration of felons' firearms rights. He also described himself as disliking Hispanics.

On March 7, 2021, police received a call for service from Walmart in Meridian about Bergquist carrying a firearm in the store.

Bergquist, an employee at the Walmart, was openly carrying a gun while shopping at the Fairview Avenue store, Meridian Police spokeswoman Kelsey Johnston said.

""A manager at Walmart requested that Bergquist remove his firearm per store policy and Jacob became verbally abusive to the manager and then left the store,"" Johnston said in a statement.

Staff at the Walmart called Meridian Police to report the incident, and an responding officer found Bergquist in a nearby parking lot. Bergquist was not arrested or charged, but was given a warning and told not to return to the Walmart, police said last year.

Boise Police also recorded multiple interactions between law enforcement and Bergquist while he was openly carrying a gun in Boise last spring.

At least two officers referred police reports to the Ada County Prosecutor's office to determine whether Bergquist, a felon, was allowed to possess a firearm. ISP also asked the prosecutor's office to look into Bergquist after a trooper came into contact with him at the Statehouse in April.

According to a police report, Bergquist walked into the Capitol with a gun, and told people he was a convicted felon but was allowed to own guns in Idaho. He requested to interview Idaho Gov. Brad Little to get his thoughts on felons owning guns.

The Ada County Prosecutor's Office said the office could not take any action against Bergquist for carrying a firearm because the Illinois theft was not on the list of felony convictions that prohibit firearm possession under Idaho law, as outlined in Idaho Code Section 18-310.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-america-must-restore-assault-041508789.html,My Take: Why America must restore its assault-weapons ban,"After America’s latest mass shooting, it’s amazing how fast the media found scapegoats to blame rather than assign responsibility to the gun in the troubled young man’s hands. Common sense leads to the conclusion that if there was no gun in the man’s hands, it’s likely that the attacker would have been apprehended before killing so many.

This latest mass shooting, on May 24 by an 18-year-old man, killed 19 children and two teachers and injured 17 more in a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school. Before this massacre, using one of the two AR-15 semi-automatic rifles he legally purchased on his 18th birthday, the gunman had aimed a non-fatal but bloody shot at his grandmother’s face.

In the school, officials found 315 rounds of ammunition, 142 of which were spent cartridges. Like the guns, the ammunition was purchased legally.

Nine days before this, another mass shooting occurred — this one in Buffalo, New York, when another 18-year-old man killed 10 people in a supermarket — 11 Black and two white people were shot — by bullets fired from an AR-15-style rifle.

Other recent mass shootings in which AR-15-style assault rifles were used include the following:

Feb. 14, 2018: Shooter at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida killed 17 people.

Oct. 1, 2017: Shooter at Las Vegas event killed 58 people.

Nov. 5, 2017: Shooter at Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooting killed 26 people.

June 12, 2016: The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, left 49 dead.

Dec. 2, 2015: The San Bernardino, California, shooting killed 14 people.

Dec. 14, 2012: The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut took 27 lives.

AR-15-style weapons are offshoots of the M-16 rifles used during the Viet Nam war. Like the M-16, the AR-15 is designed to kill people quickly and in large numbers. The National Rifle Association estimates there are some eight million AR-15s and its variations in circulation, and says they are so popular that the ""AR"" should stand for ""America's Rifle.""

The New York Times reported the Uvalde and Buffalo instances of gun violence are not unusual. “There have been 213 mass shootings in the United States in the first 21 weeks of 2022. An average of 321 Americans are shot every single day. And every day, there are roughly more than 50,000 gun sales recorded.”

Mass shootings were reduced for a decade after President Bill Clinton signed an assault-weapons ban in 1994. After the ban was not renewed in 2004, the number of mass shootings increased. The ban did not, however, prevent the Columbine High School massacre in which two students killed twelve students and one teacher in April 1999.

We are left wondering what can be done to reduce the number of mass shootings. Other countries do not have the gun violence that pervades our American culture. Students, shoppers, and church-goers in other countries do not live in fear being gunned down.

We need to demand our legislators pass a permanent assault weapons ban that will buy back AR-15-style weapons and bump stocks (which can be added to semi-automatics to make them behave more like automatic firearms) from civilians and that will halt their production, importation, and sales for all but military and law enforcement uses. In response to a mass shooting that killed 35 and wounded 28 people in 1996, Australia greatly reduced the number of murders when it instituted a guns buy-back program that removed more than 650,000 from use.

Polls show a majority of Americans have supported stricter gun laws for decades. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted this week showed overwhelming support among Americans for background checks, a ban on assault-style weapons, and other gun restrictions.

We also need a Supreme Court decision that restores the meaning of the first half of the Second Amendment: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The meaning of the first 13 words was lost after the 2008 Supreme Court’s decision in the District of Columbia v. Heller case. By a 5-4 vote the Supreme Court, ignoring the original intent of the amendment, interpreted the Second Amendment to grant individuals the right to possess and use firearms independent of servicing in a well governed militia.

If our legislators fail to produce the changes that are needed, vote for those who will be more responsive to all Americans, not just to those in their political party or to lobbyists.

The MV-22B Osprey crashed in Imperial County near Highway 78 and the town of Glamis, which is 30 miles north of the Mexican border, and 150 miles east of San Diego.

Capt. Nicholas P. Losapio, 31, of Rockingham, New Hampshire, a pilot; Cpl. Seth D. Rasmuson, 21, of Johnson, Wyoming, a crew chief; Capt. John J. Sax, 33, of Placer, a pilot; and Lance Cpl. Evan A. Strickland, 19, of Valencia, New Mexico, a crew chief,, were confirmed as dead by U.S. Marine Corps on Friday.

Nathan Carlson, a crew chief, was previously confirmed to be among the dead by family on Thursday.

The 21-year-old's girlfriend Emily Baxter posted a tribute to the Marine on Facebook, writing: 'My heart is absolutely shattered...I don't have words to explain what I feel or how badly this is tearing me apart already...he had the biggest heart and was always willing to help somebody if they needed.'

Cpl. Nathan E. Carlson, 21, of Winnebago, Illinois was one of the first identified as a victim of the crash

Capt. John J. Sax, 33, of Placer, California, a pilot, had been with the corps for nearly six years and was also decorated with several medals, including the National Defense Service Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; and a Letter of Appreciation.

'It is with heavy hearts that we mourn the loss of five Marines from the Purple Fox family,' the squadron's commanding officer, Lt. Col. John C. Miller, said.

'It is hard to express the impact that this loss has had on our squadron and its families,' Miller added. 'Our primary mission now is taking care of the family members of our fallen Marines and we respectfully request privacy for their families as they navigate this difficult time.'

Rasmuson's home state of Wyoming had already paid tribute to him by flying their flags at half mast Friday.

His father told The Mercury News that Rasmuson grew up hunting, fishing and camping and loving the outdoors.

Capt. Nicholas P. Losapio, 31, of Rockingham, New Hampshire, a pilot, was the longest tenured Marine among the five that died, having served nearly nine years

Lance Cpl. Evan A. Strickland, 19, of Valencia, New Mexico, a crew chief, was the youngest member who lost their life

Cpl. Seth D. Rasmuson, 21, of Johnson, Wyoming, a crew chief, was already being mourned back home in Wyoming Friday with the lowering of flags to half mast

Losapio was the longest tenured Marine among the five that died, having served nearly nine years.

He had been awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal; a Navy Unit Commendation; the National Defense Service Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; and a Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.

Sax had been with the corps for nearly six years and was also decorated with several medals, including the National Defense Service Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; and a Letter of Appreciation.

Strickland served for just over a year and a half but despite that and his young age, still came away with the National Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.

California Governor Gavin Newsom also called for flags to be lowered at the State Capitol on Friday to honor the fallen Marines.

The Marines were based at Camp Pendleton and assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 364 of Marine Aircraft Group 39, part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing headquartered at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.

The Marines were participating in routine live-fire training over their gunnery range in the Imperial Valley desert, said Marine Maj. Mason Englehart, spokesperson for the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.

The Osprey, a hybrid airplane and helicopter, flew in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but has been criticized by some as unsafe. It is designed to take off like a helicopter, rotate its propellers to a horizontal position and cruise like an airplane.

Versions of the aircraft are flown by the Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force.

Prior to Wednesday´s crash, Osprey crashes had caused 46 deaths, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Most recently, four Marines were killed when a Marine Corps Osprey crashed on March 18 near a Norwegian town in the Arctic Circle while participating in a NATO exercise.

The military also announced equipment recovery has begun at the site and the investigation is ongoing.

The crash was confirmed by Naval Air Facility in El Centro on Wednesday, who investigated the crash.

The crash happened about 12.25pm local time, said 1st Lt. Duane Kampa, a 3rd MAW spokesman.

Footage from News 11 Yuma showed military personnel and first responders gathering in the desert, with a helicopter flying off to the crash site. Smoke could be faintly seen on the horizon.

There were rumors the plane had been carrying nuclear material when it crashed, but that has since been debunked.

'Contrary to initial reports, there was no nuclear material on board the aircraft.'

The MV-22B Osprey is a tiltrotor aircraft, built by Boeing, which can carry 24 Marine combat troops, according to Military.com.

Boeing says it is 'a joint service multirole combat aircraft' which has both the vertical performance of a helicopter and the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft.

'With its rotors in vertical position, it can take off, land and hover like a helicopter,' Boeing explain.

'Once airborne, it can convert to a turboprop airplane capable of high-speed, high-altitude flight.

First responders and military personnel are seen arriving at the site of Wednesday's crash

'This combination results in global reach capabilities that allow the V-22 to fill an operational niche unlike any other aircraft.'

It have been in use since 2007.

The aircraft were first tested in 1989, but the program initially struggled, and there were several crashes during testing that resulted in 30 deaths.

Adjustments were made by the Navy and Marine Corps, and it was first deployed in Iraq.

https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/may/17/dual-citizenship-an-inevitable-election-issue/,Dual citizenship an inevitable election issue,"GUEST COLUMN:

Does being a dual citizen mean having divided loyalties?

Republican voters in Pennsylvania will have to decide that at the ballot box in today’s GOP primaries. Celebrity physician Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Senate candidate, is an American-Turkish dual citizen — a fact that hasn’t gone unnoticed by his opponents.

Political attacks on Dr. Oz, based on his dual-citizenship status, belie the United States’ history as a nation of immigrants. Moreover, the United States is becoming a nation of dual citizens due to a global loosening of restrictions combined with a number of European countries heavily liberalizing citizenship by descent laws in recent years.

As more Americans become dual citizens, it’s inevitable that candidates for political office will reflect this growing demographic. To attack a candidate on these grounds is increasingly becoming an anachronism from a less globalized period. It’s also one that calls on our basest xenophobic instinct.

As a general matter, the United States has been permissive of dual citizenship since the early 1990s. Simultaneously, in the past 30 years, the world has experienced a trend toward acceptance (whether explicit or tacit) of dual citizenship. This inclination towards approval includes countries that send many immigrants to the U.S., such as Mexico, El Salvador, South Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and others.

This has two important implications. First, naturalizing U.S. citizens from most countries now automatically become dual citizens. Second, because they remain citizens of their home countries, the future children of these immigrants in most cases also become dual citizens upon their birth here. The Constitution contains no prohibition on these people from being elected to the Senate or House of Representatives so long as they fulfill the age and state residency requirements in Article I, Sections 2 and 3.

The earlier group of these people born in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s are dual citizens and are entering their 30s now. Those who oppose these future candidates based on their citizenship status will have to make the argument that someone born and raised in the United States is not necessarily “American” enough.

Questioning a candidate’s fitness for office based on his or her nationality is not sensible and it’s not American. On a feasibility level, it’s not even practical because Americans are seeking dual citizenship in adulthood.

There are ever-increasing paths to second citizenship for Americans because European countries that saw millions immigrate to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century have passed laws to welcome back the descendants of their citizens.

Since 2011, Hungary, Croatia, Czechia, Bulgaria and, most recently, Slovakia have passed laws making millions of Americans eligible for citizenship by descent. Italy and Ireland, two countries with enormous diasporas in the United States, both have older citizenship-by-descent programs generously allowing children and even great-grandchildren to qualify. Collectively, tens of millions of Americans qualify for dual citizenship under these programs.

Americans are taking these opportunities, and it’s a trend I expect to accelerate as more people in the U.S. become aware of their eligibility for a second nationality. These are Americans adapting to a mobile world with people who move around and integrate in additional communities. To exclude or discredit them as political candidates would obviously reduce our qualified candidate pool for higher office.

If Dr. Oz and other dual-citizen candidates are going to be attacked, it should be over policy beliefs, not dual nationality. In the coming years, criticizing a candidate for being a dual citizen will become archaic — an outdated concern ill-fitted for the reality of a United States with millions of dual citizens.

Philadelphia police say officers who were in the area of the Arrott Transportation Center when they heard gunshots around 7 p.m.

The officers responded to Griscom and Arrott streets where they found two women, ages 57 and 42, with gunshot wounds to the hip area. Sources tell FOX 29 a third gunshot victim later arrived at the hospital.

Police then spotted the armed suspect, later identified as 18-year-old Zyhiem Hartman, and chased him to a property on the 4700 block of Leiper Street. Once inside the residence, police say he barricaded himself in and began firing at police from different floors of the building.

Mario Terrigno said he heard Hartman bust through the front door of his apartment building just before the shooting happened. Terrigno lives in the apartment below where the gunman perched to fire at police, he hid in his bathtub when the shot rang out.

""There was bullets flying everywhere, they were shooting,"" Terrigno told FOX 29's Chris O'Connell. ""I figured that’s the best thing to do. I got windows everywhere there bullet holes through the windows""

Mell Perrin, a nearby neighbor, said he was outside with his two daughters to go get ice cream when the shootout began. He also used the bathtub for shelter for his kids.

""Next thing I know it’s gunshots like boom, boom,"" Mell Perrin told FOX 29's Kelly Rule. ""I look out and there’s cops taking position hiding around places and stuff like that, so I just, we had the kids get in the bathroom in the tub.""

Ervis Onuzi, 28, has been identified as the SEPTA Transit Police officer who was wounded during a gun battle with a suspect on Wednesday. (SEPTA)

During the gunfight, SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel told reporters that a Philadelphia police officer became pinned down by gunfire coming from the residence. Nestel said a SEPTA officer, later identified as 28-year-old Ervis Onuzi, drew his assault weapon and charged Hartman to provide covering fire to free the trapped officer.

""I actually saw the cop wounded and rushed in, like rushed into the cop car, and they took him out of here I hope he’s alright,"" Jonathan Briggs said.

That’s when authorities say Officer Onuzi was shot once in the abdomen. Onuzi, a three-year-veteran of the force, was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. The officer and both women who were injured are expected to be okay.

A neighbor said the firefight between officer and the suspect lasted about 15-20 minutes.

A massive law enforcement presence converged on the house, including Philadelphia police and SWAT officers. Philadelphia police say they used technology to determine that Hartman was down near a second floor window. SWAT team members entered the property and found Hartman dead of a gunshot wound to the head. Further investigation determined Hartman was shot by law-enforcement officers during the gunfire between officers and Hartman.

""It’s just crazy you never know what can happen out here nowadays,"" Briggs said. ""One minute everything’s good the next minute it’s chaos out here.""

Mom Who Allegedly Threw Missing Child in Garbage, Killed by Baby's Father","A woman who allegedly confessed to putting her baby's body in the trash after claiming the two-month-old boy died while he was sleeping was murdered. According to a news release by the Metropolitan Police Department, LaDonia Boggs, was allegedly stabbed to death on Wednesday, April 27, inside a Washington, D.C., apartment on the 1500 block of Benning Road.

Fifth District detectives responded to alerts of an incident in the area just before 3 a.m. They found Boggs ""suffering from an apparent stab wound inside the apartment."" The 39-year-old was declared dead at the scene and taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.

According to the news release, officers from the Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force found and arrested Carl Jones later on Wednesday, charging the 44-year-old with second-degree murder while armed. Cops added that ""this offense was domestic in nature.""

Carl Jones charged with second-degree murder

The Metropolitan Police Department confirmed to People magazine that Jones is the father of Boggs' missing child. It is not clear who Jones has retained as a lawyer to comment on his behalf.

The death of Boggs comes almost a year after she was originally charged with felony murder in the presumed death of her two-month-old child, Kyon Jones. Boggs allegedly was recorded saying the young boy died in his sleep before she threw his body in the trash.

According to a statement from D.C. Police, Jones was last seen alive on May 5 of last year, but the kid was not reported missing until two days later. The Charles City County Sheriff's Office announced last May that authorities were searching a Virginia landfill for the newborn. Baby Kyon's remains have not yet been found.

Boggs revealed how she threw the baby's body in the video

A video of Boggs talking about how her baby had died while sleeping in the bed with her was then shared by a local missing-persons advocate. Boggs revealed in the video, which was obtained by WRC-TV, that the last thing she remembered was that she had rolled over, and the baby was on her chest. Boggs said, ""After that when I was 'sleep, rolled over, noticed he was unresponsive - breathing - and I panicked.""

Boggs then went on to detail how she disposed of the baby's lifeless body in the video, saying she wrapped Kyon in a blanket before throwing it in the trash. Boggs was later arrested without bond.

Court documents also stated Boggs told police that she had taken PCP before accidentally rolling over on the baby. Surveillance video showed the mother taking a car seat, a cardboard box, and a plastic bag to a dumpster at her apartment complex.

Prosecutors decided not to pursue murder charges against Boggs, charging her instead with tampering with evidence. Boggs was awaiting trial when she was murdered.",Q3

A West New York man has been sentenced to 71 years in New Jersey State Prison for a 2019 shooting that killed one man and injured three others, Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez has announced.

Hudson County Superior Court Judge Patrick Arre has sentenced Jonathan Haughey-Morales, a 30-year-old of West New York, for the 2019 mass shooting in North Bergen that killed Carlos Garcia and seriously injured three others.

According to the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office, Haughey-Morales was sentenced to 50 years in New Jersey State Prison for Murder and three consecutive seven year sentences for Aggravated Assault as to the surviving victims, which is subject to the No Early Release Act. An additional five year sentence will run concurrent for Unlawful Possession of a Weapon.

Sentenced for shooting three years ago

On Sunday, May 5, 2019, at approximately 3:30 a.m., the North Bergen Police Department responded to a report of shots fired at 2033 46th Street in North Bergen.

Responding officers found four individuals, including an unresponsive male with an apparent gunshot wound to his torso, shot in the home. The male was later identified as 40-year-old Carlos Garcia.

Garcia and the additional victims two males and one female were all transported by Emergency Medical Services to Jersey City Medical Center. Garcia was pronounced dead at approximately 4:25 a.m.

Haughey-Morales was identified as the suspect wanted in connection with the shooting and apprehended in South Whitehall Township, Pa., the following day. Haughey-Morales was convicted on all charges by a jury on Wednesday, March 2, following a two week trial.

The State was represented in this case by Hudson County Assistant Prosecutor Najma Rana.

http://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/top-stories/us-abortion-clinics-begin-to-close-after-sc-overturns-roe-v--wade.html,US abortion clinics begin to close after SC overturns Roe v. Wade,"Abortion clinics across the US have begun to shut after the Supreme Court overturned its 50-year-old Roe v. Wade decision which granted women constitutional right to abortion.

In the wake of the 5-4 order on Friday, about half of states are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans, out of which 13 have outlawed abortion effective immediately, reports the BBC.

Trigger laws, which allow an instant ban, have already been applied in Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Dakota, Missouri, Oklahoma and Alabama.

Meanwhile, bans in Mississippi and North Dakota will come into effect after their Attorney Generals approve it.

While Wyoming's ban will take effect in five days, Utah's ban must be certified by a legislative council

Bans in Idaho, Tennessee and Texas will be applied in 30 days.

At an abortion clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas, the doors to the patient area shut as soon as the court's opinion was posted online on Friday afternoon.

Staff made calls to tell women that their appointments were cancelled.

""No matter how hard we prepare for bad news, when it finally hits, it hits hard. Having to call these patients and tell them Roe v. Wade was overturned is heartbreaking,"" a nurse at the clinic told the BBC.

In New Orleans, Louisiana, the Women's Health Care Centre, one of only three abortion providers in the state, was also closed.

Due to the Supreme Court ruling, about 36 million women of reproductive age will lose access to abortion, the BBC quoted research from Planned Parenthood, a healthcare organisation that provides abortions, as saying.

Meanwhile, the decision was met with elation by anti-abortion campaigners outside the court in Washington, but protests against the ruling were due to be held in more than 50 cities across the US.

The ruling has led to widespread criticism.

President Joe Biden said the Supreme Court's move will put women's health and lives at risk.

""It's a realisation of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court,"" he said.

Slamming the verdict, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, said the ""Republican-controlled Supreme Court has achieved the GOP's dark and extreme goal of ripping away women's right to make their own reproductive health decisions"".

""American women today have less freedom than their mothers... This cruel ruling is outrageous and heart-wrenching. But make no mistake: the rights of women and all Americans are on the ballot this November.""

The Governors of California, Washington and Oregon have vowed to protect patients travelling from other states for an abortion.

The landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case saw the Supreme Court rule by a vote of seven to two that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.

The ruling gave American women an absolute right to an abortion in the first three months (trimester) of pregnancy, but allowed for restrictions in the second trimester and for prohibitions in the third.",Q3

Highlights At least two Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists were killed on Sunday.

The terrorists were involved in the April 4 attack on CRPF personnel in the city.

According to police records, both the killed terrorists were ‘A’ categorised and linked with LeT.

At least two Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists were killed on Sunday in Srinagar while three security personnel got injured in an encounter.

The terrorists were involved in the April 4 attack on CRPF personnel in the city.

Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said the police was tracking both the Pakistani terrorists from the day of the attack on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men on April 4, and the operation was launched on Sunday after pinpointing their location. This surely is a big success for Srinagar Police, the IGP Kashmir said.

According to police records, both the killed terrorists were ‘A’ categorised and linked with proscribed terror outfit LeT. While Mohammad Bhai was active since 2019, Abu Arsalan was active since year 2021 in Central Kashmir.

“Both the killed terrorists had a history of terror crime cases, including pistol-borne attacks and grenade throwing incidents.

They were also involved in an attack on CRPF personnel on April 4 in Maisuma area in which one CRPF jawan attained martyrdom and another got injured,” he said.

A police spokesman said at about 10:50 am, on specific input generated by Srinagar Police regarding the presence of terrorists in the Bishembar Nagar area of the city, a cordon and search operation was launched by the police and Valley QAT CRPF there.

He said as the search party proceeded towards the suspect spot, the hiding terrorists fired indiscriminately upon search parties which were retaliated, leading to an encounter. In the initial exchange of fire, one terrorist was killed.

‘Cold-Blooded’ Fugitive Who Killed Wife in 1994 Is Caught After Trying to Become U.S. Citizen

A Colombian fugitive who murdered his wife in the 1990s has been arrested in Massachusetts, where he hid out for decades, after he attempted to become a United States citizen.

The FBI arrested William Hernando Usma Acosta, 61, on Wednesday for the 1994 murder of his wife and the attempted murder of his daughter, the bureau announced in a press release. Acosta, who has been living under the alias Carlos Alberto Rendon, fled Colombia after killing his wife Laura Rose Agudelo, and trying to kill his daughter in Medellin, Colombia.

“The murder was the result of a domestic violence incident in which Usma Acosta shot and killed his wife, and then shot his daughter as she tried to intervene,” the press release states. “He fled Colombia shortly after the incident and is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice.”

For the past few decades, Acosta has been living in Belmont, Massachusetts under the Rendon alias and while he did so successfully for years, law enforcement began catching on in 2020. It was at that point that “special agents with the FBI Boston Division’s Violent Crimes Task Force received information that Usma Acosta may be residing in the greater Boston area.” Acosta had blown his cover after he submitted an application to become an American citizen. With the application, he submitted a fraudulent Colombian birth certificate and his real fingerprints. The FBI matched those fingerprints with the wanted fugitive.

The FBI’s Violent Crimes Task Force then tracked Acosta down to his home in Belmont. They arrested him without incident as he was headed into work in Waltham.

The Seventh Circuit Penal Court of Medellin, of the Government of Colombia had sentenced Acosta to 45 years in prison — though the sentence was later reduced to 28 years and six months based on new sentencing guidelines — for aggravated murder, aggravated attempted murder, and illegal possession of a firearm in 1996. He was also sentenced to 10 years of Restricted Citizen’s Rights.

While on the run, Acosta started a new family. He remarried in 1998 to an American citizen and became a permanent resident in America as a result. He had a son with his new wife.

It’s not clear if he has a lawyer.

“William Hernando Usma Acosta is a convicted cold-blooded killer who thought he could evade justice by entering the United States and creating a new identity for himself so he could live under the radar. He needs to face justice for what he did, and today’s arrest ensures that he will,” Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston Division, stated on Wednesday. “The Commonwealth of Massachusetts will not be a safe haven for those wanted in their native countries, and the FBI will continue to leverage our international partnerships to remove dangerous fugitives like him from our communities.”",Q3

“I’m really glad this part is over with and I’m looking forward to a robust general election campaign,"" Mulroy said Tuesday night. ""We can’t keep doing things the way we’ve been doing them. It’s time for a change. (The voters) need to keep an open mind about new approaches that have been proven to work in other cities to make the system fairer and also bend the curb on violent crime.”

Mulroy will face incumbent Amy Weirich in the August 4 general election. Weirich, a Republican, was unchallenged in her primary. She has held office as Shelby County District attorney since being appointed to the role by then-Gov. Bill Haslam in 2011.

COUNTY COMMISSION PRIMARIES:Two incumbents win in Shelby County Commission primaries marked by tight races

Mulroy received 22,123 votes (46%) to White's 15,876 (33%) and Harris' 10,055 (21%), according to unofficial vote totals from the Shelby County Election Commission. Only about 10.8% of Shelby County's 582,421 registered voters cast a ballot during the primary.

Mulroy has been on the law faculty at the University of Memphis since 2000, teaching constitutional law, criminal law, criminal procedure, civil rights and election law, according to the school's website. He is a former civil rights lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department and a former federal prosecutor. He tried a number of voting rights cases which went to the Supreme Court, multi-million dollar lending discrimination and redlining cases, and bench and jury criminal cases before federal district courts and U.S. Circuit appellate courts, according to his biography at the University of Memphis' website.

From 2006 to 2014, Mulroy was a Shelby County commissioner. He has also served on the board of the Memphis Bar Association.

The race between the three Democrats focused largely on attacking Weirich, with each of the Democrats arguing that they were best positioned to take on the incumbent Republican.

Mulroy, Harris and White often agreed on policy: That they would focus on violent crime, decrease juvenile transfer, create a conviction review unit and seek bail reform.

That left much of the debate centered on which of the candidates had the most — or most pertinent — experience to hold the role of district attorney general, and who was most likely to defeat Weirich in the general election.

Harris has 15 years of experience as a federal prosecutor and also previously worked as a federal judicial law clerk to the late U.S. District Court Judge Jerome Turner and as a private practice constitutional law and civil rights attorney. She also had worked as a Memphis police officer.

White is an attorney at Bailey, Bailey, & White PLLC. She previously served as a judicial law clerk to then-Chancellor Kenny Armstrong of the Shelby County Chancery Court, clerked for Bernice Bouie Donald, who at the time was a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Tennessee.

Supporters of Mulroy included Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, former County Mayor Joe Ford, City Councilman Jeff Warren, Criminal Court Clerk Heidi Kuhn, former State Rep. Johnnie Turner, former State Rep. Jeanne Richardson, Shelby County Commissioner Van Turner, Shelby County Commissioner Reginald Milton, Shelby County Clerk Wanda Halbert and AFL-CIO Labor Council President Irvin Calliste.

https://www.ktvu.com/news/san-francisco-archbishop-bans-pelosi-from-receiving-communion-over-abortion-support,San Francisco archbishop bans Pelosi from receiving communion over abortion support,"San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone said Friday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barred from receiving Holy Communion over her support for abortion rights.

Cordileone said in a letter to the California Democrat that she won't be admitted to Holy Communion at Mass. The archbishop said Pelosi ignored his warning in April to either repudiate her advocacy for abortion rights or refrain from using her religion to justify her stance.

""As you have not publicly repudiated your position on abortion, and continue to refer to your Catholic faith in justifying your position and to receive Holy Communion, that time has now come,"" Cordileone wrote.

He added, ""Therefore, in light of my responsibility as the Archbishop of San Francisco to be ‘concerned for all the Christian faithful entrusted to [my] care’ ... I am hereby notifying you that you are not to present yourself for Holy Communion and, should you do so, you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion, until such time as you publicly repudiate your advocacy for the legitimacy of abortion and confess and receive absolution of this grave sin in the sacrament of Penance.""

On May 5, Pelosi spoke with reporters on Capitol Hill about a leaked draft opinion by the US Supreme Court, which suggested Roe v. Wade would soon be overturned. ""It's very damaging. It does violence to the constitution and violence to woman across the country,"" said Pelosi.

Friday, anti-abortion group, the American Life League, released a statement calling the San Francisco Archbishop's decision courageous, in defense of ""the faithful"" and ""innocent human life.""

Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator, Scott Wiener, condemned the move. ""The Archbishop is trying to bully the speaker into ignoring her constituents,"" said Wiener. ""San Franciscans overwhelmingly want access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion.""

The Catechism of the Catholic Church is unambiguous on the question of abortion, both in procuring one and assisting in the practice: ""Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion,"" the catechism says . ""This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.""

""Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,"" it says, before calling abortion and infanticide ""abominable crimes.""

It also declares that ""Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life.""

However, despite that clarity, liberal Catholic politicians have consistently attempted to try and align their Catholic beliefs with their support of abortion rights. Then New York Gov. Mario Cuomo famously declared himself personally opposed to abortion in 1984, but said he could not impose that view on the country.

But since then, Democrats such as Pelosi have been more full throated in their support of pro-abortion policies. The House Leader has sparred with the Church for years on the matter as she has tried to present herself both as a ""devout"" Catholic, while also a supporter of a practice that the Catholic Church condemns as a moral evil.

In the wake of the leaked opinion this month suggesting that the Supreme Court will soon overturn Roe v Wade, Pelosi has not talked about reducing abortion, but she has continued to claim that her pro-choice stance is in line with Catholic teaching.

https://www.abc15.com/rebound/state-of-education/arizona-schools-in-legal-battle-with-state-over-security-upgrades,Arizona schools in legal battle with state over security upgrades,"Before mass shootings in Parkland, Florida and Uvalde, Texas, Arizona school districts sued the state over funding for capital projects that could improve security.

The 18-page lawsuit was filed in 2017 and is currently making its way through courts.

Still, the recent shooting in Texas has highlighted the need for districts to make schools as safe as possible.

""Arizona is sitting on $5 billion right now, they could easily resolve this,"" said Danny Adelman, an attorney with Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest.

Adelman's lawsuit accuses the state of failing to provide enough money to address basic needs including technology, transportation and security.

In 2014, the state published a list with recommendations that districts should follow to make their schools safer.

However, under Arizona law, the state only pays for items that are required, not recommended.

""We found that within in the Arizona Administration Code, the definition of an adequately safe school is basically a perimeter fence,"" said Dale Ponder, Crane Elementary School District's chief financial officer.

""We feel that in today's climate, there should be a great focus just beyond a physical barrier,"" he said.

According to Adelman, only certain districts can afford the upgraded security measures.

""Our constitution says the state has to provide a general and uniform system for education,"" said Adelman.

""How is it uniform if only the rich districts can afford to keep themselves safe and poor districts can't,"" he said.

Ponder said Crane has been phasing in upgrades but could speed up the process if they got more funding.

ABC15 reached out to the governor's office regarding the lawsuit. However, a spokesperson said they do not comment on pending litigation.

The governor has proposed legislation to improve security at schools.

That plan included enhanced background checks, more mental health resources and additional school resource officers but did not include any capital improvements.

The case has several motions under review by a Superior Court Judge in Maricopa County. A trial date has not been set.

“Due to today’s court ruling, effective immediately, TSA will no longer enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs,” the Transportation Safety Administration said in a statement. “TSA will also rescind the new Security Directives that were scheduled to take effect tomorrow. CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings at this time.”

Here’s a look at how various local agencies and services have responded to the maneuver:

MBTA

The MBTA rescinded its mask requirement on all MBTA vehicles and MBTA properties later in the day on Tuesday.

Masks will still be required by users of The RIDE paratransit services.

“Customers are no longer required to wear a mask on MBTA vehicles, or at stations or facilities if they choose not to; however, if people feel more comfortable wearing a facemask, then by all means continue to do so,” MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said in a news release.

“The MBTA remains committed to safety and will continue adhering to all CDC and Massachusetts’ public health guidance.”

The MBTA said in a statement that it is still cleaning its vehicles and stations, and that the T regularly upgrades vehicles’ air filtration systems.

Most of the state’s 15 Regional Transit Authorities (RTA) are also rescinding the face-covering mandate, the MBTA said, but people should check with their RTA to confirm.

Logan Airport

In line with updated guidance from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), travelers using Massport facilities are no longer required to wear face coverings, Massport announced Tuesday in a news release.

This means the mask mandate has been dropped at airports, including Boston Logan Airport, as well as Conley Terminal and the Logan Express service.

“The Commonwealth has followed federal guidance in terms of face coverings and to be consistent with that, we are lifting the face covering mandate at the Commonwealth’s transportation hubs and on most public transportation vehicles,” Transportation Secretary and CEO Jamey Tesler said in the release.

“While these face covering requirements are being lifted, we remind travelers that masks are welcome if people choose to wear them.”

Massport CEO Lisa Wieland added that there may still be mask requirements onboard international flights, so passengers should check the regulations of the airline they’re flying with, as well as regulations at their destination.

Amtrak

Amtrak said masks are not required any longer for passengers or employees.

“While Amtrak passengers and employees are no longer required to wear masks while onboard trains or in stations, masks are welcome and remain an important preventive measure against COVID-19,” the agency said. “Anyone needing or choosing to wear one is encouraged to do so.”

Uber

For Uber, riders are no longer required to wear a mask, and can also ride in the front seat, the company said in a statement. This only applies to U.S. riders.

“While mask usage is still recommended, we’ve updated our Covid Safety policies,” the company said. “Let’s move forward, safely together.”

You can now ride without a mask and use the front seat if you need to. While mask usage is still recommended, we’ve updated our Covid Safety policies. Let’s move forward, safely together.

Masks are now optional for Lyft riders, according to a statement.

“We know that everyone has different comfort levels, and anyone who wants to continue wearing a mask is encouraged to do so,” the company said in a statement. “As always, drivers or riders can decline to accept or cancel any ride they don’t wish to take.”",Q3
https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2022/apr/24/two-people-killed-in-roadway-crashes/,Two people killed in roadway crashes,"Two people were killed and four more injured in wrecks on Arkansas roads Friday evening, according to preliminary reports from the Arkansas State Police.

Leodegario Gonzalez, 25, of Fort Smith, was killed in a wreck on his moped just after 6 p.m. Friday on Grand Avenue in Fort Smith.

Gonzalez was traveling west in the turn lane at high speed and struck a 2002 Dodge Ram that was eastbound on Grand Avenue, also in the turn lane.

Aleshia Guerra, 39, of Lepanto, was killed in a collision between a Polaris Ranger ATV and a Suzuki motorcycle around 6:50 p.m. on Arkansas 140 in rural Poinsett County.

Both vehicles were in the westbound lane, and Xzavier Reed, 23, of Jonesboro, the motorcycle driver, was trying to pass vehicles when the Polaris, driven by Guerra, turned into a private driveway, causing the vehicles to collide in the eastbound lane.

Reed was injured, as were three unidentified minors who were passengers in the ATV.

Troopers investigating both wrecks reported that the weather was clear and the roads were dry at the time of each crash.",Q3

Grand Rapids officer Christopher Schurr shot the unarmed Lyoya in the back of the head following a struggle during a traffic stop. Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker said Schurr has turned himself in and will be arraigned tomorrow.

As Lyoya was on the ground, Shurr demanded that he ""let go"" of the officer's Taser, and then fired the fatal shot.

Schurr told Lyoya, a refugee from Congo, that he stopped him because of an issue with his license plate. When he asked for Lyoya's driver's license, Lyoya started to run.

After Schurr caught him, the two men struggled prior to the fatal shot.

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/a-step-toward-restoring-checks-and-balances,A step toward restoring checks and balances,"The Constitution’s checks and balances are not dead yet. Many federal agencies have taken to imposing fines without a jury trial. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals just ruled that this violates the Seventh Amendment. The court also held that senior federal bureaucrats need to be accountable to the president. The media have reacted with apoplexy, but this ruling restores constitutional checks to an increasingly unaccountable administrative state.

The Seventh Amendment guarantees Americans a right to a jury trial “in suits at common law”— for example, charges of fraud. However, federal agencies often prosecute such cases before “administrative law judges.” Despite their name, ALJs are executive branch officers, not judges under Article III of the Constitution. ALJs do not use juries, and agencies do very well before these in-house judges. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission wins 9 in 10 cases before its ALJs.

The Supreme Court has held that ALJs can decide cases involving “public rights” — matters such as awarding government benefits or licenses. But imposing fines for fraud is another matter altogether. An SEC ALJ fined George Jarkesy almost $1 million for (allegedly) defrauding investors in his hedge fund. Jarkesy sued, arguing the Seventh Amendment required a jury of his peers to decide his guilt — not an executive branch officer. The 5th Circuit agreed , holding that Jarkesy had a right to a jury trial because fraud was a common law claim.

This is welcome news. The Constitution’s framers considered jury trials as fundamentally important as voting rights. Using juries takes the power to convict out of the hands of government officials and puts it in the hands of the community — where it is much less likely to be abused. The Constitution might not have been ratified without the promise to protect jury trials in the Bill of Rights.

Nonetheless, administrative agencies (like the SEC) have widely imposed fines and penalties using ALJs in recent decades. These agencies effectively act as prosecutors, judges, and juries. The 5th Circuit’s ruling says they cannot wield this concentrated power.

The 5th Circuit also held that the SEC’s ALJs are unconstitutionally shielded from presidential control. The Supreme Court has allowed Congress to give some executive officers “for cause” removal protections. But in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, the court ruled Congress cannot create multiple layers of these protections. So, if an officer has removal protections, an officer who reports to him cannot. The court held such multilevel removal protections undermine presidential control of the executive branch (this doctrine does not apply to civil service protections because they generally apply to federal employees, not officers).

SEC ALJs enjoy three levels of removal protections. They can only be removed for cause. For cause, SEC commissioners can propose removing them, and for cause, Merit Systems Protection Board members decide whether to dismiss them. The 5th Circuit held these layered removal protections unconstitutional.

This is another reason cases should go to judges and juries, not agency ALJs. Executive branch officers like ALJs cannot constitutionally be too independent of the president whose power they wield. Sending cases to the Article III judiciary protects judicial independence.

The Left’s reaction to the ruling has been borderline hysterical . Vox was particularly over the top , describing the ruling as the “judicial equivalent of tossing a Molotov cocktail into the federal government.” It isn’t, but Vox’s coverage illustrates why Voxsplainers should not always be taken at face value.

Vox claims the ruling would “blow up much of the government’s ability to operate.” Vox appears unaware that since defendants began raising these constitutional challenges, the SEC has switched almost entirely to pursuing cases before Article III judges. The agency has only nine cases pending before ALJs. Federal securities laws continue to be enforced quite effectively.

Vox also argues that the ruling could “throw the Social Security Administration (SSA) into turmoil … [and] overwhelm the federal court system” because it implies the agency’s “small army of ALJs also are not allowed to hear benefits disputes because they would also be too hard for the president to fire.”

Vox appears unaware that the Supreme Court recently held that unconstitutional removal protections do not stop agencies from operating. Rather, courts strike down the removal protections. At most, some decisions would get reconsidered. A ruling holding SSA ALJ removal protections unconstitutional would simply make it easier to fire bad ALJs.

Moreover, everyone agrees that ALJs can constitutionally judge cases like entitlement to Social Security Disability Benefits. These are classic “public rights” cases that need no jury. Even the libertarian advocacy group suing to limit ALJ authority agrees SSA can use them.

Vox’s histrionics aside, the 5th Circuit’s ruling will protect freedom. The ruling reaffirms constitutional checks on government power. The SEC can now only impose fines when a jury finds it appropriate — not a single unaccountable federal bureaucrat.

I was 11 when they murdered Matthew. The windswept prairie outside Laramie, Wyoming where he was found – bloodied, beaten, bound to a wooden fence – by a cyclist was a far cry from the dilapidated duplex I shared with my family in Dayton, Ohio. Nonetheless, I identified the tousle-haired young man who they said was attacked for being gay. Every time his angelic countenance flashed across the television screen a recognition stirred deep inside me. He was me. I was him.

October 12 will mark the 25th anniversary of Matthew Shepard’s death. In the ensuing quarter-century, the LGBTQ community has made remarkable progress, even as we continue the struggle for equality and liberation. As we look ahead to Pride Month, a time for parties and protest, it is important that we reflect on this milestone and what Matthew means to our movement today.

Standing only 5’2” and red lipped, white skinned, and blue eyed, he epitomized the cornfed innocence of American boyhood even as a young adult of 21. Middle-class and middle-American, he reminded many a white suburban mother and father of their own precious brood, especially those with a boy who was perhaps just a little too slight and sensitive for 1990s masculinity.

It is worth contextualizing Matthew in the era he came to define. Matthew was attacked only five months after Ellen DeGeneres boldly announced “Yep, I’m Gay” on the cover of Time magazine, breaking the glass closet for TV stars. The Birdcage had been in theatres the year before, showing a loving if slightly dysfunctional gay family in a positive and affirming light with one of Hollywood’s most beloved talents, Robin Williams, as its lead.

Matthew’s murder in 1997 brought to the forefront of the national consciousness the violence and everyday hate lesbian and gay Americans face. The FBI’s own data reports nearly 1,400 victims of anti-gay violence just that year. Meanwhile, a working paper on President Bill Clinton’s second term released by the ACLU in 1999 found that while his record was far from perfect, Clinton “advanced lesbian and gay rights further than all of his predecessors combined” while noting that he regularly championed a gay-inclusive federal hate crimes bill. That bill would not become law until 2009, when President Barack Obama would sign into law a hate crimes prevention bill commonly known as the Matthew Shepard Act.

Since then, some writers have sought to undo the narrative and recast the meaning of Matthew.

Originally, one of his killers – Aaron McKinney, who along with Russell Henderson was convicted of Matthew’s murder – claimed he had acted out of homophobia when Matthew put his hand on McKinney’s leg. “Guess what, we’re not gay,” Sgt Rob Debree quoted McKinney as saying to the New York Times just over a month after Matthew’s death. “You’re going to get jacked. It’s Gay Awareness Week.”

Yet in 2004, McKinney and his girlfriend at the time of the murder both told ABC News that they had made that up, and that Matthew’s murder was not a hate crime. A 2013 book by Robert Jimenez posited that Matthew was a drug dealer who knew his killers, a claim that Rob Debree – the chief detective on the case – called “truly laughable.” Debree also stated that the book is full of “factual errors and lies.” Even Wyatt Skaggs, Russell Henderson’s defence attorney, told the Bay Area Reporter (one of the oldest LGBTQ news outlets in the country) that Jimenez is “a reporter who doesn’t know very much.”

Other reviews also called Jimenez’s credibility into question. “Jimenez never qualifies how credible the sources are, or validates their closeness to Shepard, or evaluates the potential motivations for their accounts,” Alyssa Rosenberg pointed out in a scathing review shortly after the book’s publication. That did not stop Guardian journalist Julie Bindel from framing Jiminez’s book as undoing a classist narrative that pitted the “affluent” Shephard against “us simple folks with the piece of straw hanging from our mouths, spitting tobacco and shooting pop cans from the front porch,” as Ray Hageman, who both Bindel and Jimenez claim covered the case for Wyoming radio, told the Guardian.

This effort over the past decade by some to dismiss the significance of Matthew Shephard is not, I suspect, without agenda. His murder was an inflection point in the struggle for LGBTQ acceptance and equality, galvanizing the modern gay rights movement movement around a young and innocent martyr. His story is thus an obvious target for those wishing to discredit or diminish that movement. This is despite McKinney himself never claiming to have known Shepard prior to the murder and all credible evidence suggesting the facts as established in 1998 are indeed the facts.

Regardless of their motives, no one – even those operating in good faith – can be allowed to rewrite history with hearsay and innuendo. Matthew Shepard is too important, both as an individual and as a symbol. His place in American history is sacrosanct, as demonstrated by his 2018 internment in the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, “where he rests in safety alongside Helen Keller and other saints of God,” the Cathedral’s website states.

The lessons we can draw from his life and his death demand honest reflection from every American. The hate that Matthew’s murder spotlighted still exists today. Just last year, five people were killed by a far-right gunman in an anti-LGBTQ attack on a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 2018, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein, targeted for being both Jewish and gay, was killed by a former classmate who is a neo-Nazi.

Data from the FBI shows there were more than 1,300 anti LGBTQ hate incidents in 2021, the most recent year available at the time of this writing. That is almost as high as the 1,400 incidents found in 1997, the year Matthew Shepard was murdered. There is no reason to think this will improve anytime soon, especially given that 2023 has set the record for anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country. This includes at least four in Wyoming.

A silver lining is that the state’s own version of Florida’s nefarious “don’t say gay” law failed to pass, meaning perhaps Matthew Shepard can be taught in history classes in his home state. Will he? I doubt it. As Susan Stubson, a member of the Wyoming Republican Party, recently wrote in the New York Times, “Christian nationalists have hijacked both my Republican Party and my faith community by blurring the lines between church and government and in the process rebranding our state’s identity.” She is right to be concerned. A state nicknamed the “Equality State,” whose motto is simply “Equal Rights,” still does not have a hate crime statute on the books, 25 years after one of its most famous sons was murdered for being gay.

It is as if Wyoming has forgotten Matthew Shepard. Perhaps they have, or at the very least prefer to, his death being an inconvenient reminder of the price of hate. The rest of us cannot forget what happened on the high plains outside Laramie all those years ago, when an innocent young man was so badly beaten that his limp little body was mistaken for a scarecrow. We cannot forget for Matthew’s sake, but also for the sake of all the young people who Matthew reminded us of. Young people like Blaze Bernstein. Young people like me, sitting in that dingy duplex, watching the news and wondering if it could happen to Matthew Shepard, could it happen to me.

No child deserves to feel that fear. No parent deserves to know that pain. No American deserves to lose their life simply for being LGBTQ. In an age of rising homophobia and transphobia, may Matthew Shepard remind us of what hate can do – and what a community and a country rallying together to fight injustice can accomplish in the name of one of our own.

Today, as it was 25 years ago, that name is Matthew Shepard.

https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/normal-planet-comicon-kansas-city-set-for-this-weekend,‘Normal’ Planet Comicon Kansas City set for this weekend,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — For the first time in three years, a “normal” Planet Comicon is set for this weekend in Kansas City, Missouri.

The 2020 show was postponed after the COVID-19 pandemic erupted across the Midwest in March 2020 and had to be postponed a second time from August 2020 to August 2021, when a mask mandate remained in effect for the city.

While there will still be some enhanced health and safety protocols — and plenty of exhibitors and attendees will be masked, because it’s comicon — Planet Comicon Kansas City will inch “a little bit closer back to the normal world” on Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Bartle Hall inside the Kansas City Convention Center, even spokesman Chris Phelan said.

Founded in 1999 in Overland Park, Planet Comicon Kansas City is dubbed “the region’s largest and longest-running comic book and pop culture event.”

The 22nd annual show is expected to welcome more than 60,000 attendees with three dozen celebrity guests.

That list includes former “Mythbusters” star Adam Savage, actors Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Saturday and Sunday only) and Ralph Macchio, actress Rachel Skarsten (CW’s “Batwoman”), ‘N Sync crooner Joey Fatone, prolific voice actor Bryce Papenbrook, “Impractical Jokers” star James Murray and several current or former WWE stars — including Booker T (Saturday and Sunday only), Jerry Lawler and Sgt. Slaughter.

Several “Star Wars” voice actors — including Ashley Eckstein (Ahsoka Tano), Matt Lanter (Anakin Skywalker) and James Arnold Taylor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) — also are scheduled to appear along with dozens more creators and acclaimed cosplayers.

The Kansas Cosmosphere also will have the Liberty Bell 7 on display, marking what is believed to be the first comicon to have a flown, crewed spacecraft on exhibit.

Planet Comicon runs from 1 to 8 p.m. on Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets are available online .

Organizers plan to move Planet Comicon Kansas City back to its traditional March date in 2023, according to Phelan.",Q3
https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/ukrainian-leaders-predict-more-gruesome-discoveries-ahead-after-russian-retreat/2757256/,Missile Kills at Least 52 at Crowded Ukrainian Train Station,"A missile hit a train station in eastern Ukraine where thousands had gathered Friday, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more in an attack on a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a new, looming Russian offensive, Ukrainian authorities said.

The attack, denounced by some as yet another war crime in the 6-week-old conflict, came as workers unearthed bodies from a mass grave in Bucha, a town near Ukraine's capital where dozens of killings have been documented after a Russian pullout.

Photos from the station in Kramatorsk showed the dead covered with tarps, and the remnants of a rocket with the words “For the children” painted on it in Russian. About 4,000 civilians had been in and around the station, heeding calls to leave before fighting intensifies in the Donbas region, the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor-general said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who says he expects a tough global response, and other leaders accused Russia’s military of deliberately attacking the station. Russia, in turn, blamed Ukraine, saying it doesn't use the kind of missile that hit the station — a contention experts dismissed.

Zelenskyy told Ukrainians in his nightly video address Friday that efforts would be taken “to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed to.""

Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional governor of Donetsk, in the Donbas, said 52 people were killed, including five children, and many dozens more were wounded.

“There are many people in a serious condition, without arms or legs,” Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Goncharenko said, adding that the local hospital was struggling to treat everyone.

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace denounced the attack as a war crime, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called it “completely unacceptable.”

“There are almost no words for it,” European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in Ukraine, told reporters. “The cynical behavior (by Russia) has almost no benchmark anymore.”

Ukrainian authorities and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of atrocities in the war that began with a Feb. 24 invasion. More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country, and millions more have been displaced. Some of the grisliest evidence has been found in towns around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, from which Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops pulled back in recent days.

In Bucha, Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said investigators found at least three sites of mass shootings of civilians and were still finding bodies in yards, parks and city squares — 90% of whom were shot.

Russia has falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged.

On Friday, workers pulled corpses from a mass grave near a town church under spitting rain, lining up black body bags in rows in the mud.

About 67 people were buried in the grave, according to a statement from Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova's office, which is investigating.

More than thirty people were killed when Russian rockets struck a Ukrainian railway station Friday.

“Like the massacres in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile attack on Kramatorsk should be one of the charges at the tribunal that must be held,” Zelenskyy said, his voice rising in anger late Friday.

He expounded on that theme in an excerpted interview with CBS' “60 Minutes” that aired Friday, citing communications intercepted by the Ukrainian security service.

“There are (Russian) soldiers talking with their parents (about) what they stole and who they abducted. There are recordings of (Russian) prisoners of war who admitted to killing people,” he said. “There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. There are also investigations being conducted based on the remains of the dead.”

Russian forces, who pulled back after failing to take the capital in the face of stiff resistance, have now set their sights on the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking, industrial region where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years and control some areas.

A senior U.S. defense official said Friday that the Pentagon believes some of the retreating units were so badly damaged they are “for all intents and purposes eradicated.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments.

The official did not say how many units sustained such extensive damage, but said the U.S. believes Russia has lost between 15% and 20% of its combat power overall since the war began. While some combat units are withdrawing to be resupplied in Russia, Moscow has added thousands of troops around Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, he said.

The train station hit is in Ukrainian government-controlled territory in the Donbas, but Russia insisted it wasn't behind the attack. Its Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of carrying it out, in a statement carried by state news agency RIA Novosti. So did the region's Moscow-backed separatists, who work closely with Russian regular troops.

Experts refuted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov's assertion that Russian forces “do not use” that type of missile, saying Russia has used it during the war. One analyst added that only Russia would have reason to target railway infrastructure in the Donbas.

“The Ukrainian military is desperately trying to reinforce units in the area … and the railway stations in that area in Ukrainian-held territory are critical for movement of equipment and people,” said Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.

Bronk pointed to other occasions when Russian authorities have tried to deflect blame by claiming their forces no longer use an older weapon “to kind of muddy the waters and try and create doubt.” He also suggested that Russia specifically chose the missile type because Ukraine also has it.

A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, also said Russia’s forces have used the missile — and that given the strike's location and impact, it was ""likely” Russia's.

Ukrainian officials have almost daily pleaded with Western powers to send more arms, and to further punish Russia with sanctions and exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system.

NATO nations agreed Thursday to increase their supply of weapons, and Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger announced on a trip to Ukraine on Friday that his country has donated its Soviet-era S-300 air defense system to Ukraine. Zelenskyy had appealed for S-300s to help the country “close the skies” to Russian warplanes and missiles.

American and Slovak officials said the U.S. will then deploy a Patriot missile system to Slovakia.

After meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday, during which he urged the EU to impose a full embargo on Russian oil and gas, von der Leyen provided him with a questionnaire that is a first step for applying for EU membership.

In anticipation of intensified attacks by Russian forces, hundreds of Ukrainians fled villages that were either under fire or occupied in the southern regions of Mykolaiv and Kherson.

In Kharkiv, Lidiya Mezhiritska stood in the wreckage of her home after overnight missile strikes turned it to rubble.

“The ‘Russian world,’ as they say,” she said, wryly invoking Putin’s nationalist justification for invading Ukraine. “People, children, old people, women are dying. I don’t have a machine gun. I would definitely go (fight), regardless of age.”

https://www.nancyonnorwalk.com/east-norwalk-trees-felled-by-state/,East Norwalk trees felled by State,"Cut trees piled up along the railroad tracks, Saturday in East Norwalk.

NORWALK, Conn. – As some folks were preparing for Earth Day, others were cutting down trees.

“The complete destruction of the entire tree line along the Norwalk Railroad tracks is horrific!!!!” Katherine Snedaker said Friday in an email to City officials.

Snedaker wanted the City to stop the carnage but Planning and Zoning Director Steven Kleppin told her the work was being done by the Connecticut Department of Transportation.

“The City is equally upset,” Norwalk Chief of Staff Laoise King wrote to Snedaker. “This is a joint Eversource/Metro North project that is happening all along the New Haven Line. Unfortunately, the City has no authority to stop them.”

King said, “According to Eversource, the trees, which were planted long ago, have grown into the wires, which creates a hazard for train travel. Eversource is required by state statute to remove any trees interfering with wires. When we learned of the work we advocated strongly for leaving any trees which could safely remain and obtained a commitment from Eversource that they would replant trees which grow to a lower height to avoid this ever having to happen again.”

Other State projects have recently upset Norwalkers. In February, Democratic Town Committee member Diane Keefe said ConnDOT was “denuding the entire perimeter of the Merritt Parkway.”

DTC member Sheri McCready Brown told her the project had “been going on for a long time” and it stemmed from a family being killed when trees fell on their car.

“There have been many trees that have fallen on the Merritt Parkway, not only on cars, but also across the parkway and blocking all the lanes,” Mayor Harry Rilling said. The road dates to the 30s, the trees are even older and “they started to become weak and started to fall more frequently with all the storms we’ve been having. It’s also my understanding now that many of the trees that have been cut down will be replaced with newer trees.”

According to the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, ConnDOT increased the clear zone along the travel lanes from 18 feet to 30 feet, the national standard.

In another tree cutting incident a year ago, Norwalkers were upset when ConnDOT cut down old-growth oak trees along Riverside Avenue as part of a Norwalk River Valley Trail expansion.

The trees were on “property that is either owned by the State or where the State has a right of way… therefore, the State was the decision maker about what trees were to be removed for the building of the trail,” Tree Warden Chris Torre said at the time.

King told Snedaker on Friday that while the City couldn’t stop the destruction, it’s working toward increasing Norwalk’s greenery.

“We know that a healthy and robust tree canopy is essential to healthy, active and beautiful neighborhoods,” King wrote. “The mayor and council have recently committed close to $1,000,000 over the next two years to expanding and growing the City’s tree canopy, including $150,000 in this year’s capital budget.”",Q3
https://www.kut.org/crime-justice/2022-05-26/how-world-leaders-are-reacting-to-the-uvalde-school-shooting,How world leaders are reacting to the Uvalde school shooting,"Officials around the world are responding to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the deadliest such incident to take place in the U.S. in nearly a decade.

In emotional remarks late Tuesday, President Biden characterized it as a uniquely American tragedy.

""They have mental health problems, they have domestic disputes in other countries,"" he said. ""They have people who are lost. But these kinds of mass shootings never happen with the kind of frequency that they happen in America. Why?""

He then called on lawmakers to stand up to the gun lobby.

That same night, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern condemned the shooting, as both a politician and a mother, in an appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. After two consecutive mosque shootings in 2019, New Zealand collected thousands of weapons through a nationwide buyback, and lawmakers voted to ban almost all semi-automatic weapons.

When asked by Colbert how the country was able to take that step, Ardern described New Zealanders as ""very pragmatic people.""

""When we saw something like that happen, everyone said never again, and so it was incumbent on us as politicians to respond to that,"" she said. ""Now, we have legitimate needs for guns in our country, for things like pest control and to protect our biodiversity — but you don't need a military-style semi-automatic to do that.""

And New Zealand isn't the only country to draw attention to the U.S. stance on gun control. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin expressed condolences for the victims' families, but also called the U.S. government hypocritical for failing to act on gun violence at home while attacking foreign countries over their human rights records.

Condolences also poured in from Ukrainian politicians, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who drew parallels between the loss of young innocent lives in Texas and his own war-torn country.

Tyshon Brownlee, was arrested in Oak Park. He is charged with one count of attempted murder and five counts of armed robbery. He was ordered held without bail at a bond hearing Tuesday afternoon. He is due back in court on May 25 at the Skokie courthouse.

Tyshon Brownlee is charged with attempted murder and five counts of armed robbery, in the robbery and shooting of Dakotah Earley, and four other armed robberies in Lincoln Park and Lakeview Chicago Police

""In these instances involving this defendant, we have five innocent victims, and a community that has been terrorized,"" Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday morning at a press conference at Chicago Police headquarters.

According to the charges, Brownlee shot Earley three times after robbing him of his cell phone on May 6 on the 1300 block of West Webster Avenue.

The shooting was caught on surveillance video, which shows the man who shot Earley getting out of a white sedan that had just rounded the corner of Wayne and Webster avenues and hiding behind the wall of a building -- peeking around the corner as Earley walked down the street.

As Earley approached the corner, the robber came out of hiding and pointed his gun at him. Earley gave the man his bag, then grabbed for the gun, and both fell to the ground as they struggled over the gun.

A second robber with a gun rushed up; and as Earley was struggling with the first robber, one of them can be heard demanding the passcode to his phone. Then the first robber shot Earley and took his cell phone.

WARNING: Video contains graphic content:

As Earley was lying on the ground, the robber again asked him for his passcode before shooting him a second time. After asking the victim for his passcode again, Earley told him some numbers before screaming in pain, and the robber shot him a third time while he was still lying in the street.

Brownlee also is charged with four other armed robberies on May 5 and 6 in Lincoln Park and Lakeview.

Cook County prosecutors said, around 10 p.m. on May 5, about five hours before Earley was shot, Brownlee robbed a woman who was walking on the 1100 block of West Barry Avenue while wearing headphones, stealing her purse, phone, and headphones, and demanding her phone's passcode at gunpoint.

Brownlee then walked across the street and robbed a second woman, who was also walking with her headphones on, and took her phone, and demanded the passcode, prosecutors said. When she gave him the wrong passcode, Brownlee took the headphones off her head, and fled the scene in a stolen white BMW sedan.

Prosecutors said Brownlee hacked into one victim's iCloud account, made changes on her social media page, and stole money from her Venmo account.

About half an hour after those robberies, Brownlee approached a man on the 2900 block of North Racine Avenue, pointed a gun at his chest, and demanded his phone and passcode, telling the victim he would ""come back and pop"" him if his code did not work. Brownlee later used that victim's debit card at a gas station.

CBS 2's Tim McNicholas talked with the victim of that incident, Alex Wang, on Monday afternoon.

""I'm hoping they put these guys away, and I'm hoping it sends a message to the other people out there,"" Wang said.

Then, just moments before Brownlee shot Earley, prosecutors said he robbed a DePaul University student at gunpoint in the 1100 block of West Fullerton Avenue, taking the victim's cell phone and wallet, before fleeing the scene in a white car.

Chicago Police Supt. David Brown said Brownlee was arrested at his home on Sunday, after police identified him as the shooter, thanks to surveillance video footage, and an examination of recent crime patterns in the area of the shooting.

Chicago Police Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said Brownlee admitted to shooting Earley, although Deenihan declined to speculate on why Brownlee shot Earley when he did not fire a gun in any of the other robberies.

""You can almost hear on the video, he takes the victim's phone, then he starts asking for the passcode,"" Deenihan said. ""I can't tell you specifically is that the reason. Obviously the victim in this case fought back. I mean, it was his initial instinct. You guys can see on the video, his initial instincts are to fight back, and then it immediately leads to this shooting.""

Deenihan said Brownlee used a credit card belonging to one of the victims of his robbery spree, which helped detectives track him down.

After identifying Brownlee as a suspect in the shooting of Earley, detectives learned Brownlee himself had been shot on May 10 while riding in a car on Michigan Avenue near Millennium Park.

Detectives went to the hospital to try to question Brownlee, ""but he had left the hospital as quickly as possible, probably understanding what was happening as well,"" so police weren't able to arrest him until a few days later.

Prosecutors said, as police were investigating, Brownlee's picture was placed in a photo array, and an officer recognized him in footage from the gas station where he'd used one of the earlier robbery victim's cards to get gas.

On Monday, after Brownlee had been arrested, Earley was able to identify him in a photo array by circling Brownlee's picture in a photo array and give a thumbs-up, because he is unable to speak due to his jaw being wired shut.

When police asked if Brownlee had punched, stabbed, or shot him, Earley made a gun gesture with his fingers and nodded his head, according to prosecutors.

Wang – the victim of the robbery at Altgeld Street and Racine Avenue - started to wonder if there was a connection to what happened to him after seeing the disturbing video at which Earley was shot.

""I was like, that sounds like very similar to my case - and then the car that was in the video looked similar to the car that the guy pulled up and jumped out of,"" Wang said.

Police told Wang it was indeed the same robber.

Wang says he may never fully let his guard down after the robbery. He moved to Chicago from Missouri in January - and settled in Lincoln Park for a reason.

""This part of Chicago is supposed to be safe,"" Wang said. ""I've definitely been a lot more careful - had to be more mindful of my surroundings when I'm walking around.""

Meanwhile, Supt. Brown said detectives are still working to identify anyone else involved in the robbery spree.

""We will keep working to hold everyone involved accountable,"" Brown said. ""We won't stop investigating until each of these offenders are found.""

Hopkins said more arrests are likely. He said Brownlee likely did not act alone.

Longtime neighbors are hopeful that all who were involved are arrested. They said they are waiting for their safe haven to return.

""We're going to have to start being more careful of where we go, what we do, until something happens,"" neighbor Karen Andrews told CBS 2's Marissa Perlman.

Brownlee was ordered held without bond Tuesday.

At a community safety meeting Monday night, Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) said a 19-year-old suspect who was being questioned in Earley's shooting ""has five carjacking arrests on his record in the last two years,"" although Hopkins did not identify the suspect by name.

Brown said Tuesday the attempted murder and armed robbery charges are Brownlee's first arrests as an adult. Any juvenile arrests or charges would not be open to the public.

Earley was walking on Wayne Avenue near Webster Avenue around 3 a.m. on May 6 when one of two robbers came out of hiding and pointed a gun at him. After giving the offender his bag, Earley reached for the gun, and both fell to the ground as they struggled over the gun. He was shot three times while robbers asked for his cellphone password.

He was taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in critical condition with two gunshot wounds to the back, and one gunshot wound to the head -- resulting in partial loss of his colon. His family has reported he has shown signs of improvement over the past several days.

Hopkins confirmed Earley is out of the coma, breathing on his own and can communicate with hand signals.

""He continues to fight for his life at Illinois Masonic Hospital. The reason I get emotional is I talk to his mother everyday since this incident happened,"" Hopkins said. ""She's quite a woman. We pray together and I tried to do the best I could to encourage her and keep her spirits up, but one thing I can't do is explain why this happened. And I can't tell her the shame my neighborhood feels that this was allowed to occur on our beautiful manicured streets that we are so proud of. Its just heartbreaking. I know we can't live this way.""

Earley's family says he recently had to have his jaw wired shut and part of his leg was amputated. Despite that, he is in good spirits.

At Brownlee's bond hearing, his public defender said the 19-year-old lives with his mother in Chicago, and graduated from North Lawndale College Prep High School in 2020, and now works at a Jewel-Osco store.",Q3

The shooting occurred at in the 10000 block of Tinton Court at Carriage House East Apartments near East 42nd Street and Mitthoeffer Road. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police officers responded to the complex shortly before 2 a.m. and found the man with at least one gunshot wound.

He was identified as Dashawn Roscoe, 41, according to the Marion County Coroner's Office.

Emergency medical personnel pronounced Roscoe dead at the scene.

Detectives learned in their early investigation there was a disturbance between Roscoe and another person when the shooting occurred. Police said the other person involved was interviewed then released pending further investigation and a review by the Marion County Prosecutor's Office.

Police said the case will be presented to prosecutors for a charging decision.

The Carriage House East apartment complex also was the scene of a deadly shooting in January, and a quadruple shooting in 2020.

Marlin Kiser was shot and killed on the property on Jan. 30. Police arrested 29-year-old Andre Johnson in the shooting. Court records said the two men “had a history” together and security cameras captured a pickup at the scene shortly after the shooting that was registered to Johnson.

Nearly two years earlier, three men and a woman died after being shot in an apartment at the complex. Arriving officers found the back patio door shattered from bullets, and Jalen Roberts, 19; Marcel Wills, 20; Braxton Ford, 21; and Kimari Hunt, 21, dead inside.

Prosecutors charged four teenagers with murder in the quadruple homicide.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — On Thursday, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed Alyssa's Law, which requires schools to consider silent panic alarm systems when reviewing school safety plans.

""I am proud of the work we have done to pass a nation-leading bill package to crack down on the scourge of gun violence, but this is an ongoing fight and we cannot stop there,"" Hochul said.

""We will continue to take aggressive action until every child in New York is safe to pursue an education without the fear of senseless tragedy. That's why I am proud to put pen to paper on Alyssa's Law, a real and meaningful piece of legislation that will require school districts to evaluate systems that can save precious minutes - and lives - in the event of an active shooter situation.""

The law is named after Alyssa Alhadeff who was killed in the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in 2019. Her parents have started a foundation in her honor advocating for the use of silent panic alarm systems in schools.

The bill requires schools to consider the alarm system when developing school safety plans and authorizes the inclusion within the building level safety plan.

Signing of this law comes shortly after a shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The silent alarms would aim to help get law enforcement notified as soon as possible.

At the bill signing, Hochul also addressed the public education plan surrounding the state's newly expanded Red Flag Laws.

Teachers, school boards, superintendents, school related professionals, principals, and parent-teacher association will receive training on how and when to complete the necessary paperwork to file an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) as well as address questions.

Hochul also announced a series of roundtables for local and county law enforcement to discuss new policies and procedures required under the law and best practices for implementation of New York's expanded Red Flag Laws. These talks will be led by State Police and the Municipal Police Training Council.

Trainings will also be created for emergency call center professionals.",Q3

https://theintercept.com/2022/06/10/rashida-tlaib-urban-empowerment-action-pac-bakari-sellers/,New PAC Backed by Bakari Sellers Plans to Spend $1 Million to Unseat Rep. Rashida Tlaib,"A new political action committee “dedicated to empowering urban communities to narrow the wealth gap between Black and White Americans” has picked its most prominent and first incumbent target this cycle: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.

Launched in October by more than 40 Black business and civic leaders, the group, Urban Empowerment Action PAC, has labeled the challenge against Tlaib its “premier race” and plans to spend at least $1 million to unseat her, arguing that Detroit, a city that is majority Black, should be represented by a Black member in Congress. The PAC is primarily funded by billionaire hedge fund investor and philanthropist Daniel Loeb, though its initial founder remains unknown.

The slew in planned spending comes as top Democrats continue to fight against the party’s progressive wing with help from Republican donors and outside groups backing conservative candidates in both parties. Democratic leaders and outside groups aligned with them have spent millions so far to defeat progressives in several competitive primaries this cycle.

Tlaib is facing her second primary as an incumbent in August, having fended off a 2020 challenge from fellow Michigan Democrat Brenda Jones, who replaced former Democratic Rep. John Conyers after a special election in 2018. Tlaib’s supporters point to her wins for her Detroit constituents, including $15 million she secured for local community projects in this year’s House budget bill, her efforts to extend the child tax credit, and the pandemic aid funding she obtained for her district in 2020, when Detroit received the fifth-largest appropriation among major cities.

UEA PAC spokesperson Henry Greenidge told The Intercept that the group is targeting Tlaib because its “aim is to get Black candidates in office who will champion common-sense solutions that uplift Black people.” Greenidge said that because of Michigan’s recent redistricting, Tlaib “is running for a newly drawn seat where she is not an incumbent in the largest majority-Black city in America, a seat we believe should be represented by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.” The group is backing candidate Janice Winfrey, Detroit’s city clerk, who has slammed Tlaib’s vote against last year’s bipartisan infrastructure package and her criticism of U.S. military funding to Israel, which Winfrey supports.

Tlaib was first elected in 2018 on a wave that brought several progressives into the House, including Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; the two became the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Loeb, the first and single largest donor to UEA PAC, has supported several conservative Democrats, including Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio. A registered Democrat, he has given more than $1 million to Republicans so far this cycle and gave UEA PAC $150,000 in October.

In addition to Loeb, UEA PAC is backed by political pundit and former South Carolina state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who is also helping it raise funds. The group has spent $115,000 since late May backing Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., who won her primary last month with more than 86 percent of the vote, and Democratic California state Sen. Sydney Kamlager, who led in Tuesday’s nonpartisan primary. In both races, the group has paid for direct-mail and digital ads from Tusk Strategies, the consulting firm started by venture capitalist Bradley Tusk, who supported Mike Bloomberg’s and Andrew Yang’s New York City mayoral campaigns.

The PAC also plans to support candidates Nykea Pippion McGriff in Illinois’s 1st District and Florida state Sen. Randolph Bracy in his state’s 10th District, but so far Tlaib is UEA PAC’s only incumbent target. Sellers told Politico last month that he didn’t have a particular “beef” with Tlaib but criticized her for voting against last year’s infrastructure package. Tlaib and several other progressive Democrats opposed the bill in protest of congressional leadership’s abandonment of their strategy to simultaneously pass President Joe Biden’s massive social spending package — which included the expanded child tax credit that Tlaib sought for Detroit families. Sellers told Politico that “somebody else can do the job better.” Sellers did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.

Tlaib has also long clashed with more conservative members of her party over her vocal criticisms of U.S. military support for Israel and human rights abuses in Palestine. Her public scrutiny of unchecked U.S. funding for Israeli occupation forces has made her a target of pro-Israel groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, of which Sellers is a close ally, and Pro-Israel America, which endorsed Winfrey in March. Tlaib is also facing a challenge from former Michigan state Rep. Shanelle Jackson, who has similarly criticized her stance on Israel.

Loeb has also contributed to AIPAC, giving $5,000 to the group in April alone. AIPAC’s new PAC, United Democracy Project, has also spent millions to defeat progressives this cycle and endorsed more than 100 Republican candidates who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Loeb also gave $125,000 in June to its counterpart, Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, which has also spent similar figures fighting progressives this cycle.

In March, Loeb gave $250,000 to the GOP–aligned Congressional Leadership Fund, another $250,000 to the similarly aligned Senate Leadership Fund, and, since August, more than $340,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He has given more than $255,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee since January and contributed this cycle to the campaigns for Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.; Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker; and Ohio Senate candidate Jane Timken, who ran as a pro-Donald Trump Republican and lost in last month’s primary race.

Other major donors to UEA PAC include the Benoit Group, a real estate developer based in Georgia, and Striving for a Better New York, a PAC linked to New York City Mayor Eric Adams that backs conservative candidates and is funded by real estate moguls and Republicans. In April, UEA PAC received a $10,000 contribution from New Jersey attorney Calvin Souder, a partner at the firm Souder, Shabazz, & Woolridge Law Group, as well as $5,000 each from from Google Vice President of Government Affairs and Public Policy Wilson White, Google Vice President of Trust and Safety David Graff, and Ron Redwing, CEO of the Redwing group, a consulting firm based in Tennessee.

It’s not clear who actually started the PAC, and the only person listed on its filing documents with the Federal Election Commission is Treasurer Diane Evans, the CEO and founder of the compliance consulting firm Evans & Katz Campaign Finance Professionals.

Greenidge, the UEA PAC spokesperson, told The Intercept that the group is “proud to have the support of our numerous donors, including Dan Loeb, who are all committed to fighting for issues that are important to Black communities, such as voter empowerment, access to high-quality education, and creating greater economic opportunity.”

If they manage to unseat Tlaib, conservative Democrats would score a monumental win. The party’s conservative flank has railed against the growing number of progressives who have tried to push the party left, on issues from providing families with direct cash assistance to foreign policy in Israel.",Q3
https://www.southcarolinapublicradio.org/2022-05-04/abortion-wasnt-always-the-politically-charged-issue-it-is-today,Abortion wasn't always the politically charged issue it is today,"ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:

Overturning Roe v. Wade has been arguably the single most animating cause among conservatives in America for decades. Now a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion has made it apparent that goal is close to reality. NPR's Deepa Shivaram reports on how the issue of abortion came to define Republican politics.

DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Abortion wasn't always as politically charged as it is today. Even after the Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade in 1973, there were Democratic and Republican candidates against abortion for a long time, in part to appeal to Catholic voters. Then in 1976, Republicans adopted an anti-abortion stance in their party platform, and the GOP became this political vehicle for the movement as a more vocal Christian right started to rise. Here's Ronald Reagan at the March for Life rally in 1988.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RONALD REAGAN: We're told about a woman's right to control her own body. But doesn't the unborn child have a higher right? And that is to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

SHIVARAM: Leaders like Reagan helped to boost Republicans as a party of, quote, ""family values."" But over the next two decades, more radical, socially conservative figures started putting more pressure on the party.

JENNIFER HOLLAND: Really see the power of the anti-abortion movement to not only be a part of the party, but to really remake a party and demand sort of political uniformity on this issue.

SHIVARAM: That's Jennifer Holland. She's a scholar on the anti-abortion movement and a professor at the University of Oklahoma.

HOLLAND: They had to convince a whole host of people that this was not only political, but the most important political issue that there is, and that everything came second to opposing abortion.

SHIVARAM: She says that movement leaders didn't want elected officials to just believe that abortion was immoral. They wanted them to act on it. Someone who took up that call? Pat Buchanan. Here he is in 1996 during his campaign for president.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PAT BUCHANAN: If I'm nominated, I will choose a pro-life Republican running mate. I will appoint justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade. And I will be the most pro-life president in the history of the United States of America, bar none.

SHIVARAM: In the decades since, Republicans have heavily relied on voters who are staunchly opposed to abortion rights, like white evangelical Christians. It's partly how Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, with his pledge to appoint anti-abortion rights justices to the court.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: The justices that I am going to appoint - and I've named 20 of them - the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent.

SHIVARAM: At the same time, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell put the federal judiciary at the top of his agenda, refusing a hearing on President Obama's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat until the 2016 election was finished, and then in 2020, moving quickly to confirm the third of Trump's Supreme Court picks before the election. Those justices appear set to provide the votes to overturn Roe in the coming weeks.

But even if they get this victory, the anti-abortion movement's ultimate goal is to implement a nationwide ban on abortions. They've gotten one step closer to that with this draft opinion from the Supreme Court, but politically, it could have some consequences. Here's Paul Djupe, a professor of religion and politics at Denison University.

PAUL DJUPE: The tension that Roe v. Wade has created for them was really beneficial. So once that tension is released and states are allowed to do it, they lose the ability to mobilize based on abortion tensions with the federal government.

SHIVARAM: Plus, it could be politically difficult for Republicans to go further on curtailing abortion rights. Nationally, public opinion shows a majority of Americans don't support a full ban on abortion.

1. Warrant issued for bouncer in deadly assault outside Center City bar, officials say

PHILADELPHIA – Authorities have approved a third-degree murder charge against a bouncer accused of a deadly assault outside a Philadelphia bar.

Investigators say they are searching for 24-year-old Kenneth Frye, who was allegedly captured on surveillance camera punching 41-year-old Eric Pope outside Tabu Lounge and Sports in Center City.

Police say surveillance video from Apr.16 shows Pope being escorted out of the bar around 1 a.m. for being overly intoxicated. While standing along South 12th Street, police believe Frye punched him, knocking him to the ground unconscious.

The video shows Pope lying on the ground for a minute before the bouncers moved him to the sidewalk where he stayed for several more minutes as a crowd began to form around him.

Pope died at the hospital one week later, according to police.

Tabu's owner told FOX 29 that the bouncer involved is not an employee of Tabu and that the incident did not occur on their property.

Sources tell FOX 29's Kelly Rule that Frye was employed by Main Line Private Security, an embattled security company that police have received at least five about in the past month.

Activists are calling for justice and accountability for Pope, a Massachusetts native who was visiting Philadelphia from Washington D.C. when the deadly assault happened.

2. Pennsylvania man pleads guilty to striking officer with flagpole during Capitol riot

FILE - Generic gavel on wooden table.

WASHINGTON – Prosecutors say a Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty to using a flagpole to strike a police officer several times during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

According to a Department of Justice press released, 71-year-old Howard C. Richardson entered the restricted area of the U.S. Capitol by pushing past metal barriers and police officers that were attempting to keep the crowd away.

Richardson, a Montgomery County resident, was carrying a flagpole that he used to strike a Metropolitan Police Department officer three times, according to court documents. Richardson allegedly hit the officer with enough force to break the pole, according to investigators.

Authorities arrested Richardson in Philadelphia last November. He pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a felony charge of assaulting law enforcement officers.

Prosecutors say Richardson faces a maximum of eight years in prison and a fine of up to $250k. He is scheduled to be sentenced in late August.

3. Investigation into Kensington fatal fire continues, as mother remains hospitalized

Hartville St fatal fire

PHILADELPHIA – One Philadelphia community is showing an outpouring of support for the family who lost a father and his three sons in a fire, as the probe raises new questions about the owners of the building.

The memorial for the victims of Sunday’s early morning fire has grown to include balloons bobbing in the wind and dozens of candles. A framed picture of the three Arroyo-Santana brothers and their dad, all killed in the flames, has been placed there.

Members of a local ministry known as The Rock have come to check on folks who live in the neighborhood.

A spokesperson the Philadelphia Fire Department says its investigation into the cause is ongoing while investigators hold firm to the belief the home did not have smoke alarm protection.

""We have found no evidence, so far, of working smoke alarms,"" Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said.

Philadelphia’s Department of Licenses and Inspections says the rowhome, owned by Edwin and Gloria Ruiz, did not have a required rental license and the department says it will now send inspectors to a Ruiz-owned property on Widener Street to learn of it’s also an unlicensed rental.

The wife of Alexis and mother of 12-year-old Alexangel Arroyo-Santana, nine-year-old Yadriel and five-year-old Yamalier remains in the hospital, recovering from her leap from the second floor to safety.

With 21 fire deaths in the city just this year, firefighters are urging extreme caution.

4. Police: Group fires more than 20 shots at sound engineer outside South Philadelphia recording studio

Police say a 31-year-old sound engineer was shot once outside of a reccording studio in South Philadelphia.

PHILADELPHIA – Police in Philadelphia are investigating a shooting that took place in South Philadelphia early Wednesday morning, police say.

Officers with the 3rd District responded to a report of gunshots on Jackson Street, according to authorities.

Chief Inspector Scott Small says when officers arrived on the scene they found the shooting scene but were unable to locate a victim. Officers later learned there was a shooting victim around the corner on Columbus Boulevard, Small says.

According to Small, the victim, 31, was suffering from a gunshot wound to the leg and police took him to Jefferson Hospital, where he is in stable condition.

Police say a 31-year-old sound engineer was shot once outside a recording studio in South Philadelphia.

The victim told police he is a sound engineer who was working at a recording studio when he ordered food through Uber Eats, Small says.

Police say, the victim disclosed that when he went outside to meet the Uber Eats delivery driver that he saw five men in masks approaching him.

According to police, the sound engineer said he began to run and was shot in the leg as he fled the scene. He then ran into a Wawa where police later found him, authorities say.

Small says 21 spent shell casings were found outside the recording studio where the victim was shot.

""We know 21 shots were fired from a semi-automatic weapon,"" Small says.

5. Suspect in sex assault on SEPTA’s Broad Street Line in police custody, authorities say

PHILADELPHIA – A suspect sought in several sexual assaults on SEPTA property has been captured, law enforcement sources tell FOX 29's Steve Keeley.

On Tuesday, the Philadelphia Police Department named Quintez Adams, 28, as a suspect in incidents that occurred on Apr. 4 and Apr. 24.

Law enforcement sources say Adams, who is believed to be homeless, is accused of sexually assaulting a woman on a SEPTA Broad Street line train last Sunday. The incident occurred between the Erie and Girard stations early in the afternoon, sources say.

Police say Adams is also wanted in connection with an indecent exposure incident that happened on Apr. 4 near the intersection of 7th and Market streets.

6. Weather Authority: Wind chill a factor Thursday morning as cold temps remain

PHILADELPHIA – Beautiful, blue skies dominate the rest of the week, but lower than average temperatures for the morning will have everyone thinking winter has made a surprise visit to the Delaware Valley.

FOX 29’s Kathy Orr says the wind will remain through Friday. Overnight temperatures into Thursday morning will be cold, with lows dipping to the mid 30s, and with the wind blowing. Wind chill readings will be in the 20s.

The National Weather Service has issued a Freeze Warning for Berks, Lehigh, Northampton and western Chester counties Thursday morning, from 2 a.m. through 8 a.m.

Thursday will be sunny, but highs will only reach the mid to upper 50s, with that brisk wind blowing, so another chilly, below-average day.

Friday will see highs in the low 60s, under sunny skies. The wind won’t be as harsh, but remains a factor.

Saturday should see conditions closer to normal for this time of year, under sunny skies.",Q3

Not yet, but we did pick up on some notable changes here.

Kelly Davis, who runs New Voices for Reproductive Justice, told me that, since the leaked opinion came out, she and her staff have seen a very marked uptick in racial slurs hurled at them, racist language at them in person when they go to the door, as well as online.

She says that they are now putting in place different kinds of security protocols when they are out there trying to do their outreaches. And she says that this is the first time she's really felt a hovering threat to her safety.

At the same time. I also want to show you a photo of something that I saw at that rally in favor of abortion rights on the step of the capitol. That is Judge Alito. What is blurred out there is Justice Alito's home address. This same person also had a sign. On the back of that sign was Justice Kavanaugh's home address, which also, of course, we have blurred out.

So this shows that the fight has become personal at people in leadership roles. And we know that justices on the Supreme Court, there's a sense that they need more security right now around the building itself. And I think that we're in a charged atmosphere. As everyone knows, charged air can be dangerous.

So the words that everyone on all sides uses and their actions going forward really will matter on how this goes.",Q3

The event and series of discussions will highlight the underground press movement from the 1960s and 1970s, with a focus on Pensacola’s short-lived Gulf Coast Fish Cheer.

“They were speaking out against a larger society that just didn’t understand them,” said Scott Satterwhite, curator of the War Against Conformity exhibit on Sixth Avenue in Pensacola. “This had to deal with things from the local newspaper and how they were often derided in it and different parts of the culture. The underground press, here in Pensacola in particular, was a place where a lot of people didn’t feel like they fit into society, but they knew there were a lot more of them out there. They were trying to connect with other people.”

Gulf Coast Fish Cheer, whose name was derived from the Country Joe and the Fish song “The ‘Fish’ Cheer,” was an underground newspaper that formed in 1970 in Pensacola’s Old East Hill neighborhood. Its writers consisted of UWF and Pensacola Junior College students, Vietnam war veterans, and others involved in the counterculture.

Shying away from the mainstream local newspapers of the time, Fish Cheer touched on subjects that were largely unaddressed and radical at the time. Topics highlighted in the paper included black liberation, the antiwar movement, mental health issues, and others.

Scott Satterwhite / 309 Punk Project

“The thing that surprised me the most about the paper when I was looking and going through the issues was the feminist politics of the paper, it’s something that caught me off guard a little bit,” Satterwhite said. “I expected the antiwar stuff and the countercultural things you’d expect in one of these newspapers, but the heavy feminist presence in the paper was tremendous, not only for that time but also in comparison to bigger newspapers from that period where you definitely don’t see it as much.”

By the late 1960s, the underground press movement had exploded, with at least one active paper in most major and minor cities in the United States. This, coupled with the 1970 Kent State massacre, where four college students were killed protesting the Vietnam war, were factors that brought the underground press movement to Pensacola.

“A lot of the 1960s counterculture and underground press, and the hippies involved with these movements, were reacting to not being heard, not being understood, and being misunderstood and misrepresented,” Satterwhite said. “They decided to write the story and they decided to create their own media.”

Fish Cheer covered both local and national stories that were not covered by other mainstream papers at the time. This includes rallies in and around Pensacola.

“They were really in touch with what was happening in the community itself, and were a part of the stories they were writing about,” Satterwhite said. “That’s also a hallmark of the underground press called activist journalism, where you’re doing the actions, and then you’re writing about them afterward.”

Both active-duty military personnel and veterans were also contributors to Fish Cheer. To Satterwhite’s surprise, some naval officers from nearby Naval Air Station Pensacola are cited for writing against the Vietnam War in the paper.

“People wrote from the decks of the USS Lexington about their experiences in the military and people wrote about being in the navy brig,” Satterwhite said. “There was organizing within the U.S. military not just from disaffected, angry veterans who just came back from the war, but also from naval officers, which you don’t see very often.”

“They had a group called the Concerned Officers Movement, and they used the newspaper to broadcast to other military officers that there were more of them out there than they might think,” Satterwhite added.

Within a year of Fish Cheer’s founding, the hippie movement began to dissolve, inevitably taking Fish Cheer with it. Even so, this gave rise to a new countercultural movement: the punk movement.

Scott Satterwhite / 309 Punk Project

Beginning in the early 1970s as a continuation of and reaction to the hippie movement, the punk movement can be regarded as a “younger brother” to the hippie movement. Still around today, and closely intertwined with the 309 Punk Project, the punks have similar ideals to the hippies, including non-conformity and direct action.

“Punks tend to have a little bit more of a realistic sense of the world, and I think we got that from the disillusionment from the hippies,” Satterwhite said. “A lot of the hippies looked at the world with the peace and love aspect, and punks have that too, but it was also with a healthy dose of ‘yeah, but we also know what the world is like, and we’re not looking at this with rose-colored glasses anymore.’”

As the punk movement began to take form, underground journalism continued. Similar to papers like Fish Cheer, the punks adopted an underground medium known as fanzines.

“What surprised me a lot when I was looking at Fish Cheer is how similar these struggles are,” Satterwhite said. “You can almost literally cut out articles from one of these newspapers and put it into a punk fanzine, and you wouldn’t know the difference as far as the content and discussions that are taking place.”

Satterwhite, who has studied Gulf Coast Fish Cheer for over 20 years, hopes that the War Against Conformity event can help people draw the intergenerational connections between the hippie and punk movements. He also points out that both the former Fish Cheer and current 309 Punk Project headquarters are within four blocks of each other.

“Pensacola has always had a really interesting, often radical, version of the counterculture around,” Satterwhite said. “For as long as you can imagine, Pensacola has had that. It’s always been a part of the story, it’s just never written about.”

Scott Satterwhite / 309 Punk Project

The War Against Conformity exhibit will have the only known full-run edition of Gulf Coast Fish Cheer on display. Copies of other underground papers, including Ramparts, Great Speckled Bird, and Black Panther will also be on display.

“Being able to open the newspaper for the first time and see these papers, 50 years old, and read them, they are just as interesting and just as powerful as I’m sure they were for those people when they first saw them,” Satterwhite said.

The War Against Conformity exhibit will be open for viewing from 4 to 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 to 6 p.m. Sunday. A conversation with Gulf Coast Fish Cheer editor Patricia Bint will take place at 7 p.m. Saturday, along with a talk by Aaron Cometbus, “From Fish Cheer to Smell of Dead Fish — the bridge between hippie and punk,” at 6 p.m. Sunday. The exhibit and conversations will take place at the 309 Punk Project, 309 North Sixth Ave., Pensacola.",Q3
https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/08/then-and-now-gop-lawmakers-evolution-on-the-capito/,Then and now: GOP lawmakers' evolution on the Capitol riot,"WASHINGTON — Most every Republican lawmaker expressed outrage in the days after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Some even blamed then-President Donald Trump.

But the larger GOP narrative shifted in the weeks and months that followed. Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy, who had said in the hours after the attack that it had been “the saddest day I have ever had serving as a member of this institution,” went on to visit Trump at his Florida home only weeks after the riot.

Others went further, with some Republican lawmakers defending the rioters or playing down the violence of the mob that beat police officers and smashed its way into the Capitol. The rioters, echoing Trump’s falsehoods about widespread fraud in the election, temporarily stopped the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory.

A few Republicans have consistently criticized Trump, putting their own political future in peril.

A look at comments from key Republicans in the year-and-a half since the attack as the House committee investigating the riot prepares to begin public hearings Thursday night.

HOUSE GOP LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALIF.

On Jan. 13, 2021, just before the Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump over the insurrection, McCarthy said that “ the president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters.""

McCarthy said Trump should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw the violence unfolding.

“These facts require immediate action by President Trump: accept his share of responsibility, quell the brewing unrest, and ensure President-elect Biden is able to successfully begin his term,” McCarthy said. “And the president’s immediate action also deserves congressional action, which is why I think a fact finding commission and a censure resolution would be prudent.”

Just a week later, McCarthy told reporters, ""I don’t believe he provoked it, if you listen to what he said at the rally,” referring to Trump’s speech to his supporters in front of the White House shortly before the assault on the Capitol. Trump had said to march peacefully to the Capitol, but he also told people in the crowd to “fight like hell” or “you’re not going to have a country anymore.”

McCarthy later voted against forming a bipartisan commission to investigate the attack and has called the Democratic-led Jan. 6 committee a partisan sham. He is now appearing with Trump and praising the former president at fundraisers.

Trump never accepted responsibility for the insurrection and has defended the rioters.

___

SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.

McConnell spoke of the “failed insurrection” the night of the attack and said Congress “will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs, or threats.”

He voted weeks later to acquit Trump for inciting the insurrection. But he delivered a scorching rebuke of Trump after that vote, saying that “there is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day. The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.”

McConnell continued: “Their having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories, and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth.”

That same month, McConnell said he would “absolutely” vote for Trump if he were the GOP nominee in 2024.

___

FORMER VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE

Pence was under more pressure than any other Republican on Jan. 6, 2021 because Trump was calling on him to object to Biden's certification even though the vice president had no legal authority to do so in his ceremonial role presiding over the count.

Pence refused Trump's entreaties. As he hid in the Capitol during the insurrection, rioters breaking in were chanting “hang Mike Pence.”

Bringing the Senate back to session in the hours after the insurrection, Pence said he condemned the violence “in the strongest possible terms.”

“To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win,” Pence said. “Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the People’s House.”

Two weeks later, Pence attended Biden’s inauguration. Trump refused to go.

Since then, Pence has repeatedly defended his decision to abide by his constitutional role. He has called for the GOP to move on from 2020 as he lays the groundwork for a potential presidential run that could put him in direct competition with his former boss.

He reinforced his stance in a speech this year, saying that “President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election.”

Still, he has walked a careful line, praising the Trump-Pence administration’s policy accomplishments as he courts support from the party's base.

___

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.

Graham spoke emotionally and forcefully the night of the insurrection, suggesting that he would permanently break ties with Trump after the two had forged a close relationship during Trump's presidency.

“Trump and I have had a hell of a journey,” Graham said on the Senate floor in the hours after the attack. “I hate it being this way. Oh my God, I hate it. From my point of view, he has been a consequential president. But today, the first thing you will see, all I can say is, count me out. Enough is enough. I tried to be helpful.”

Graham voted to certify Biden’s victory and praised Pence for resisting the pressure to object.

In the months afterward, Graham softened his stance, and he and the former president continued to talk.

“Can we move forward without President Trump? The answer is no,” Graham told Fox News host Sean Hannity in the spring of 2021. “I’ve determined we can’t grow without him.”

___

REP. MO BROOKS, R-ALA.

Brooks is the rare House Republican to have stepped up his criticism of Trump since the insurrection.

The Alabama Republican was one of Trump’s most forceful allies on Jan. 6, 2021, telling the crowd at the rally near the White House before the riot, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.”

Brooks was one of several GOP lawmakers who tried to help Trump overturn his election defeat. Brooks said on the House floor after the violence that in his judgment, “if only lawful votes cast by eligible American citizens are counted, Joe Biden lost and President Trump won the Electoral College.”

In August, though, as he was running in a GOP primary for the Senate, Brooks told a crowd that it was time to move on from the 2020 election. Trump didn’t like that and withdrew his Senate endorsement.

Brooks claimed that Trump rescinded his support after the two had a conversation in which he told Trump there was no legal way to rescind the results or hold a “do-over” of the 2020 election.

Brooks is now in a runoff for the GOP Senate nomination, having risen in the polls after Trump dropped him. And Brooks is asking the former president to back him again.

___

REP. LIZ CHENEY, R-WYO.

Cheney has been the most prominent and consistent GOP critic of Trump — and she’s staked her political career on it.

A week after the attack, Cheney was one of only 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. In a statement, Cheney said that “the president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”

She said Trump should have intervened, but did not. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” Cheney said. “I will vote to impeach the president.”

Cheney, who was then a member of House leadership, faced immediate backlash from her party for the impeachment vote and for her forceful remarks. But she has not wavered in the year since, and accepted an invitation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to sit on the committee that is investigating the insurrection.

House Republicans booted Cheney from leadership and the party censured her and Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the only other Republican on the Jan. 6 committee. And she faces a strong challenge in the Wyoming primary from a Trump-backed candidate.

“When I know something is wrong, I will say so,” Cheney said in a campaign video announcing that she had filed for reelection. “I won’t waver or back down.”

视频播放位置 下载安装Flash播放器

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday overturned Roe v. Wade, a landmark decision that established a constitutional right to abortion in the nation nearly half a century ago.

""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. ""Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.""

""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives,"" the conservative suggested.

The court's three liberal justices dissented, saying that ""many millions of American women"" have lost a fundamental constitutional protection.

The announcement came after the Supreme Court had considered an appeal case involving a Mississippi law banning all abortions over 15 weeks gestational age except in certain circumstances.

Chief Justice John Roberts did not join the majority, arguing in a concurring opinion that he would not have overturned Roe but instead would have only upheld Mississippi's law.

Crowds on both sides of abortion rights are demonstrating near the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. throughout Friday, with the presence of police in riot gear.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security intelligence branch reportedly notified law enforcement, first responders, and private sector partners across the nation on Friday of potential domestic violence extremist activity in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion rights.

With Roe falling, more than two dozen states in the United States -- primarily in the south and midwest and controlled by Republicans -- are expected to tighten abortion access, including 13 states with ""trigger bans"" that would immediately outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned.

Governor Mike Parson tweeted Friday that Missouri ""has become the first state in the nation to effectively end abortions,"" activating a bill ending elective abortions in the state. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge later signed a certification that prohibits abortions in the state.

California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Friday signed a new law strengthening abortion rights in the state, saying he was feeling ""pissed, resolved, and angry.""

""Women are treated as second-class citizens in this country,"" Newsom said. ""Women are not as free as men. That's pretty damn sick.""

In response to the Supreme Court's ruling, U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that the court ""expressly took away a constitutional right from the American people that it had already recognized,"" calling it ""a sad day for the Court and for the country.""

""The Court literally taking America back 150 years,"" Biden said. ""Now, with Roe gone, let's be very clear: The health and life of women in this nation are now at risk.""

Republicans and religious conservatives celebrated what they see a victory. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, whose three Supreme Court picks helped solidify a conservative majority, praised its decision to overturn Roe, telling Fox News that ""this is following the Constitution, and giving rights back when they should have been given long ago.""

The issue also caused international concern. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said ""the news coming out of the United States is horrific.""

""My heart goes out to the millions of American women who are now set to lose their legal right to an abortion. I can't imagine the fear and anger you are feeling right now,"" Trudeau said. ""No government, politician, or man should tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body.""

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said that access to safe, legal, and effective abortion is firmly rooted in international human right law and is at the core of women and girls' autonomy, and ability to make their own choices about their bodies and lives, free of discrimination, violence, and coercion.

""This decision strips such autonomy from millions of women in the U.S., in particular those with low incomes and those belonging to racial and ethnic minorities, to the detriment of their fundamental rights,"" Bachelet warned.

The Supreme Court is the final appellate court of the U.S. judicial system, with the power to review and overturn lower court decisions, and is also generally the final interpreter of federal law, including the nation's constitution.

The court -- in which conservatives now have a 6-3 majority over liberals on the bench -- has recently released a series of rulings as it nears the end of the current term.

Americans' confidence in the Supreme Court has dropped sharply over the past year and reached a new low in Gallup's nearly 50-year trend.

Only 25 percent of adults across the United States say they have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court, down from 36 percent a year ago and five percentage points lower than the previous low recorded in 2014. Enditem",Q3

The man at the center of the latest high-profile police shooting between a white officer and a Black man was killed following a struggle with a Grand Rapids deputy in a neighborhood earlier this month.

During a press conference on Thursday, his parents Peter and Dorcas Lyoya spoke about their oldest son and everything they had done to give him opportunities.

Peter told the Associated Press he and his family escaped from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014 and immigrated to the United States. He said he was trying to escape violence but now fears they came here to die.

Patrick was 26, the oldest of Peter and Dorcas' six children. Peter said moving to the U.S. was supposed to bring peace and safety.

""I knew that if you met the police officer in America, that you would be safe. What is making me cry more is that my son has been killed by a police officer,"" Peter said during Thursday's press conference.

The Lyoya family spoke through an interpreter on Thursday. Dorcas fought to speak as emotions overtook her multiple times and said they thought they escaped an unsafe area where there was war in Congo.

""I’m really deeply hurt and wounded,"" she said. ""I thought I came to a safe land. I need justice for my son.""

Patrick, who has two young children of his own, worked at an auto parts factory in Grand Rapids and would visit his siblings in Lansing on weekends, his dad said.

Peter asked for justice for his son and for the police to release the officer's name. He said Patrick's brothers and sisters want to know who killed him and would like to see his picture so they can know ""this is the person that took our beloved one.""

The traffic stop was tense from the start. Video shows Lyoya getting out of the car before the officer approached. He ordered Lyoya to get back in the vehicle, but the man declined and asked why he was being pulled over.

The officer told him it was because of an issue with the license plate on the car. Then he asked Lyoya if he spoke English and demanded his driver's license. The foot chase began soon after, video shows.

Prosecutor Chris Becker will decide whether any charges are warranted but said the public shouldn't expect a quick decision. While the videos ""are an important piece of evidence, they are not all of the evidence,"" he added.

Grand Rapids Police Chief Eric Winstrom released four videos on Wednesday, nine days after Patrick was killed. The four videos were from the dashcam from the responding officer's car, the officer's bodycam, doorbell camera from a neighbor's home, and a cell phone video shot by a passenger in the car that Lyoya was driving.

The cell phone video was by far the most graphic and showed the struggle between the two men.

The officer's body camera was turned off before the shooting, which happens when a button is pushed for three seconds, Winstrom said. He said it appears it was deactivated unintentionally due to body pressure during the struggle, but he would not discuss any officer statements about it.

""That will come out once the investigation's complete,"" Winstrom said on Wednesday.

The officer who shot Lyoya has not yet been named.

Woman in critical condition after being shot, carjacked at Warren gas station

A woman was struck by gunfire and had her car stolen while she was at a gas station in Warren early Friday morning. She was taken to the hospital in critical condition after a man reportedly tapped on the window of her car at one of the gas pumps before opening fire.

The incident happened around 4 a.m. According to Warren police, the woman was parked at pump No. 5 at a Sunoco gas station on Eight Mile between Ryan and Mound Road when a white Yukon pulled up behind her.

The man got out, approached the vehicle and started firing, hitting the woman multiple times. Her car, a 2015 Nissan Altima with the license plate ELB3299 was stolen. Police say it fled westbound on Eight Mile Road. An investigation is ongoing and police are reviewing surveillance footage. The entire gas station has also been blocked off by police tape.

As is policy under the state's auto insurance reform legislation passed in 2019, residents in Michigan should receive $400 for every vehicle they had insured by that date. Car insurance companies will have until May 9 to deliver the remaining $2.1 billion.

""Thanks to our bipartisan auto insurance reform, Michigan drivers are receiving $400 refund checks per vehicle. Already, more than $906 million has been put back into the pockets of Michiganders and into our economy, and another $2.1 billion is on the way,"" said Governor Gretchen Whitmer. ""We will continue working together to put Michigan drivers first. Keep an eye out for your $400 refund!""

The money has to go through several stages before it lands in the bank accounts of drivers. After the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association decided on how much of its $5 billion surplus was to go back out to drivers, the funds needed to be sent to relevant auto insurance agencies by March 9. From there, the insurance companies will have until May 9 to deposit the funds in driver's bank accounts - or send a check.

Redford Democrat pleads guilty to operating while intoxicated

State lawmaker Mary Cavanagh pleaded guilty to operating while intoxicated, Wednesday - a misdemeanor. A Livonia Police Department body camera was rolling when an officer stopped the Democrat Redford rep back in February. She was driving on two flat tires, struggled with sobriety tests and had a blood alcohol level of .17 more than twice the legal limit.

Cavanagh posted a mea culpa to her social media accounts Wednesday: ""There is absolutely no excuse for my decision that night, and I am extremely grateful that no one was harmed, including myself."" she said.

""This is something that she will live with, but she will use her story to inspire others to gain sobriety,"" said attorney Todd Perkins, Cavanagh’s lawyer. The state rep’s plea deal hinges on her admittance into and completion of a rigorous, year-long sobriety court program. ""The purpose of it is to get you in shape mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually,"" Perkins said. ""And you need all those faculties in your life and all those intangibles in your life to be working to ensure a life of sobriety.""

Cavanagh helped create legislation allowing people to petition a judge to expunge their first-time drunk driving offenses. However, she won't benefit from it since this is her second guilty plea.

Oxford parents, students want independent review of school safety plan

A group of Oxford parents and students is asking for an independent review of the school’s safety plan since the Nov. 30 mass shooting that killed four students. ""I was in the hall right next to where it all went down,"" said student Griffen Jones. ""He turned the corner and started shooting into the crowd.""

Oxford High student Griffen Jones wants to make sure the tragedy from November 30th is never repeated again - and that he can feel safe while learning. ""It’s like we already have to go back and re-live our worst nightmare every day,"" Jones said. ""So it's real hard when it feels like my voice isn't being heard - no one's voice is being heard.""

That’s a big part of what a group of parents and students - including Jones - want, transparency in how school officials plan to keep kids safe. This group is asking for specific things:

Determination of whether the safety plan was, and is being properly followed.

A new transparent process that uses student input to create an updated school safety plan for the 2022-2023 school year.

An independent expert review of the plan.

1st COVID-19 breath test given emergency use authorization by FDA

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday issued an emergency use authorization for what it said is the first device that can detect COVID-19 in breath samples.

The InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer is about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage, the FDA said, and can be used in doctor’s offices, hospitals and mobile testing sites. The test, which can provide results in less than three minutes, must be carried out under the supervision of a licensed health care provider.

Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, called the device ""yet another example of the rapid innovation occurring with diagnostic tests for COVID-19.""

The FDA said the device was 91.2% accurate at identifying positive test samples and 99.3% accurate at identifying negative test samples.

""InspectIR expects to be able to produce approximately 100 instruments per week, which can each be used to evaluate approximately 160 samples per day,"" the agency said. ""At this level of production, testing capacity using the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer is expected to increase by approximately 64,000 samples per month.""",Q3

https://news.yahoo.com/column-democracy-failing-xi-jinping-100001343.html,"Nicholas Goldberg: Is democracy failing? Xi Jinping says it is, and he's not entirely wrong","President Biden meets virtually with Chinese President Xi Jinping in November 2021. (Susan Walsh / Associated Press)

President Biden likes to say that we are locked in a global battle pitting democracy against autocracy.

In Seattle last week, he described a phone conversation he’d had with Xi Jinping in which the Chinese leader argued that democracy doesn’t work anymore. Among other things, Xi said, democracy requires consensus, and mustering a consensus takes too long in a fast-moving world. Only autocracies are equipped to meet the extraordinary challenges of modern times.

Biden, as he does every time he tells the story, dismissed the idea that democracy is passé or unworkable.

But I’ve begun to wonder whether Xi might be on to something.

We Americans often treat our liberal democracy as a national religion, and routinely assert, as if no evidence were needed, that it is the most moral, just, effective and admirable system on Earth.

But few would deny that there’s been some disturbing evidence to the contrary in recent years.

The Jan. 6 riot, of course, was a low point. Then there was the chaotic, inefficient, politicized response to the pandemic. The continuing legislative paralysis in Washington.

The strongest evidence of democracy’s weakness, however, has got to be the tepid U.S. response to climate change over the last 25 years.

An epochal, Earth-threatening catastrophe is barreling toward us, poised to upend life as we know it. As one of the world’s wealthiest countries and greatest historic emitters of carbon, we obviously should be leading an urgent and aggressive charge to protect the planet. But we’re not.

Why have we failed to rise to the occasion? One obvious reason is that our system allows the oil and gas industry to wield grossly disproportionate power — thanks to the way money distorts our politics. The top 10 fossil fuel industry contributors alone gave $60 million to candidates in the 2019-2020 election cycle.

Another reason is that in a democracy, elected officials have no incentive to support policies that require pain and sacrifice today in exchange for future gain. Pay twice as much for gas? Don’t drive? Don’t fly? In most cases, courageous politicians who supported such policies would be voted out of office.

What’s more, too many Americans believe the climate crisis is terribly exaggerated, despite a scientific consensus that it’s not. This anti-intellectual strain has always existed in American political culture, but the number of science-skeptical voters seems to have grown during the Trump years.

I mention climate change just as an example. It is just one small part of what ails our democratic system these days.

Even post-Trump, we face a deep, bitter, partisan polarization. A dysfunctional Congress. An ongoing effort to undermine the 2020 election. An assault on voting rights.

Add to that a host of long-standing structural problems.

A U.S. Senate in which tiny states like Wyoming, with 582,000 people, have the same representation and voting power as big states like California, with 39 million people.

A system that allows congressional district lines to be manipulated for partisan advantage.

Campaign finance laws that let mega-rich Americans and giant corporations spend unlimited amounts to influence elections.

An anachronistic electoral college and filibuster rules that are undermining the notion of majority rule.

And good luck fixing these problems. Making reforms and passing laws in a country this divided is extremely difficult, and amending the Constitution is nearly impossible. A newly empowered conservative Supreme Court won’t make it easier.

In recent years, Freedom House, which rates and ranks democracies around the world, has downgraded the U.S. so that it now ranks close to Panama and Romania, and 10 points below ""traditional peers"" such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

And it’s true that the United States has never lived up to its own lofty ideals. Liberty, equality, fairness, the evenhanded rule of law — these are aspirations, not yet achievements.

Given all this, is it any surprise that Xi and many others believe our system is dysfunctional?

But here’s the flip side: Despite democracy’s glaring flaws, autocracy isn’t the answer. Those who see hope in the Orbans, the Le Pens and the Trumps, much less in the Xis and Putins, should think again.

Freedom House, for the record, says China is “increasingly repressive” and is “tightening control over all aspects of life.” Describing Russia, Freedom House refers to “loyalist security forces, a subservient judiciary, a controlled media environment, and a legislature consisting of a ruling party and pliable opposition factions.”

These are not the conditions under which most people would choose to live. But beyond that, there’s no evidence — despite Xi’s assertions — that China or any other autocratic country has a much better track record on addressing climate change or solving its domestic problems.

“The problems attributed to democracy, particularly regarding crises like climate change, are real and worthy of concern — I lose sleep over them,” says Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard and co-author of “How Democracies Die.” “But the fact that democracies are bad at responding to serious challenges that require either rapid decision-making or long-term thinking does not mean autocracies are any better.”

Levitsky says that history is littered with disastrous authoritarian experiments and that Xi is not the first to claim his authoritarian system is better than democracy. The Soviets and the fascists said the same.

The unsatisfying reality is that democracy is difficult work. Americans need to fix the Senate. Disentangle money and campaigns. Ban gerrymandering. Restore democratic norms.

To do so, citizens must understand the issues, vote their consciences, agitate for change — and act cooperatively, even with opponents.

We have a long distance to go (and with regard to climate change, very little time).

But democracy is a long-term project. It doesn’t come wrapped in bright colors with a bow around it. You’ve got to fight for it.

UVALDE, Texas — A Texas state senator has said that the 18-year-old shooter who killed 18 students at an elementary school in this rural southern Texas town was from North Dakota.

Salvador Ramos was born here, according to State Sen. Roland Guitierrez, who made the comment in an interview on CNN. He said he was told about Ramos' past by Texas state police.

Reuters reported that the teenage gunman opened fire at the school, killing 18 children and three adults before he was also killed by law enforcement.

Ramos was acting alone, according to Reuters, and a motive was unknown. He also reportedly shot and killed his grandmother before going to the school, CBS News reported.

Gutierrez said Ramos bought the firearms on his 18th birthday, legally, from a dealer. Full story here.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2367656/power-outages-test-lahores-patience,Power outages test Lahore’s patience,"Scheduled and unscheduled electricity load-shedding is on the rise in the provincial capital and adjoining areas, routinely making the lives of citizens difficult. Power utility consumers staged protests in several areas against the frequent power outages and inflated electricity tariffs.

Hundreds participated in the protests on Raiwind Road, Kahna and other areas, chanting slogans against the government, power companies, frequent power failures and exorbitant electricity tariffs.

Speaking to The Express Tribune on Sunday, Allah Rakha, a resident of a town near Raiwind Road, said that he and his neighbours are experiencing 10 to 12 hours of load-shedding amid hot and humid weather. “We have lodged dozens of complaints with the power utility company but nobody is ready to resolve them,” he added.

A resident of Johar Town named Muhammad Taha said that he is a student and lives in a private hostel on the UMT Road. Frequent power outages in the area have become unbearable for students preparing for their examinations. “We have to endure eight to 10 hours of load-shedding daily, amid hot and humid weather. We have grown tired and cannot concentrate on our studies.

The government should issue strict directions to power utility companies to announce load-shedding schedule beforehand, so citizens can plan their routines around the outages,” he said.

Another citizen, Usman Butt, said that the government has multiplied electricity tariffs over the last several months, in spite of the increased frequency of power outages.

Ahead of the recent Punjab by-elections, the ruling party announced waiver of electricity bills for consumers with a monthly power consumption of up to 100 units. Usman stated that small consumers in his neighbourhood received a bill of over Rs4,000 for consumption of around 94 units. Similar complaints were made by several other citizens from different areas of the city.

Contrary to public complaints, an official of the Lahore Electricity Supply Company (LESCO) claimed that the company is conducting two h ours of load-shedding daily in urban areas and four hours in rural areas.

Presently, the company has a demand of around 4,400MW, while it is getting a supply of 4,100 to 4,200MW of electricity from the national grid.

The people of Lahore have been bracing this menace, especially since the beginning of this month.

People from various areas of the city have missed no opportuninty of conveying their ordeal through the media and other channels.

On July 5, many people, while speaking to The Express Tribune, complained that unscheduled power outages were disrupting routine life in different areas of the provincial metropolis

Residents from a neighbourhood in Ghari Shahu also staged a protest demonstration against the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco).

They highlighted that the power utility company had failed to ensure consistent supply of electricity in their area.

A resident of the locality, Sheikh Naveed, pointed out that the power transformer of their area had exploded twice during past two weeks [the first week of July and the last one of June].

Residents of the area had made numerous complaints to Lesco for replacement of the under-capacity transformer but officials of the power company were not paying attention to their complaints, he said.

Ron DeSantis speaks during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit held at the Tampa Convention Center on July 22, 2022.

PUNTA GORDA, Fla.—Gov. Ron DeSantis removed a Hillsborough County state attorney on Aug. 4 because he did not follow the rule of law.

At a press conference on Aug. 5, Florida’s governor said he suspended Andrew Warren, who represented the 13th judicial circuit in Hillsborough County, on the basis of “neglect of duty.”

The accusation stems from 2020 when Black Lives Matter riots hit Tampa; cars were set ablaze and police officers were barricaded in their patrol cars.

Hillsborough County sheriff Chad Chronister said, “no one was ever prosecuted even though arrests were made.”

“We are resolved to apprehend the criminals who prey upon law-abiding citizens in our community, it’s our duty—and we trust that our criminal justice system, the state attorney, and the public defender will adjudicate the circumstances and hold those who are guilty accountable,” Chronister said at the Aug. 4 press conference.

The governor exercised his executive powers to bar Warren from office and suspend his wages after an investigation.

“As I saw that happening across the country earlier this year I asked my staff in my office to look around the state and to make sure that wasn’t going to happen here, where you would have individual prosecutors nullify laws that were enacted by the people’s representatives. They spoke with law enforcement throughout the state, they spoke with line prosecutors throughout the state,” DeSantis said at his Aug. 5 press conference.

In addition to not prosecuting criminals, Warren has publicly objected to prosecuting people under Florida’s newly enacted 15-week abortion ban and has signaled that he supports gender-affirming treatments for trans minors, which DeSantis has condemned.

But the governor says that Warren’s lack of “following the rule of law” is the reason for his suspension.

“Our government is a government of laws, not a government of men, and what that means is that we govern ourselves based on a Constitutional system, and based on the rule of law,” DeSantis said.

“What we’ve seen over the past few years is individual prosecutors take it upon themselves to determine which laws they like and will enforce, and which laws they don’t like and don’t enforce.”

Griffin said the governor reviewed the “findings” and was left with no choice but to exercise his authority as set out in the Florida Constitution.

DeSantis told reporters that “social justice policies” created under “rogue” prosecutors have been “devastating to the rule of law,” in addition, it hurts “working-class communities and undermines public safety.”

Grady Judd, “America’s Sheriff,” as he has been dubbed, agreed with the governor’s decision.

“We’ve got a dumpster fire going on in this nation,” Judd said during the conference. “And you know who’s getting burned in this dumpster fire? The working people.”

Judd said cities like New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Chicago had prosecutors who had “signed the same pledges as Warren” had the highest murder rates in the country, and that “criminals weren’t being held accountable.”

After the findings were in DeSantis said he found law enforcement was “frustrated” over putting their lives on the line, arresting suspects, and filling out paperwork—just to have the criminals “turned loose.”

“It all came back to this area in the 13th Judicial Circuit in Hillsborough County,” DeSantis said. “The response we got was a lot of frustration on the part of law enforcement for criminals being let go and crimes not being prosecuted.”

The suspension came after Warren was “putting himself publicly above the law,” DeSantis said.

Chronister said Warren’s suspension “is not political to me, it’s about law and order” and making sure the community was safe.

He said Warren had been “reducing charges, dropping cases, and single-handedly determining which crimes would be legal or illegal in our county.”

Chronister recalled a September 2021 case where a suspect had “shot someone, then opened fire on a residence where the victim sought refuge and protection.”

The suspect was arrested, released from jail, and arrested again on burglary charges.

Chronister said Warren did not press charges because the depositions “would have been too lengthy and complicated.”

After his suspension, Warren issued a written statement calling the governor’s actions a “political stunt” and an “illegal overreach.”

“It spits in the face of the voters of Hillsborough County who have twice elected me to serve them, not Ron DeSantis,” Warren wrote.

“Just because the governor violates your rights, it doesn’t mean they don’t exist.”

Two gubernatorial candidates vying to represent the Democratic party in November spoke out against Warren’s suspension.

U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist said DeSantis was a “wannabe dictator” and Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried called DeSantis a “pathetic bully” who “wants to be a dictator, not a governor of Florida.”

Both Democratic candidates said DeSantis’ decision was “politically motivated.”

The Florida Senate would have to remove Warren from office and he is only suspended at this point.

Warren took office in 2016 and was reelected in 2020 and has been described as a “rising star” in the Democrat party.",Q3

LINCOLN, Neb. (KLKN) – Troopers uncovered 20 pounds of meth buried in a field near Norfolk on Wednesday, the Nebraska State Patrol said.

Around 6:30 a.m., residents of Winside, a village northeast of Norfolk, reported two suspicious people on their property.

Troopers arrived and found Oscar Villa, 36, and Johana Madrid, 27, both in possession of suspected meth, according to the patrol.

In a search of the surrounding area, troopers located a handgun and a stolen cattle prod from a nearby farm.

Shortly after, the cattle prod’s owner found a bag containing about one-half pound of suspected meth in a nearby truck, the patrol said.

During an investigation, troopers believed that more meth had been buried in a field where Villa and Madrid were initially found.

Eventually, troopers came across a bag containing around 20 pounds of suspected meth and three grams of suspected fentanyl, according to the patrol.

Villa, of Los Angeles, Califonia, was arrested on suspicion of terroristic threats, possession of controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver, possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, use of a firearm to commit a felony and other charges.

Villa is now behind bars in the Antelope County Jail, the patrol said.

Madrid, who is also from Los Angeles, was arrested on suspicion of possessing a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver, possession of drug-related items and theft.

The 71-year-old woman from West Chester, Pennsylvania, suffered injuries that were not life-threatening in the encounter Wednesday, the park said in a statement.

She and her daughter were returning to their vehicle at a trailhead when they inadvertently approached bison, and a bull bison charged her, the officials said.

It was the third time a bison has attacked a visitor at Yellowstone this year and the second time this week.

On May 30, an Ohio woman was thrown 10 feet after, officials say, she approached a bison that was near a boardwalk.

On Monday, a Colorado man was gored by a bull bison, also near a boardwalk. In that case, the man was with family members when the bison charged, and they did not leave right away as park staff members recommend, park officials said.

Video appeared to show the man grab a child to move it out of the animal’s path before he was struck. The man, 34, suffered an injury to his arm, the park said at the time.

Visitors are warned to give bison, as well as other wildlife, space — even if the animals are near parking lots or other developed areas. ""If need be, turn around and go the other way to avoid interacting with a wild animal in close proximity,"" the park said Thursday.

The two most recent encounters both involved bulls, or male, bison, park officials said. Bull bison can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand 6 feet tall.

The two most recent encounters occurred after Yellowstone reopened part of the park to visitors following severe flooding, most seriously in the northern section, earlier this month.

The park closed to all visitors on June 13. The flood and the mudslides washed out roads and caused other damage, and they also affected the ""gateway communities"" and the businesses that depend on travelers to the park.

The south loop reopened with some restrictions on June 22, and Yellowstone said Thursday it expects to reopen the north loop Sunday.

“We have attempted to balance major recovery efforts while reopening as much of the park as possible,” Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement.",Q3
https://www.theepochtimes.com/dead-oklahoma-inmate-was-suing-over-baby-shark-claim_4725902.html,Dead Oklahoma Inmate Was Suing Over ‘Baby Shark’ Claim,"OKLAHOMA CITY—An Oklahoma County inmate found dead in his jail cell over the weekend was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the county alleging that in 2019, he and other inmates were tortured by jail employees who forced them to repeatedly listen to the children’s song “Baby Shark” for hours.

John Basco, 48, was found unresponsive in his cell early Sunday morning, Oklahoma County Detention Center officials said in a news release. He was pronounced dead after jail workers began lifesaving efforts, they said. Basco’s death is the 14th this year at the jail, which has faced criticism over inmate deaths, escapes, and other incidents.

Jail spokesman Mark Opgrande said there were no obvious signs of foul play and that investigators will look into the possibility of a drug overdose. The State Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the cause of death.

Basco, who was booked into the jail Thursday on a drug trafficking complaint, was among a group of inmates suing the county in federal court for allegedly being handcuffed to a wall and forced to listen to the song “Baby Shark” on repeat for hours during separate incidents in 2019. A jail lieutenant retired and two detention officers were fired in connection with the incidents, and all three face misdemeanor charges.

Basco’s attorney, Cameron Spradling, told The Oklahoman that he found the circumstances surrounding Basco’s death “disturbing” and called for the preservation of all evidence as the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation probe of it unfolds.

Oklahoma prison records show Basco had a long history of criminal convictions in Oklahoma County dating back to the mid 1990s, mostly for drug, property, and firearms crimes.

GENEVA, Sept. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On Tuesday 27 September, the issues of human rights and political oppression in Benin were raised at the 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, composed of 47 member states, in which Benin is occupying a seat until 2024.

An oral statement co-sponsored by two NGOs, CAP/ Liberté de Conscience (France) and Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF) expressed their deep concerns about the ongoing backsliding of democracy and human rights in Benin since President Patrice Talon came to power in 2016.

On the same day, HRWF launched its report about the situation in Benin in which the Brussels-based NGO focused on several topics of particular concern, and primarily the grip of President Talon on all the state institutions to the benefit of his party.

Other issues are also investigated by the report, such as

The massive arrests of peaceful demonstrators, political opponents and party leaders in 2021

The loss of independence of the judiciary

The creation of a special court for the prosecution of economic crimes and terrorism (CRIET) instrumentalized by President Talon to prosecute political rivals on fabricated charges

The sentencing of two candidates of the 2021 presidential election, Reckya Madougou and Joël Aivo, respectively sentenced to 20 and 10 years in prison

The general detention conditions in Benin , also denounced in the 2021 of the US State Department on Human Rights Practices in Benin

, also denounced in the 2021 of the US State Department on Human Rights Practices in The abuse of pretrial detention and the use of torture, already denounced in 2019 by the UN Committee Against Torture

The lack of freedom of the media, journalists and bloggers

The breaches of freedom of assembly and police violence

In their oral statement, the two NGOs recalled that in May 2021, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted a Resolution in which it declared to be deeply concerned by the restrictions on civic space and the crackdown on demonstrations by the army resulting in loss of lives, abuses and violations.

Last but not least, HRWF report also mentions a call of the New York Center for Foreign Policy Affairs to the US at the end of a 73-page study to recommend the nomination of President Talon and his supporting associates for sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act.

On the same lines, HRWF also recommends the nomination of President Talon and his associates for sanctions under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime.

https://www.massdevice.com/boston-scientific-stock-q2-2022/,Boston Scientific stock up on Street-beating Q2,"Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) shares are up today on strong second-quarter results that topped the consensus forecast.

BTIG analysts Marie Thibault and Sam Eiber reiterated their Buy rating: “The revenue beat was broad-based, with growth in each region, share wins in mature markets, and a rebound in the APAC region.”

“We believe that the [Q2 2022] results show that BSX is more insulated from macro headwinds than some of its large-cap peers, and we reiterate our Buy rating,” said Needham & Co. senior research analyst Mike Matson.

Shares of BSX were up more than 5% at $39.89 apiece by midday trading today. MassDevice‘s MedTech 100 Index, which includes stocks of the world’s largest medical device companies, was up slightly.

The Marlborough, Massachusetts–based company posted profits of $246 million, or 17¢ per share, on sales of $3.24 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022, for a 43% bottom-line gain on sales growth of 5.4%.

Adjusted to exclude one-time items, earnings per share were 44¢, 2¢ ahead of Wall Street, where analysts were looking for sales of $3.22 billion.

Each of Boston Scientific’s specific business arms saw year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter, bar its neuromodulation business (down 3.4%). Urology and pelvic health posted the strongest performance (revenues rose 13.4%), while cardiology grew 7.6%. MedSurg saw a revenue rise of 4.5% overall.

“We had another quarter of excellent performance, a testament to the talent of our global team, the sustainability and diversification of our innovative medical technology portfolio and our strong market positions amid continued macroeconomic challenges,” said Mike Mahoney, chair and CEO, Boston Scientific. “As we continue to execute our strategy, we have a tremendous opportunity to continue to deliver on our promise to bring life-changing devices and therapies to more patients who need them.”

Boston Scientific said it now expects to log adjusted EPS of between $1.74 and $1.77, lowering the high end of its previous projection of $1.74 to $1.79. The company expects sales growth for the full year to range between 6.5% and 7.5% — down from a previous range between 7% and 9%.",Q3
https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/08/21/rushdie-stabbing-reminds-us-that-iran-is-still-worlds-leading-terror-state/,Rushdie Stabbing Reminds Us That Iran Is Still World’s Leading Terror State,"Last week, a man stormed the stage at the Chautauqua Institution and stabbed British author Salman Rushdie in the neck as he was being introduced. The topic under discussion was “the United States as asylum for writers and other artists in exile and as a home for freedom of creative expression.” Chances are exceptionally high that this was the work of a jihadi.

The story attracted shamefully fleeting attention. For those too young to remember, “The Satanic Verses” was published back in September 1988. And because of the book’s purportedly impertinent treatment of the prophet Muhammad, it was banned in Rushdie’s native India and dozens of other nations—including virtually every Muslim-majority country in the world. Though Rushdie would later become a powerful advocate of free expression, he initially turned on his own book, apologizing numerous times for its contents. “I profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam,” he said in one statement, asking his publisher to hold back release of the paperback edition of the book. As a matter of self-preservation, his position was understandable.

And, still, it was all to no avail. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Rushdie, contending that even if the author “became the most pious man of all time” it was the duty of every Muslim to “employ everything he has got” to murder the writer.

For the first time in postwar history, terrorism was aimed at suppressing free expression in the liberal Western world. In the United States, two bookstores in Berkeley, California, were attacked. The Riverdale Press in New York was firebombed after publishing an editorial defending the right to read the novel and criticizing the bookstores that pulled it from their shelves. Rushdie’s Japanese translator Hitoshi Igarashi was fatally stabbed. In Europe, the Italian translator of “The Satanic Verses,” Ettore Capriolo, was also stabbed in his apartment in Milan, and the Norwegian publisher of Rushdie’s book, William Nygaard, was shot three times, but both survived. In Belgium, an imam and his aide were murdered after expressing moderate positions on the affair. Big booksellers in London were firebombed in April 1989, and there were two more explosions connected to the selling of the book and a handful of unexploded devices in other bookstores. Rushdie, author of the masterpiece “Midnight’s Children” among many other fantastic works, was forced to employ round-the-clock protection by bodyguards, compelled to spend the next decade in hiding.

The point of the fatwa was not only to punish Rushdie for blasphemy but to intimidate others from daring to engage. It worked. As I note in detail in my recent book, Europe—and to a lesser extent, the United States—began to self-censor any topic that might offend Islamic theocrats. No one should be guaranteed a job or a book, of course, but folding to illiberal pressure only incentivizes more threats and violence, as we saw with Charlie Hebdo and the numerous other attacks that followed. More recently, the left has simply begun smearing anyone who noted the illiberalism of political Islam as an Islamophobe. As author Kenan Malik noted, the legacy of the Rushdie fatwa was that Western Europe had “internalized” censorship. “Rushdie’s critics lost the battle—The Satanic Verses continues to be published,” he wrote. “But they won the war. The argument at the heart of the anti-Rushdie case—that it is morally unacceptable to cause offence to other cultures—is now widely accepted.” Rushdie has rightly called this capitulation “censorship by fear.”

We should not forget, even as the Biden administration is trying to strike another sweetheart deal that would ultimately give the mullahs nuclear weapons, that this is the work of the theocratic terror state of Iran. Even if this attacker is non-jihadi, the fact is that the fatwa still stands today. In 2016, Iran raised it to nearly $4 million. When Iran isn’t destabilizing the Middle East through proxies or blowing up Jewish centers in Argentina or intimidating American voters or plotting to kill former American officials or murdering over 600 U.S. soldiers in Iraq, they are funding bounties against innocent writers.

https://wvrecord.com/stories/630694339-woman-says-authorities-kept-her-from-filming-state-senate-abortion-debate,Woman says authorities kept her from filming state Senate abortion debate,"CHARLESTON – Two lawsuits have been filed accusing state officials and employees of violating a Greenbrier County woman’s right to record public government proceedings.

Morgan Walton filed the complaints August 22. One was filed in Kanawha Circuit Court against the West Virginia State Senate and the state Division of Protective Services. The second was filed in federal court against state Senate President Craig Blair, state Senate Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms Grover Miller, DPS Director Kevin Foreman and DPS officer Van Armsrrong.

The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed complaints on behalf of Walton.



Blair

According to the court filings, officials barred members of the public from recording debate on House Bill 302 related to abortion access in the state during a July 29 special session. Walton was threatened with arrest after she tried to record the proceedings in the state Senate chambers.

Walton says she was allowed to record debate on Gov. Jim Justice’s proposed tax bill, but she says authorities intervened almost immediately when she began filming debate on the abortion bill. Walton told Armstrong, a Capitol Police officer, she was within her rights to record the debate in a non-disruptive manner. She says Armstrong laughed at her and threatened to arrest her if she did not leave the gallery.

In doing so, she says officials violated her First Amendment rights and the West Virginia Open Governmental Proceedings Act, which is a “sunshine law” designed to ensure government transparency.

“The Constitution, court rulings and state law are all quite clear: members of the public have every right to record public officials during public proceedings,” ACLU-WV staff attorney Nick Ward said. “Sunshine laws lie at the very heart of our democracy.

“Without transparency, government cannot be held accountable by the people it serves. That’s why we’re also asking a court to remind politicians at the state Capitol of their responsibility to uphold and protect transparency laws.”

In the federal complaint, Walton says her free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution were violated. In the state court complaint, she says the state Open meetings Act was violated.

According to a 2019 advisory opinion from the West Virginia Ethics Commission’s Committee on Open Governmental Meetings, Ward says Walton’s right to film is protected under the statute.

The complaints say emergency preliminary relief is needed because the state Senate and its committees are scheduled to meet to discuss the issue, at the latest, September 11-13.

“Emergency preliminary relief is appropriate as it is the only mechanism to ensure Ms. Walton’s rights will be protected and that she will be free from retaliation when observing imminent Senate proceedings,” the complaints state. “Ms. Walton alleges that the West Virginia Senate and the Capitol Police have a custom, pattern, practice or policy of authorizing agents to retaliate against individuals for exercising their right to record public government proceedings.”

Blair did not return a message seeking comment.

Walton says the actions of the defendants violated her rights and caused emotional trauma, humiliation and distress. She seeks declaratory judgments saying the defendants violated her rights to observe and record government actions. She also seeks immediate emergency and injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from prohibiting individuals to observe and record open governmental proceedings. She also seeks court costs, expenses, attorney fees and other relief.

She is being represented in both cases by Loree Stark and Nicholas Ward of ACLU-WV. The Kanawha Circuit Court case has been assigned to Circuit Judge Carrie Webster.

Srinagar: Three terrorists were killed as security forces foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control (LoC) in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, police said on Thursday.

The infiltration attempt was foiled near Madiyan Nanak post in Kamalkote area of Uri sector in north Kashmir's Baramulla district.

Army troopers noticed suspicious movement along the LoC in Kamalkote area of Uri sector in north Kashmir's Baramulla district, officials said earlier.

They said the troops challenged the intruders and there was an exchange of fire.

Infiltration attempts on downward trend

In March this year, the Centre informed the Lok Sabha that infiltration across the Line of Control (LoC) has decreased significantly since 2018 in Jammu and Kashmir, and between 2018 and 2021, an estimation of 366 infiltrations were reported on the border.

Union Minister for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai Home Nityanand has given a written reply to the question of Lok Sabha MP Ranjanben Dhananjay Bhatt.

He said, “The infiltration across the Line of Control (LoC) has decreased significantly since 2018 in Jammu and Kashmir. The Estimated Net Infiltration during the last four years is 366.”

LoC barrier fence

India constructed a 550-kilometre barrier along the 740 kilometres LoC by 2004. The fence generally remains about 140 metres on the Indian-controlled side.

Its stated purpose is to exclude arms smuggling and infiltration by Pakistani-based separatist militants.

The barrier, referred to as an Anti-Infiltration Obstacle System (AIOS), consists of double-row of fencing and concertina wire 8–12 feet in height, and is electrified and connected to a network of motion sensors, thermal imaging devices, lighting systems and alarms.

They act as ""fast alert signals"" for the Indian troops, who can be alerted and ambush the infiltrators trying to sneak in.

According to Indian military sources, the fence has reduced the numbers of militants who routinely cross into the Indian side of the disputed region by 80%. In 2017, a proposal for an upgraded smart fence on the Indian side was accepted.

The capital city police, through its Twitter account, rejected the notion and clarified that heavy police presence outside Imran’s residence was to disperse a protest staged by teachers from Punjab, where the PTI is back in power.

Footage being shared on social media showed that police personnel and vehicles were present at Banigala, while its entry and exit points were blocked.

Responding to the footage, the Islamabad police said: “The police security was deployed yesterday due to the protest of the teachers of Punjab. All the protesters were dispersed only last evening. There was no such activity around Banigala house today.”

The police said “wrong information” was being spread among the public via the video and requested people to desist from spreading such information without verification.

The Islamabad police also requested provincial governments to resolve such matters at their level.

On Tuesday, teachers and clerks associations had threatened to stage a protest outside Imran’s residence on August 11 against the appointment of the District Education Authority’s chief executive officer.

The protesters had carried placards, chanted slogans against the Punjab government and demanded to withdraw the decision of appointing a new chief executive officer.

Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly filed a motion Monday questioning whether the transfer would really be necessary.

""Sheriff Gentry is willing to assist the State and the Court if necessary; however, it appears that there may have been a miscommunication between the Sheriff and defense counsel regarding the necessity for the Defendant to be housed in Cullman County,"" Connolly wrote.

He added that he had spoken with state officials who told him that prison authorities ensured him that all the defense counsel’s requests for access to White had been accommodated.

""Based on the foregoing, the State moves the court to set this matter for a hearing regarding the above-referenced motion to determine whether it is necessary to house Defendant in the Cullman County Jail pending the trial of this matter,"" Connolly concluded.

The district attorney told Fox News Digital Monday he had no comment beyond what was written in his filing.

Gentry’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital Monday.

In a statement to local media Friday, Gentry said he had been misquoted in the defense motion, which states ""he is ready and willing to house Mr. White.""

""This quote is not correct, as it makes it appear that we are eagerly seeking to house Mr. White,"" he told the Huntsville-based WAFF-TV. ""As I told Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, and the Casey White legal team when we spoke, if the judge in the case ordered Mr. White be housed in the Cullman County Detention Center, my deputies, my command staff and I will make sure Mr. White is well guarded. He will be kept in solitary confinement 23 hours a day, only being allowed 1 hour in the exercise yard while still under guard, as mandated by law.""

White, who allegedly escaped a Lauderdale County jail with the help of now-deceased prison official Vicky White, no relation, was recaptured in Indiana after 11 days on the run. He is currently being housed at the William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Jefferson County, but his defense team, which includes the Huntsville-based attorney Mark McDaniel, wants to have him housed at the Cullman County Detention Center, which is about half as far away as the state prison.

McDaniel did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

White was already serving a 75-year prison sentence when he was transferred from Donaldson to the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence to stand trial there on unrelated murder charges in the death of Ridgeway, 58, a killing to which authorities say he confessed in 2020 before pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Several inmates have escaped the Cullman jail in recent years, raising concern for a relative of White's alleged victim.

""For obvious reasons, we're very opposed to moving him to a less secure facility, for his safety as much as anyone else's,"" Austin Williams, Ridgeway’s son, told Fox News Digital on Friday.

He previously told Fox News Digital that he had no idea White had been transferred to Lauderdale before the May escape and is pushing for a new law that would require authorities to inform victims’ families whenever an inmate is moved to a new facility.

White could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Ridgeway. The trial is scheduled to begin on Dec. 12.

https://www.jpost.com/international/article-715228,Momentous changes with the relationship between Russia and Saudi Arabia - opinion,"On the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum last June, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said relations between the kingdom and Russia are as warm as the weather in Riyadh. This description summarizes the current state of strategic cooperation between the two countries. This state of affairs angers Riyadh’s strategic allies in the West, primarily, of course, the United States.

But it remains the best option for Saudi foreign policy in light of overall circumstances and the realities of the existing world order. Of course, everyone in the region and internationally is waiting to see the results and implications of US President Joe Biden’s visit to Saudi Arabia, last month.

In particular, there were unspoken expectations or aspirations that Saudi Arabia might oblige its US partner by increasing oil production in isolation from its OPEC+ fellow members, although Riyadh has repeatedly stressed that this issue is not on the table.

Then there was a recent telephone conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman confirming that this influence is limited, if not absent altogether.

What are the changes?

SAUDI KING SALMAN and Russian President Vladimir Putin attend a welcoming ceremony at the Kremlin on October 5. (credit: REUTERS)

The strategic vision of oil-producing countries, both within and outside OPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Russia, is certainly based on an objective view of markets and the need to maintain their stability and balance. This is critical for both exporters and consumers.

Meanwhile, the US and its Atlantic allies are under tremendous domestic economic pressure from policies for that others are not responsible. They want to subordinate the policies of oil producers to those policies and use that production to isolate and punish Russia. These are things that others have nothing to do with.

In fact, they expose the interests of their states and peoples to significant strategic losses. The recent conversation was not only an affirmation of the strength of the Saudi-Russian relationship, but also underscored how committed Saudi oil policy is to maintaining balance in energy markets. This is consistent with the Kingdom’s status and growing global strategic weight.

I think the problem with US foreign policy right now is that executive and legislative policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the changes that are taking place, whether in the status and global standing of the US or its traditional allies. They only want to maintain the outdated equations on which those alliance relationships were based.

Times have changed, yet they fail to change with the times. This alliance should be addressed realistically rather than continuing to operate under the old vision that no longer reflects reality of international relations. Another US problem in this context is unilateralism.

This overly self-serving behavior is forcing many allies to rethink this alliance or at least structure it according to a new framework that takes into account evolving strategic variables. Washington has demonstrated its propensity to abandon its allies in any crisis. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now

THERE IS a serious tendency to plunge some allies into fateful and perhaps existential crises, as Washington only considers its interests and conflicts with strategic adversaries and rivals. The point here is not to justify the new orientations of Washington’s allies in the Gulf region; rather, it is an attempt to understand the overall context of events.

These developments are influenced by what is happening around them at the global level, as they reflect the growing strategic interests of these allies, interests that require building a broad global network of cooperative relationships with all emerging international powers because their interests and commonalities overlap with all of them.

One of the most important commonalities is the coordination between Saudi Arabia and Russia to maintain the stability and balance of oil markets, and to account for the interests of both producers and consumers. Needless to say, the US recognizes the importance of keeping the channels of communication open to all.

They strive to do so, whether in relations with China or with Russia, despite all the tensions and difficult circumstances that those relations go through. But when it comes to the foreign policy of other countries, Washington believes that this ally should say no to any other partnerships that contradict what the American side sees. These behavioral tendencies seem overly selfish. They pose the biggest threat to the continuity of the historic alliance relationships between the US and its GCC allies.

Even Israel, Washington’s closest and most influential strategic ally in the Middle East, has not fared unscathed by this practice. We have seen the differences that arise from time to time from the tumultuous development of Israeli-Chinese relations.

The only way out of this American dilemma is not to constantly try to disrupt or restrict Russian-Saudi or Russian-Gulf relations. This is a far-fetched fictional scenario, at least in light of current realities and circumstances. It is to evolve US strategic concepts of international relations and to form new conceptions of partnership and alliance with other countries. These relationships need to respond to the changes and circumstances of the times and to US circumstances, interests and real needs. They need to move away from overestimating or underestimating both its own capabilities and the capabilities of others to move and maneuver politically and strategically.

Quite simply, the US must recognize that the rules of international relations have shifted in the mid-twentieth century. Maintaining alliances and partnership relationships mandates attention to the interests of both sides.

It requires mutual respect and recognition, great flexibility, a more realistic view and consideration of variables, and evidence of strong interdependence between strategic partners. Saudi-Russian relations are advancing. Day by day, they prove that they have elements of strength and continuity.

This does not detract from the importance of Saudi-US relations. But Washington must seriously address the current geopolitical variables. It must recognize that the Gulf is not just about oil but also about a wide web of mutually strategic interests.",Q3

The national uproar over reproductive rights has the potential to reverberate in Oregon’s general election this November, according to a new voter survey.

Oregon already has some of the strongest abortion rights protection laws in the nation, and requires private health insurance and state Medicaid to cover the cost of the procedure. Given redistricting, control of the state legislature is likely to remain firmly in Democratic hands, which means that the right to seek an abortion in the state is not in immediate jeopardy. (Abortion rights advocates do say that local wait times to have the procedure could get longer as abortion seekers from other states pour into the Pacific Northwest for care.)

But the threat to reproductive rights is a potent political issue—consider Kansas, a conservative-leaning state where voters turned out in droves during a recent primary to squash a proposed ban on the procedure. And in a year when Oregon’s gubernatorial race is expected to be very tight given the presence of three credible candidates, it could emerge as a decisive issue and turnout driver for key voters.

A survey of 1,572 Oregon residents conducted in mid-July by the Oregon Values and Beliefs Center found that 72 percent of respondents felt abortion should be legal in some or all cases, a stronger showing of support than the 61 percent of voters nationwide who favor reproductive rights.

And though a plurality of voters (46 percent) told survey takers that the Supreme Court’s actions wouldn’t affect their voting decisions in November, nearly as many Oregonians (44 percent) said it would be a factor. Moreover, those who said it would be a consideration were ten times more likely to vote in the general election, according to the poll results.

The poll also found that Democrats and women were the most motivated to vote in November, with 54 percent of Democrats planning to cast their ballots and 43 percent of women, compared with 38 percent of Independents, 30 percent of Republican,s and 37 percent of men.

Two of the three candidates for governor—Democrat Tina Kotek and Democrat-turned non-affiliated candidate Betsy Johnson, have trumpeted their support for reproductive rights in interviews and via social media. Republican Christine Drazan has not focused on the issue, but did greet the news of the Supreme Court’s decision by tweeting “Life wins!”

That stance could spell trouble for Drazan, particularly in the voter-rich Portland suburbs. The poll found that 65 percent of voters living in Washington, Clackamas, and Multnomah Counties said they were likely to favor candidates who supported reproductive rights; statewide, 58 percent of Oregonians said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who supported the right to choose whether or not to get an abortion.

The poll’s margin of error was 2.47 percent.",Q3

Wade was overturned, the landscape of abortion access is still shifting significantly in some states, sometimes very quickly.

Changing restrictions and litigation in neighboring Indiana and Ohio this week illustrate the whiplash for providers and patients navigating sudden changes in what is allowed where.

Sister clinics who just weeks ago were sending patients from Ohio, where most abortions were banned, to Indiana, where the procedure was allowed, have now flip-flopped roles after the two states’ access restrictions reversed, at least temporarily.

Here is a deeper look at the current state of the shifting national landscape:

WHAT CHANGED THIS WEEK?

An Ohio judge blocked enforcement on Wednesday of the state’s ban on most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected. The ban had been in effect since shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe on June 24. The judge’s action allows abortions to resume in pregnancies up to 20 weeks’ gestation for 14 days.

Then, on Thursday, a new Indiana law took effect that bans most abortions, marking its status as the first state in the nation to approve new abortion restrictions since the high court’s abortion ruling. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb signed the ban into law Aug. 5.

Under the new law, abortions are permitted only in cases of rape and incest before 10-weeks post-fertilization; to protect the life and physical health of the patient; or if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly. A doctor who performs an illegal abortion or who fails to file required reports must lose their medical license.

HOW IS THIS AFFECTING PROVIDERS?

All seven Indiana abortion clinics lost their licenses Thursday under the state’s new law, which allows abortions to only be performed in hospitals or outpatient surgical centers owned by hospitals. More than 98% of the state’s abortions were done by those clinics in 2021.

Abortion clinics in the state told The Associated Press they will remain open to refer patients out of state, including to neighboring Ohio.

“I thought that today would be the worst day,” Dr. Katie McHugh, a provider at the Indianapolis abortion clinic Women’s Med, told the AP on Thursday. “But I think the worst day was yesterday, knowing that the patients that we saw in the office yesterday were the last ones that we would see, and knowing how much it meant for all of us that were there — the staff, the physicians and the patients — that we were able to provide that care to the last moment.”

Dr. Alison Case — who since 2020 provided medication abortions at the South Bend abortion clinic Whole Woman’s Health — will continue her work as a family practice doctor in Indianapolis.

She said she worries for the labor and delivery patients she oversees at a hospital in the city.

“I think there’s going to be more people forced to carry their pregnancies to term, so I think we’ll see more deliveries,” she said. “But I think, important to note, we’re also going to see more of these complications.”

In Ohio, clinics were preparing for a high volume of patients coming in from surrounding states following the judge’s ruling — though they realize it could be short-lived.

“Well, I never expected to be a surge state,” said Iris Harvey, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, using the new lingo of the field. “For 14 days, we might be.”

Ohio clinics that had been prohibited from performing most abortions will resume those services beginning Friday.

HOW IS THIS AFFECTING PATIENTS?

The shifting legal landscape has required patients in affected states to regroup, sometimes repeatedly. Kellie Copeland, executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio, an abortion rights advocacy group, said some have been unable to terminate their pregnancies.

Harvey said Planned Parenthood has set up a central location for abortion requests and hired additional staff, oftentimes social workers, to help people navigate various states’ laws as they change.

McHugh said Women’s Med received “dozens” of calls Wednesday from patients who could not schedule an abortion that day due to Indiana’s 18-hour waiting period on the procedure.

“Every time it was a difficult conversation, because every time it was like breaking the news to someone that they couldn’t get their care,” McHugh said.

Lawyers were still reviewing whether patients traveling from Indiana to Ohio would be able to get anything but a surgical abortion. The two-pill regimen used in medication abortions would generally mean taking one pill in a permissive state and one in a restrictive state, the latter potentially breaking the law, providers said.

Anti-abortion groups continue to tout existing restrictions and the new ones being passed in the states in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling.

“Ohio is pro-life and this law was supported by the people,” said Margie Christie, president of the Right to Life Action Coalition of Ohio. “Women do not need abortion in Ohio. We have abundant resources for mothers and their children to thrive.”

WHEN WILL THE LANDSCAPE SHIFT AGAIN?

With Indiana’s ban taking effect, the nation has 13 states with current bans on abortion at any point in pregnancy and one more, Georgia, with a ban on abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected — usually around six weeks, often before women realize they’re pregnant.

Though it had not yet been signed by the governor, a ban approved by West Virginia lawmakers Wednesday had already prompted the state’s only abortion clinic to close, pushing potentially more patients to neighboring Ohio. Arizona’s ban is scheduled to kick in Sept. 24, with legal cases and legislative action expected to continue to change the status of abortion access of some states.

Then, on Nov. 8, abortion-related measures will be on ballots in at least five states. In California, Michigan and Vermont, voters will be asked to protect the right to abortion. In Kentucky, the question is whether to amend the state constitution to declare that it does not include the right to abortion. And Montana voters will decide on a measure to require medical care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion.

Said spent six years on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List before he was arrested in Justin in August 2020.

The death penalty is not an option in this case. If convicted of capital murder, Said would automatically be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Defendant Yaser Abdel Said took the stand as the only defense witness Monday in his trial for the purported ""honor killing"" of his daughters. The 65-year-old cab driver from Lewisville is accused of murdering his two teenage daughters in 2008.

The father said he loved his daughters and is not to blame for their killing.

Speaking through an interpreter in his native Arabic, Said testified someone else is responsible for the crime, but investigators never found that person because they only pursued him.

""If the FBI did their work, they would know, but they were looking for Yaser Said and they did not do what they have to do,"" he said.

Defense lawyers unsuccessfully tried to limit the scope of cross-examination. The judge warned Said that prosecutors would be allowed to raise any issue from the trial with him but he said he wanted to talk anyway.

The father told the courtroom that he only wanted to take his two daughters to dinner on New Year's Day 2008 but on the road in his taxi, he said he saw someone following them.

He said he assumed that he was the target and so he claimed he got out of the car at an Irving Transit Center where he assumed the girls would be safe.

""I told them the car is yours. You do whatever you want since you know how to drive. I left the car for them,"" he said.

Later, Said added he heard about an accident and learned that his girls had been murdered. He said he regrets leaving them alone and denied killing them.

A prosecutor picked at Said's story and asked why he was on the run for 12 years if he was not guilty despite seeing media reports that he was wanted.

""Because I believed behind this coverage there was a secret agenda. And I feel the media was against me in a certain direction, that I would not get a fair trial,"" Said said.

The defense rested after the defendant's testimony.

The judge said the jury would be given instructions and closing arguments would be delivered Tuesday morning.

Jurors were told to pack a bag. They will be sequestered in a hotel if deliberations continue for more than a day.

JURY SHOWN BULLET-RIDDLED CLOSING, FORENSIC PHOTOS ON DAY 4 of SAID TRIAL

Prosecutors continue trying to build their case against a father accused of murdering his teenage daughters. A detective and construction worker were among the witnesses called in the trial of Yaser Said this Friday afternoon. NBC 5’s Maria Guerrero reports.

On Friday, graphic crime scene evidence was shown to the jury, including bullet-riddled clothing worn by the girls on the night of the murders.

The cause of death for both victims was listed as multiple gunshot wounds and homicide as the manner of death.

Said refused to look up as two medical examiners who conducted the victims’ autopsies took the stand and described photographs of each victim’s examination displayed in the courtroom. Each girl, they said, had been shot multiple times.

Amina suffered two gunshot wounds, including a fatal wound to the chest. The medical examiner found 1,500 milliliters of blood in Amina’s right chest cavity, the equivalent of three water bottles.

Sarah suffered nine gunshot wounds, mostly to her abdomen, according to the medical examiner. Her chilling 911 call was played before the jury on Wednesday where she was heard saying her father shot her and that she was dying.

FBI AGENT RECALLS HUNTING 'MOST WANTED' MAN

FBI agent Daniel Gimenez, who led the federal government’s effort to track down Said, took the stand Friday afternoon.

Gimenez detailed the local and global search for Said who was on the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitive list before his 2020 arrest at a home in Justin.

“Upon the SWAT team’s notice and knock announced, the defendant came out and surrendered,” said Gimenez. “We took him into custody without incident.”

WAS IT AN HONOR KILLING?

Whether the girls were victims of an honor killing for allegedly bringing dishonor to their family has been widely speculated by loved ones and media since their murder in 2008.

On Friday, that phrase took center stage.

""I do not have first-hand knowledge of what an honor killing is. There's no such thing as an honor killing, you kill somebody there's no honor to it. It's a murder,"" Irving Police Detective Joe Henning said.

A film made about the murders, ""The Price of Honor,"" alleges the girls were killed by their father as an ""honor killing,"" a cultural practice where someone is killed after bringing shame on their family. The film furthers speculation the girls' father objected to his daughters living an ""American lifestyle.""

Dr. Brasheer Ahmed, with the Muslim Community Center in North Richland Hills, told NBC 5 in 2020, following Said's arrest, that murder was against Islamic principal.

""Under no way, this is honor killing. This is just killing. This is murder. And this is not acceptable,"" Ahmed said.

TEEN'S MOTHER TESTIFIES ON DAY 3 OF YASER SAID'S TRIAL

The capital murder trial of Yaser Abdel Said, a 65-year-old cab driver from Lewisville accused of murdering his two teenage daughters in a purported ""honor killing"" continued Thursday in Dallas with the girls' mother taking the stand.

On Thursday, the mother of Amina and Sarah Said took the stand. Patrica Owens, Yaser Said's ex-wife, testified before the jury Thursday morning and said why she fled her home with her daughters only to return days before they were killed.

Owens, who visibly had trouble on the stand and has been diagnosed with PTSD and is on medication, said she met Said when she was 14 and he was 29. She said she married him at the age of 15, with the permission of her parents after dating for three weeks and had three children with him over the next three years.

She said she and her two daughters returned to her husband because he was abusive and she was scared of getting hurt if they didn't.

She said she urged Amina to return home on the day of the murders even though the teen said she feared for her life. Owens said on the day her daughter returned Yaser appeared happy and he kissed her on the forehead and shed a tear.

When asked to identify her ex-husband in court, Owens raised her arm, pointed at Said and said, “That devil there.” She told jurors she and her husband had not spoken since the night their daughters were killed.

Prosecutors asked Owens if she had any idea what might have happened to her daughters when they left to eat with their father and she said, “Part of me did. Part of me didn’t"" before saying, ""I'm sorry.""

Owens said her ex-husband was abusive and controlling and would look over the girls' phone records and would call numbers to see if they belonged to a boy or a girl. Prosecutors said Said was angry the girls were dating out of their culture and that they had recently ran away to be with their boyfriends.

Prosecutors claim Said's daughters made an outcry that he'd sexually abused them and had touched them inappropriately.

Said's defense argued Owens' story had changed so much over the years that she was close to becoming a suspect herself and also claimed police were fixated on blaming a Muslim man for the killings instead of looking at other potential suspects. The defense is also expected to try to discredit Sarah's chilling 911 call, played before the jury on Wednesday, where she said her father shot her.

The girls' bodies were found in their father's taxi cab outside the Omni hotel in Irving, both of them had been shot multiple times. Said disappeared and had not been seen for 12 years until his arrest in Justin by the FBI in August 2020.

Said entered a not guilty plea Tuesday and faces an automatic life sentence if convicted.

911 CALL TAKES CENTER STAGE DURING DAY 2 OF YASER SAID TRIAL

Silence filled Dallas County District Court 7 Wednesday as prosecutors prepared to present the chilling 911 call made by a dying Sarah Said on New Year 2008.

“My dad shot me! I’m dying! I’m dying,” yelled a frantic woman identified as Sarah.

Yaser Said sat emotionless, holding a finger to his ear to listen to the disturbing audio.

The potential key piece of evidence was admitted on day two of testimony, despite objections by the defense who previously cautioned jurors their expert will later testify that the 17-year-old victim may have been ‘hallucinating’ after being shot nine times when she named her father as her shooter.

Jurors also saw the orange taxi cab where she and her 18-year-old sister, Amina, were found shot to death.

Hotel employee Nathan Watson testified about the moment a taxi cab driver reported seeing two injured people in the cab lane of the hotel.

“I could see a young lady who had her eyes fixed open and there was stuff coming out of her nose,” said Watson.

Police allege these were ‘honor killings’ committed by an abusive, controlling and possessive father who was angry his daughters dated outside their culture and had left home recently.

Said’s three public defenders argue this was a botched police investigation fixated on a Muslim man in a post-9/11 world full of Islamophobia.

Day two of testimony ended with a former crime scene investigator who wheeled in a cart full of evidence including the bullet-riddled cab seats, shell casings and projectiles found throughout the car and photographs showing a shell casing found on Amina’s shoulder.

Former Irving police officer Steven Hazard testified he believed the girls were not shot at the location they were found.

He also told evidence on Sarah’s body indicated she was shot at very close range.

OPENING STATEMENTS ON DAY 1 OF YASER SAID CAPITAL MURDER TRIAL

During opening statements Tuesday morning, prosecutor Lauren Black said Said was ""obsessed with possession and control.""

About a week before the sisters were killed, they and their mother fled their home in Lewisville to Oklahoma to get away from their dad, who worked as a taxi driver, Black said. The sisters had become ""very scared for their lives,"" and the decision to leave was made after Said ""put a gun to Amina's head and threatened to kill her,"" the prosecutor said.

But, Black said, in another act of ""control"" and ""manipulation"" by Said, he told them he had changed and convinced them to return home. The evening the sisters were shot, their father wanted to take just the two of them to a restaurant, she said.

He controlled what they did, who they talked to, who they could be friends with, if they and who they could date. And he controlled everything in his household Lauren Black, prosecutor

The girls' aunt, Connie Moggio, broke down on the stand as she identified autopsy photos of her nieces. She told jurors about a conversation she had with a frantic Amina the day of the murders. ""She didn't want to go back home, she would rather be dead than ever go back there,"" Moggio testified.

In a letter written to the judge overseeing the case, Said said he was not happy with his kids' ""dating activity"" but denied killing his daughters. Defense attorney Joseph Patton said in opening statements that the evidence would not support a conviction, that police were too quick to focus on Said, who was born in Egypt, and suggested that anti-Muslim sentiment played into that focus.

""It is wrong for the government to generalize an entire culture, criminalize an entire culture, to fit their narrative, and to fit their objective. The state wants to convict Yaser for being Muslim in 2008,"" said Patton.

His defense said no one will testify they saw Said at the crime scene, adding police should have investigated the girls' mother or Amina's boyfriend. ""They were the last people to see Amina and Sarah alive,"" he said.

Amina's boyfriend testified he and his father indeed saw Said and both girls in his cab shortly before the shooting and that they briefly followed them out of concern. ""Her look was in fear, she didn't look like she wanted to be there,"" said Amina's boyfriend Edgar Ruiz.

The girls, who were both students at Lewisville High School, were reportedly shot multiple times by their father. Their bodies were later discovered inside his cab, parked outside of an Omni hotel.

Before she died, Sarah was able to call 911 and told the operator, ""Help, my dad shot me! I'm dying, I'm dying!""

Black said Sarah Said was shot nine times and Amina Said was shot twice.

In moments of extreme trauma, like being shot multiple times, people can have hallucinations, Patton said.

Black said the sisters, both high school students in Lewisville, dreamed of becoming doctors, and that Yaser Said grew ""angrier"" as they grew up and became more educated and independent.

""When they had more independence, that was less control for him,"" Black said.

Sarah's boyfriend testified about why she kept their relationship a secret. ""Something would happen to me or something would happen to her,"" Erik Panameno told jurors.

Prosecutors presented an email Amina reportedly sent her Lewisville teacher days before her death, confiding that her father was arraigning her marriage so she and her sister were going to run away. ""He will kill us,"" Amina wrote.

More than 58 people are expected to be called to testify, including the girls' mother as well as local and federal investigators and experts on Muslim culture.

The judge is also allowing prosecutors to tell jurors about allegations that Said sexually abused his own daughters, who later recanted.

A film made about the murders, ""The Price of Honor,"" alleged the girls were killed by their father as an ""honor killing,"" a cultural practice where someone is killed after bringing shame on their family. The film furthers speculation the girls' father objected to his daughters living an ""American lifestyle.""

Yaser Said, who had been sought on a capital murder warrant since the slayings, was placed on the FBI's most-wanted list. In August 2020 Said was arrested in Justin and two relatives were arrested in Euless. The relatives were identified by the Dallas FBI as Said's brother Yassein and his son Islam.

Both men were charged with harboring a known fugitive and are now serving time in federal prison.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-rules-ghost-guns-are-firearms-bars-polymer80-selling-dc-resident-rcna42847,Judge rules 'ghost guns' are firearms and bars Polymer80 from selling them to D.C. residents,"Ghost gun kits and parts are in fact firearms, a court said in a landmark judgment, barring one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of the homemade and untraceable weapons from selling its do-it-yourself products to residents in Washington, D.C.

Polymer80, a Nevada-based ghost gun manufacturer and distributor, has to pay more than $4 million in penalties for making false claims about the legality of its products, a judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia ruled Wednesday.

Gun-safety advocates said the ruling was crucial to stem the flow of ghost guns, which are increasingly favored among criminals nationwide because the kits are bought without a background check and can be put together in under two hours.

It is significant even outside the U.S. capital, they said, amid a handful of other lawsuits against ghost gun companies and ahead of new federal regulations that go into effect soon.

“It’s a resounding victory for the people of the district, for gun safety and, frankly, for common sense,"" said David Pucino, the deputy chief counsel at the Giffords Law Center, a gun-safety group.

Pucino, who specializes in ghost guns, said Polymer80 is the ""worst actor in this space,"" slamming the company's ""utterly egregious"" practices.

Polymer80 did not respond Friday to a request for comment.

The company had argued its products are not firearms. But D.C. Superior Court Judge Ebony Scott said Polymer80's unfinished receivers, frames and ""Buy, Build, Shoot"" kits are, in fact, defined as such.

As a result, Scott ordered the company to permanently stop selling them to district residents and barred Polymer80 from saying the products are legal there.

Scott cited “Polymer80’s alarming belief” that the sale of its firearms is legal in the district as part of the reason the court granted the plaintiff’s request for a permanent injunction.

Polymer80 also has to ""prominently notify"" its website visitors that those products are illegal to sell and own in the district and relay that message to all of its past, present and future dealers and distributors.

More significantly, Pucino said, the judgment validates an upcoming Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) rule that will subject ghost guns to the same regulations as traditional firearms.

Beginning Aug. 24, those who sell ghost guns will have to be licensed. Background checks have to be conducted before sales, and manufacturers must ensure the parts have serial numbers.

“The court is already recognizing what the ATF is recognizing,” Pucino said.

Across the country, officials say ghost guns have been increasingly showing up at crime scenes. And when they do, they’re harder to trace to an individual buyer because they’re not currently marked with serial numbers.

The ATF said it received more than 45,000 reports of suspected ghost guns recovered by law enforcement from January 2016 to December 2021. Nearly 700 of them were recovered in homicide or attempted homicide investigations, officials said.

In 2021 alone, the White House said about 20,000 suspected ghost guns were reported to the federal government as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations. That’s 10 times as many as in 2016, the administration said.

In Washington, the Metropolitan Police Department recovered 439 ghost guns in 2021, a 146-fold increase from the three it recovered in 2017, officials said.

There's also been an uptick in ghost guns showing up in New York City, where police say they have seized 263 of them in connection with arrests in 2021, compared to 150 in 2020, and 48 in 2019.

So far this year, about 9% of all guns recovered by police have been ghost guns, while more are likely flooding the streets, according to a lawsuit the city filed in June against ghost gun sellers.

The attorney generals in New York state and California have filed lawsuits against ghost gun sellers, while officials in Baltimore and Los Angeles have specifically targeted Polymer80 in their suits.

Calling ghost guns a ""devastating menace,"" Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said Polymer80 accounts for 91% of all seized ghost guns in the city.

The D.C. court's decision, issued Wednesday, favors the arguments the petitioners have made in those suits, Pucino said.

“All of those cases are strong, but having authority from a court validating the theories in those cases is extremely encouraging,"" he said.

D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine sued Polymer80 in 2020, alleging that the company had violated consumer protection law by falsely claiming that its weapons are legal in the district and by selling illegal guns to D.C. consumers.

The $4 million fine puts pressure on Polymer80 and other companies and sends a message that their businesses may no longer be financially viable, Pucino and Racine said.

“This judgment,"" Racine said, ""is a major victory for D.C. residents and for public safety, and it will help slow the flow of deadly untraceable ghost guns into our community.""",Q3

As Tomkins notes, the city is making some efforts to address the affordable housing crisis. “The city has converted two former hotels into shelters that can house up to 130 people as encampments are cleared and has plans to add more than 1,000 more housing units in the next two years.” However, the slow pace of progress means many Austin residents still find themselves on the street, “shuffled from place to place” by police.

The ban on public sleeping comes after the same restriction was rescinded three years ago, but public outcry led to its reinstatement last year. “A political action committee called Save Austin Now gathered enough signatures to put a camping ban on the ballot, which Austin voters overwhelmingly approved by a 57% to 42% margin.” According to Tomkins, “The following month, Abbott also signed into law a statewide camping ban passed by the Legislature, with penalties for any city that failed to enforce it.”

Tomkins profiles Lt. Lawrence Davis, the police lieutenant tasked with leading the camping ban enforcement. Davis struggled with how to approach people in violation of the ban. “If we’re going to tell people to leave, then it just seemed reasonable that we should be able to tell people where to go,” said Davis, echoing the problem facing other cities. In 2017, Houston was forced to stop enforcing that city’s camping ban after a federal judge ruled that “enforcing the ordinance when people had nowhere else to go would violate their Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.” Since then, the city has redoubled its efforts to end chronic homelessness.

The article outlines Austin’s inadequate housing programs, pointing out that “most people living on the street or in shelters have already been assessed for housing and are on a waiting list that averages about eight months.” Plans are in the works to create housing for an additional 3,000 people by the end of 2024 using American Rescue Plan Act funding, among other sources.",Q3
https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/08/11/western-elites-blame-the-people-for-resisting-failed-green-policies/,Western Elites Blame the People for Resisting Failed Green Policies,"Europe is in a world of hurt when it comes to energy.

News outlet Die Welt reported last Sunday that the German government was preparing to deal with backlash from angry citizens who will need to deal with a massive energy crisis come winter.

According to the outlet, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told news broadcaster ARD in July that skyrocketing heating costs are a “powder keg for society.”

As the war in Ukraine continues to rage and failed green policies contribute to weak domestic energy production, the government has been forced to reckon with the fact that there will be shortages when things get cold.

Current proposals to save energy include keeping streetlights dark at night to requiring buildings keep lower temperatures. And, of course, begging citizens to use less electricity at home.

To aid in this endeavor, the government announced a new levy on gas that will likely cost the average German family of four 500 euros ($507) to 1,000 euros ($1,030) per year.

Germany isn’t the only country in Europe that’s feeling the heat with energy usage.

Spain announced earlier in August that it would regulate what the temperature for public and commercial buildings could be set at.

Amid a sweltering heat wave across the continent, the Spanish government forbid businesses from setting air conditioners below 81 degrees. That temperature control policy will extend into the frigid winter when businesses will be banned from heating their offices past 66 degrees.

But for as much as these policies are supposed to be a “we’re all in this together” sort of solution to the energy crisis, it’s obvious they will disproportionately impact the common man.

Does anyone really think that Europe’s elite will suffer from suffocating heat waves or bitterly cold nights? Of course not. They’ll be just fine.

It’s average citizens who will suffer when energy rationing happens, most among them the poorest whose homes might have poor insulation. But rather than address these genuine concerns from the citizenry, elites criticize them.

One need not look all the way to Europe. It’s happening in America, too.

Stories abound of politicians and celebrities who decry the hoi polloi for having the gall to fly in planes or drive cars getting caught doing something far worse for the environment.

Microsoft founder and climate alarmist Bill Gates routinely chastises Americans for their evil, Mother Earth-killing ways while simultaneously taking private planes to an endless number of climate conferences.

America’s illustrious Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who infamously told Americans worried about ballooning gas prices to just go out and buy an electric car and abandoned his post for so-called paternity leave during the worst supply chain crisis the U.S. has seen in decades, is also shockingly hypocritical.

In March 2021, Buttigieg claimed that a mileage tax, where Americans would be charged based on how far they drove, showed “a lot of promise.”

“If we believe in that so-called user-pays principle, the idea that part of how we pay for roads is you pay based on how much you drive,” Buttigieg said. “The gas tax used to be the obvious way to do it; it’s not anymore. A so-called vehicle miles traveled tax or a mileage tax, whatever you want to call it, could be the way to do it.”

Buttigieg, of course, doesn’t use those icky cars to go anywhere. He bikes!

As Heritage Foundation experts have demonstrated, a mileage tax would result in more taxes for the average American family, not the ultra-wealthy.

Heritage Foundation policy analyst David Ditch argues that “even if the gas tax were to be eventually phased out, supporters of a mileage tax are clear that the main goal of the tax is to bring in more revenue than the gas tax currently provides.”

“Either way, that spells a tax increase, and one that will disproportionately hit blue-collar workers who can’t telecommute,” Ditch continued.

The Daily Signal is the media arm of The Heritage Foundation.

At the end of the day, Buttigieg and the German Bundestag are doing the same thing: blaming their citizens for failed green policies that hurt more than they help.

The people can’t roll over and accept these assaults on their standard of living from bureaucrats and elites who don’t even practice what they preach.

Dutch farmers in the Netherlands are protesting those failed green policies in their country, and they should serve as a model for those in the West sick of being blamed by elites for not radically upending their lives for the climate.

If the people don’t push back, we’ll be left out in the cold.

https://www.theaquarian.com/2023/08/11/reality-check-ohio-calling/,Reality Check: OHIO CALLING,"Another Fascist Republican defeat to democracy & the call of women’s reproductive rights nationwide.

We’re not going to stop until Republicanism is dead. Period. We’re going to use the tool of women’s reproductive rights to do it, because, so far, the not-so-silent majority is on an unprecedented winning streak to send the fascists a message nationwide.

On August 8, a record turnout of highly motivated voters rejected a scam by a super-majority of Republicans in Ohio to make it harder for the will of the people to change their state constitution. This cheap and losing tactic was lashed together haphazardly for the fascists to stop the codifying of women’s reproductive rights that they robbed from them. And so, Ohio joins Kansas, Michigan, Kentucky, Vermont, California, and a growing number of states to stamp out the illegal virus heaped upon the U.S. after the ignominiously unconstitutional striking down of Roe v. Wade by a corrupt Supreme Court last summer. And it is not going to stop.

It was a nice try by the fascists to whip up a special election referendum to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution from a majority to 60%. After all, 57% of its citizenry want legal and safe access to abortion and that issue is on the ballot this November. This is thanks to a petition that doubled the number (700K) needed to get it there. Republicans had to stop it, because these hypocrites who and claim that the striking down of Roe v Wade lets states decide…. but they don’t want states to decide, because when they do their anti-woman policies go bye-bye. So, they play games, and they lost this game, and will keep losing these games until they either give up, come to the table on a national referendum to return women the rights they’ve had for half a century, or die on that hill.

I would take either, but prefer both.

The assumption by the Republicans who cooked up the idea of taking the voter’s voice from them was that not enough of them would notice – low turnout in early summer. And so, they changed the rules (even though this same body of “legislators” banned special August elections just last year) and hoped to crush the democratic process.

Although, democracy went all democracy on them.

Democrats, independents, and a surprisingly considerable number of Republicans from districts Donald Trump won by 10 to 15 points voted to strike down this “Issue 1” scam, in some cases by 40 points. The ballot-box slaughter was a vehement rebuke of fascist tactics. In the fall they will lose again.

By the way, as a matter of record and sweet revenge, the final tally was 57% voting “no” on Issue 1, the exact polling number that want legal abortion codified into their constitution.

If August 8 and red-state Ohio standing up for women’s reproductive rights is any indication, the momentum and furor over the disastrous Supreme Court Dobbs decision has not eased. If anything, it has gained fire. Just a few months ago Wisconsin, a severe 50/50 battleground state, elected a liberal judge, flipping the court for the first time in 15 years to stop the draconian anti-women laws sanctioned by state Republicans. This all but guarantees a lawsuit against their unconstitutional shenanigans will be successful and as a bonus will spark a long-overdue redistricting to disallow fascist Republican gerrymandering, which is one of the severest in the nation.

You see, Republicans are in the minority on almost every issue; gun violence, climate change, “Wokism,” LGBTQ+ rights, and abortion, among many others, and have only been competitive because of heavy gerrymandering. They have no national voice – having lost the raw majority vote in every presidential election except one (2004) – for the past 35 years, and with Mr. Soon-to-be- Convicted at the top of their ballot, this will stumble closer to half a century. They must stop you from voting, otherwise they don’t exist. Most Republicans are in their seventies and eighties and the new flock of teen-to-30 voters (Gen Z) are progressive, politically aware, and apparently voting in record numbers. The University of Ohio students had a 95% attendance rate in this August 8 vote.

If I was stupid enough to cling to the Republican party at this juncture, I’d cheat, too, but this latest attempt to do so was sent packing in a red state by a large margin in the middle of summer.

This November they will finish the job and notch another victory for women’s rights and put fascism on notice once again.",Q3

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The refusal of Ukraine and Western powers to recognise Moscow's control of Crimea poses a ""systemic threat"" for Russia and any outside attack on the region will prompt a ""Judgment Day"" response, former president Dmitry Medvedev said on Sunday 17 July 2022.

Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 after a pro-Moscow president in Kyiv was toppled amid mass street protests. Moscow then also backed pro-Russian armed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

In the event of an attack on Crimea, Medvedev was quoted by TASS news agency as saying, ""Judgment Day will come very fast and hard. It will be very difficult to hide.""

Medvedev did not elaborate but has previously warned the United States of the dangers of attempting to punish a nuclear power such as Russia over its actions in Ukraine, saying this could endanger humanity.

His comments were aired a day after a Ukrainian official suggested that Crimea, which most of the world still recognises as part of Ukraine, could be a target for United States (US)-made HIMARS missiles, recently deployed by Kyiv as it battles Russian forces.

Earlier on Sunday, Interfax news agency quoted Medvedev as telling World War Two veterans: ""If any other state, be it Ukraine or NATO countries, believes that Crimea is not Russian, then this is a systemic threat for us.""

""This is a direct and an explicit threat, especially given what had happened to Crimea. Crimea returned to Russia,"" said Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council.

Vadym Skibitskyi, an official at Ukrainian military intelligence, was asked on Saturday in a televised interview if HIMARS could be used on targets in Crimea.

He said Russia had carried out strikes on Ukrainian territory from Crimea and the Black Sea and so these were also justified targets.

Crimea is of particular strategic importance to Russia as it includes the headquarters of its Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol.",Q3

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. evolved significantly on the issue of reparations during his short lifetime. Toward the start of his career, he was a moralist in his thinking, rather than the radical economic thinker he later became. In 2018, I befriended Dr. King’s former barber, Nelson Malden, now in his late 80s, and wrote a book with him titled “The Colored Waiting Room” about Nelson’s life and the American civil rights movement. Nelson relayed an interesting anecdote to me regarding a debate Dr. King had inside his barbershop with a sociology professor.

Nelson told me that King said to the professor, “Morality is one of the strongest forces in the American family.” The professor disagreed with King and said, “I beg your pardon, sir, but I believe that economics is the strongest force in the American family.” The professor went on to say, “When the Europeans came to this country, one of the first things they did was build the top universities in the New England area to educate themselves. When they got oranges in Florida, sugar cane in Louisiana, oil in Texas, grapes in California and tobacco in Virginia, they built Wall Street to control the capital, and then they built West Point to defend it.” He ended by saying, “That is the United States of America.”

Nelson reminded me that just before King was murdered, he began to speak out more publicly about economic injustice and inequality. He famously wrote: “No amount of gold could provide an adequate compensation for the exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down through the centuries. Not all the wealth of this affluent society could meet the bill. Yet a price can be placed on unpaid wages.”

The more I think about it, particularly in today’s post Breonna Taylor and post George Floyd worlds, the more I come to the same conclusion. Reparations — that is to say, compensation today for historic injustice — would be a major step forward in correcting these enormous infringements on civil liberties.

Why aren’t more people educating themselves on the idea of reparations to the African American descendants of slaves? We know the U.S. can afford it, since they spend trillions of dollars every few years to offer tax breaks and bailouts to billionaires and corporations. This country benefited significantly from the American slave trade. Those who enslaved people grew rich from free labor. They paid taxes, and those tax dollars were used to fund the construction of roads, bridges, towns and more. Building that infrastructure helped to grow and establish this place we call America. Our government is a co-conspirator in this matter, not just some passive onlooker who watched from the sideline.

And the old racist trope that tells us that some people who receive reparation payments would just “blow” the money on meaningless things has been shot to pieces. Economists have informed us that stimulus payments to Americans during the pandemic would “stimulate” the economy, and their advice won over members of both houses of Congress. So, the argument that reparation recipients would mismanage their money is not a valid argument.

Economic disparities in the Black community are a real problem, and reparation payments could help level the playing field, even bridge the gap in disparities in health, education, and access to capital for entrepreneurs and homeownership. Governments have made reparations payments before to specific groups who suffered enormous injustices. This is not new.

But reparations for me means more than just a check in my hand.

Reparations for me means more than just a down payment on my children’s education. Reparations for me means more than just a down payment on a home. Reparations for me means more than just an acknowledgment by America that atrocities were committed for hundreds of years on the same soil where we live today.

Reparations means that the life of my great-great grandmother, Hana Washington, who was sexually assaulted in 1883 in Mississippi by a white man, is acknowledged. Reparations for me means that the life of my great grandmother, Mary Washington, who was born into this world as a misbegotten child after a crime was committed against her 20-year-old mother, is acknowledged.

If history matters to white southerners who cherish their confederate flags and statues of treasonous generals who lost the Civil War, then the history of the injustices committed against Black people over centuries should matter just as much to the rest of America.

Reparations would show that it does.

Pensacola plans to allow sitting e-scooters only.,"After August, only seated electric scooters will be available to rent in Pensacola as the council passed another extension for the city's pilot program with the goal of making it permanent in October.

The Pensacola City Council voted 6-0 Thursday night to extend the e-scooter program to Oct. 31 for seated e-scooters only. The current pilot program for e-scooters is set to expire on Aug. 31.

The two-month extension will allow city staff to negotiate permanent contracts with the two scooter companies operating under the city's pilot program, Veo and Bird.

On Monday, Deputy City Administrator David Forte told the City Council that city staff was recommending only continuing the program with seated scooters.

Because Bird's scooters were stand-up scooters, it looked like the end of that company's operations in Pensacola; however, Bruno Lopes with Bird told the City Council Thursday night the company has a seated scooter option.

""We do have a way to convert one of our vehicles into a seated scooter,"" Lopes said. ""We simply don't deploy it very often, and most cities aren't interested in it. But we do have an option for it.""

Bye-bye Bird, hello Veo:Pensacola looks to make seated e-scooters permanent in downtown

Summer extension:Pensacola's e-scooters pilot program extended until the end of August

Here to stay:Love 'em or hate 'em, e-scooters could be sticking around downtown Pensacola a bit longer

Lopes said the company employs eight people in Pensacola and those people would be out of a job if the company is forced to close operations.

Under the resolution passed Thursday night, Bird has until Aug. 31 to convert their scooters to seated scooters, or it must stop operating. The company would still be eligible to negotiate a new contract for seated scooters by Oct. 31.

Lopes also claimed his company was not informed of the decision until the city sent out a letter indicating that was the direction the city was going. Forte said he spoke with Lopes directly to inform him about the change.

""At that time, Bird could have very well said, 'We have a seated scooter option, we'd be glad to deploy that if you want,'"" Forte said. ""We would have entertained it at that time. I'm surprised that tonight's the night that they want to offer that as an option.""

Councilwoman Teniadé Broughton pointed out that her car was damaged when a homeless man picked up a Bird scooter and hit her car with it, and despite that, she still thought the company deserved a fair chance to be able to compete if they could offer a seated scooter.

""They've invested in the city,"" Broughton said. ""They've hired folks, they've contributed a lot (to the city).""

Councilwoman Sherri Myers said she remained opposed to the e-scooter program because they block the sidewalks and create violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

""The city will be sued if you continue to put these devices on sidewalks,"" Myers said. ""And that's where they're going to end up. The city's liable for it under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and I would assume the Florida Constitution, because people with physical disabilities are a protected class.""

Myers then grabbed her things and left the meeting without telling the council she was leaving, which violated the council's meeting policy.

Under the proposal, city officials will have until the end of October to bring back new contracts with the companies.

As part of a permanent scooter program, the company will require users to end their rides at designated parking zones, move the cutoff time for rides from midnight to 11 p.m., make the permit fee an annual fee for the provider, charge a city fee for each ride, and implement a system where riders will be fined by the company for improperly parking the scooters.

The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) on Friday, Aug. 26, released Attorney General Mark Vargo’s decision, clearing from criminal charges an officer of the Sioux Falls Police Department and a detective of the Minnehaha County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) in the Aug. 9 shooting death of 21-year-old Jacob Michael James.

At approximately 5:30 p.m. on Aug. 9, authorities with the Sioux Falls Area Drug Task Force — consisting of law enforcement from various local and state entities — initiated a traffic stop on a Pontiac Bonneville near the intersection of West 12th Street and South Williams Avenue, in west-central Sioux Falls, after allegedly witnessing the vehicle engage in drug activity.

The vehicle pulled into a Burger King parking lot, and three of the four occupants quickly exited the vehicle, according to Sioux Falls Police Chief Jon Thum.

According to DCI’s report, James produced a firearm from his waistband and fired three shots at authorities. A detective with the MCSO, referred to in the report as “Detective,” and an officer with the Sioux Falls Police Department, referred to in the report as “Investigator,” returned fire on James.

“Jacob Michael James continued to shoot at them,” the report reads. “Jacob Michael James was shot multiple times by the Detective and Investigator and later died as a result of those injuries.”

Ballistics testing conducted on Detective and Investigator’s firearms at the South Dakota Forensic Lab in Pierre revealed Detective fired seven shots while Investigator fired 14. An autopsy on James determined he was struck by four of the 21 bullets fired by law enforcement — with one bullet each striking his right elbow, left side of his abdomen, right thigh and right side of his chest.

Toxicology reports on Detective and Investigator found no alcohol or illegal drugs in their system, while a screening on James tested positive for alcohol in his blood and norfentanyl, fentanyl, fluorofentanyl and methamphetamine in his urine.

The three other suspects who fled, including one who fled in the Pontiac Bonneville, were later apprehended by authorities.

A high-risk, rush-hour shooting at a popular fast food stop

The shooting took place just one block off one of the city’s busiest intersections as many of the metropolitan area’s 280,000-plus residents were heading home from the standard work day.

The DCI’s report indicated that a review of all videos — including some taken by witnesses — showed “significant bystander traffic” throughout the duration of the shooting. While no other bystanders were injured in the shooting, investigators processing the scene discovered damages, referred to as “defects,” to multiple pieces of private property as a result of the shooting.

“There were several defects on the southwest corner of the Burger King building. There were two (2) apparent bullet defects in an unoccupied bystander vehicle parked near the southwest corner of the building,” the report reads. “There were two bullet projectiles recovered in a nearby business as well, to the east of Burger King.”

Two bullet holes were also discovered in the driver’s door of an unmarked MCSO vehicle in the lot.

In an Aug. 10 press conference, Thum noted that while the timing and location of the shooting weren’t ideal, law enforcement officers are trained to handle dangerous situations in any environment.

“[A high-traffic area] is a very challenging situation. We don't always choose the time, place or manner in which one of these happens. When people choose this action in this environment, it creates a very high consequence and very, very dangerous situation,” Thum said. “Officers are always prepared. I think sometimes they’re looked at as hyper-vigilant or over-prepared, but this is why.”

Family of James dispute DCI’s narrative

The DCI issued the shooting report just hours ahead of a planned gathering outside Burger King, where roughly 50 people planned to gather in memoriam.

“We’re left with a lot of questions, there’s no answers given to us,” Jessica Williams, a cousin to James, said at the gathering.

With many holding signs with reading “#JusticeForJacob,” Williams claimed that James was lying on the ground when officers continued to fire at him.

The DCI report does note that video taken by an uninvolved bystander did show James sitting on the ground, and that he appeared to throw something from his right hand. His firearm was later located by investigators “near” where he had been sitting, though a specific distance was not provided.

Despite doubts cast by those attending the gathering, a comprehensive review of all video gathered by authorities, interviews with Detective and Investigator and a review of the scene, the Office of the Attorney General said the two task force members were placed into a “tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving situation.”

Citing a “clear and present danger” to law enforcement officers as well as bystanders and their property, the shooting was deemed justified.

The Aug. 9 shooting marked the ninth officer-involved shooting in South Dakota this year. Of those shootings, six have been deemed justified, while three investigations remain ongoing.

So, keep your pistols and shotguns to hunt pheasants, but outlaw automatic war weapons that can kill people — and that increasingly are killing kids.

The Los Angeles Police Department explained in June how “bullets fired from an AR-15 are powerful enough to pierce soft body armor,” as RawStory reported . “Then, footage was shown from a ballistic lab where bullets were fired into a gelatin substance meant to mimic human flesh. When a handgun was fired at the substance, it created a single cavity through the substance and the bullet exited from the other side. A bullet fired from an assault rifle broke apart inside the substance and the damage was much more explosive. ‘It basically goes into the body and creates an explosion inside the body,’ Wayne University ballistics expert Cynthia Bir said.""

Digging through history like Blow did, I came across something similar which he did not mention: horrific scenes from the Nazi concentration camps and the Holocaust. We have images of what happened there, but right after the war little of it filtered out. Sure, German dictator Adolf Hitler was an SOB, but no one knew the extent of his inhumanity. One person did, and that was Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.

The saga started after Eisenhower went through the Ohrdruf concentration camp in Thuringia, Germany, in April 1945. He had to let the world know. America was suffering from combat fatigue, and newspaper headlines alone would not roust that much attention.

In my research, I came across Eisenhower’s comments to Army Chief of Staff George Marshall: “The most interesting — although horrible — sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp. … The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp, I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. … In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.”

After visiting the camp, Eisenhower cabled Marshall declaring that everything that appeared in the press so far about the sites was an “understatement.” We seem to have the same attitude in understating the dangers with having weapons of war.

On April 19, 1945, Eisenhower again cabled Marshall with a request to bring members of Congress and journalists to the newly liberated camps so that they could bring the horrible truth about German Nazi atrocities to the American public. Then Ike made German citizens walk through the camps to see Nazi barbarity with their own eyes. Documentaries were made of this, which eventually led to the Nuremberg war-crime trials.

America was suffering through mass-murder headline fatigue like we are now. Instead of yet another headline, we need to present the idea that the best way to prevent gun violence from weapons of war is by showing the disturbing images of the bloody carnage resulting from the use of these weapons. Politicians would think twice about parading around with an AR-15 for a photo op.

Show what firing the AR-15 can do to a small child’s body. Gruesome pictures are worth a thousand words.

Pictures of the Nazi carnage changed the narrative about the Nazis. We need to see what the weapons of war do to children and innocents — and then try to say that this somehow protects our democracy.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has taken centre stage at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday (20 September), with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denouncing Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine in February, for which there was “no justification whatsoever,” because „this is imperialism, plain and simple.” The ongoing General Assembly is the UN’s first full, in-person leader’s summit since the COVID-19 pandemic and comes as the war in Ukraine approaches its seventh month. And while Lithuania urged the establishment of a war crimes tribunal to punish Moscow’s atrocities, French President Emmanuel Macron appealed particularly to countries, including many in Africa, that have chosen to stay neutral to “consider that the day when something similar, with a more powerful neighbor, happens to you, there’ll be silence from the region, from the world?”

But some countries from Africa and the Middle East expressed unease at having to choose sides. “I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough of the burden of history; that it does not want to be the breeding ground of a new Cold War, but rather a pole of stability and opportunity open to all its partners, on a mutually beneficial basis,” said Macky Sall, the president of Senegal and the current chairman of the African Union. Also Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani echoed the call for peace when he said that “we are fully aware of the complexities of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and its international dimension, nevertheless, we call for a ceasefire and the immediate pursuit of a peaceful solution to the conflict.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that Turkey will continue its efforts to end the war with an agreement that is “based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity and independence”.

Meanwhile, on the sidelines of a UN meeting, a donor conference has raised a record $14.25bn for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in crucial new funding, after decades of progress against the diseases was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. United States President Joe Biden, who hosted the conference in New York City, said the funding — the highest amount ever pledged for a multilateral health organization — is crucial to combating the diseases. “This is an investment that will save another 20 million lives, reduce mortality from these diseases by another 64 percent in the next four years,” said Biden. The United Kingdom and Italy have said they will announce their commitments at a later date.",Q3
https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-health-legislature-madison-19dc7ab0c5f6e14b820916713d5d51df,Michels: Would sign abortion ban with rape/incest exceptions,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Republican Tim Michels said Friday that he would sign an abortion ban with exceptions for rape and incest if it came to his desk as governor, a shift from his earlier statement that Wisconsin’s 1849 ban — with an exception only for the life of the mother — was “an exact mirror” of his position.

Conservative radio host Dan O’Donnell asked Michels whether he would sign a bill passed by the Legislature with exceptions for rape and incest.

“I am pro-life, but I also understand that this is a representative democracy and if the people, in this case the Legislature, brought a bill before me, I would sign it,” Michels responded.

Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, locked in a close race with Michels in the key swing state, supports abortion rights. Evers has backed a lawsuit by Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, that argues the state’s 1849 ban is superseded by another law passed in 1985 that would allow for abortions before the point of viability.

For months, Michels has campaigned on statements that he wouldn’t support exceptions to the state’s abortion ban. At a Dane County GOP event earlier this month, Michels said he would not soften his stance on abortion, despite receiving calls asking him to support rape and incest exceptions.

“I’m winning because people see a strong leader, a man of conviction, a man who doesn’t waffle, a man who doesn’t flip-flop. I’m gonna stick with what I know is right,” he said on Sept. 6.

Michels’ campaign disputed that he was changing his position, saying he had simply answered a question about how he would handle a specific piece of legislation.

Polls have repeatedly shown that a majority of people in Wisconsin support abortion rights, and Wisconsin Democrats have made their backing of abortion rights central to campaigns this midterm.

A spokeswoman for Evers’ campaign said she doubts that Michels’ views have changed.

“Tim Michels has told us what he believes time and again, even promising earlier this month that he would not soften his dangerous views on abortion. We know he was telling us the truth over the past two decades as he consistently opposed these exceptions,” Evers spokesperson Kayla Anderson said.",Q3
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kansas-abortion-vote-value-them-both-constitutional-right-to-an-abortion-2022-08-02/,Kansas voters to weigh in directly on abortion rights,"Kansas voters on Tuesday will be the first in the nation to have their say on whether abortion should remain constitutionally protected in the state after landmark abortion ruling Roe v. Wade was overturned. And with the future of abortion rights in the state on the ballot, Kansas is seeing a surge in early voting ahead of the primary.

Since the Supreme Court rolled back the nearly 50-year-old decision in June, lawmakers in more than a dozen predominantly Republican-controlled states have already moved to ban or further restrict abortion access – and further efforts are expected. The court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization leaves it up to states to decide whether abortion remains legal.

In Kansas, the right to an abortion remains protected – at least for now.

In 2019, the state Supreme Court ruled personal autonomy is protected in the state constitution's bill of rights and applied strict scrutiny to regulating abortion. An amendment would need to be passed to remove that constitutional right.

The ""Value Them Both"" Amendment will appear on the ballot for the primary on Aug. 2. A ""yes"" vote for the amendment would affirm there is no constitutional right to an abortion in Kansas and allow the Republican-controlled state legislature to pass new laws further restricting or even banning abortion access. A ""no"" vote against the amendment upholds the protected right to an abortion in the state.

The amendment was proposed by the state legislature and put on the ballot in January 2021 with two-thirds of the vote in both chambers. A previous effort to get an abortion amendment on the ballot failed in February 2020 after several Republicans joined Democrats to block it in the Kansas House.

""When you read the language of the amendment, it's so clear that this is not a ban on abortion. This just returns the power to the people instead of removing us from the discussion entirely,"" said Danielle Underwood, spokesperson for the Value Them Both Coalition, which includes anti-abortion rights groups Kansans for Life, Kansas Catholic Conference and Kansas Family Voice.

They have shied away from publicly saying exactly what limitations on abortion they would like to see passed in the Kansas legislature should the amendment pass. But legal experts say the amendment paves the way for banning abortion in the state.

""What is misleading is people saying 'well, it just will allow debate' and suggesting there may be some reasonable discussion about this,"" said University of Kansas law professor Stephen McAllister, who clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas. ""It really is a referendum on whether we're going to let the legislature ban abortion or not.""

McAllister said if the amendment passes, he expects the legislature to propose bans starting the first or second day of the next legislative session in January. A ban with very limited exemptions was already introduced in March this year.

""Under the language of the amendment, it would be possible to adopt a total ban on abortion from the point of conception until birth with no exceptions for rape, incest, for the life and health of the mother,"" said University of Kansas constitutional law professor Richard Levy.

While abortion is currently protected in Kansas, there are multiple regulations on the books, some of which have gone unchallenged. Abortion is strictly limited after 22 weeks, the exception being when the woman is in serious physical jeopardy. Patients seeking an abortion are also required to receive an ultrasound and counseling and wait 24 hours. The use of telemedicine to administer abortion is prohibited. Patients under 18 require parental consent.

According to a report by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, nearly 70% of abortions performed in Kansas in 2021 occurred before nine weeks. Just over 20% occurred between 9 and 12 weeks. Only 3.8% occurred between 17 and 21 weeks.

""The fact is, the 'no' vote in Kansas is a middle-of-the-road vote. It is a moderate position. It is basically leaving all the regulations that are on the books in place,"" said Ashely All, spokesperson for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the main coalition opposing the amendment.

Organizations are spending millions on advertising in the state for and against the amendment. According to tracking by AdImpact, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom is spending nearly $6.5 million on advertisements against the amendment; Value Them Both is spending nearly $4.5 million on ads in support of the amendment. Other anti-abortion rights groups have also spent nearly $2 million combined on ads in the state.

Putting the amendment on the primary ballot rather than the general election ballot in November has fueled concerns among those who support abortion rights and oppose the amendment. More Republican voters are expected to turn out in August because Republicans have more contested primary elections. In 2020, turnout for the primary was less than half of what it was for the general election in the state.

As of Monday morning, more than 271,000 voters had cast ballots in the Kansas primary, a significant increase in early voting from the 2018 midterm primary, in which just under 90,000 ballots had been cast by this time.

Of those who voted in the 2022 primary so far, more than 198,000 were early in-person and 73,427 mailed ballots had been returned of the more than 120,000 mailed out. Republicans had a slight lead in voting overall with more than 122,000 ballots cast to Democrats, who had more than 106,000 ballots cast. More than 40,000 unaffiliated Kansans had also voted early.

Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and her likely GOP opponent are on opposite sides of the issue. Kelly has said she believes reproductive decisions should be between a woman and her doctor. In an email to CBS News, her campaign spokesperson Madison Andrus said the governor will ""continue to oppose all regressive legislation that interferes with individual freedoms or threatens the strides we've made in recent years making Kansas a constructive place to do business. That includes opposing efforts to change the state constitution this August.""

When Roe was overturned, Republican Kansas Attorney General and Republican governor candidate Derek Schmidt said in a statement he prefers a future with ""less abortion, not more"" and would vote for the amendment. He did not specify what legislation he would like to see should the amendment pass.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Kansas also had seen some uptick in voter registrations. According to vote.org, the state had a 963% increase in individuals starting the voter registration process through the organization's website from the two weeks prior to the court's June 24 decision. But it's unclear if those registering were for or against the amendment.

If the amendment passes, Kansas would join four other states that have constitutional amendments stating the state's constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. Those states, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Virginia, have all moved to ban or further restrict abortion following the Supreme Court overturned Roe.",Q3

The plant, designed by Kairos Power, will produce large quantities of high-purity fluoride salt coolant to be used in high-temperature molten salt reactors, a clean, affordable and safe nuclear energy solution with the potential to transform the global energy landscape,” the companies said.

Kairos Power’s fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (KP-FHR) technology is cooled by a mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride salts known as “Flibe” which is chemically stable and operates at low pressure. This molten salt coolant will be used in Kairos Power’s Engineering Test Unit (ETU), and the Hermes demonstration reactor, as well as future commercial KP-FHR reactors.

Materion is a supplier of beryllium fluoride for MSPP and contributes requisite expertise staffing and operating the plant. The decision to locate MSPP at Materion’s Elmore facility reinforces a long-term, strategic commitment by both companies to demonstrate leadership in molten salt production.

By confirming the chemical process to produce Flibe at industrial scale, MSPP will help ensure the success of Kairos Power’s iterative hardware demonstrations, reducing risk in a critical path work stream for the commercialization of KP-FHR technology while delivering cost certainty.

“With MSPP we have scaled up a chemical process developed in Kairos Power’s Salt Lab to produce Flibe in large quantities with specifications that demonstrate our ability to deliver for ETU,” said Kairos Power Senior Director Alan Kruizenga. “We’ve established a plant and a working team that will scale as needed in the future,” he said.

Keith Smith, Vice President of Nuclear, Science & Government Affairs, Materion Corporation said the plant design and process has been in development for more than a year. “This is the largest Flibe production facility ever built and has the capacity to generate commercial quantities of the material,” he noted.",Q3
https://richmondbizsense.com/2022/08/16/nonprofit-turns-to-shockoe-bottom-for-new-headquarters/,Nonprofit turns to Shockoe Bottom for new headquarters,"A nonprofit working to reduce recidivism rates in Virginia has relocated to Shockoe Bottom.

Nolef Turns recently moved from the Westwood area in Henrico County to 211 N. 18th St.

At its core, the organization functions to make life more manageable for those released from incarceration. The group, led by Executive Director Sheba Williams, tackles an array of issues faced by previously incarcerated people including child support, health care, housing and employment.

“We want them to be able to sit down with us and tell us what their goals are,” Williams said.

The organization works with 400 individuals annually, though the pandemic has increased this number considerably in recent years, reaching nearly 3,000 in COVID’s first year.

To accomplish its mission, Nolef Turns works with a variety of organizations, including the Community Bail Fund, Daily Planet, ACLU, and the Reentry Council, as well as housing groups.

In searching for a new home base, Williams chose the Shockoe Bottom space due to its central Richmond location and size.

“Access is really important, especially for people who do not have driver’s licenses,” Williams said. “People who have been incarcerated for a very long time do not drive.”

The 1,600-square-foot office will be the new base of operations for the five-person staff and provide ample room for the nonprofit’s training sessions.

Those who seek Nolef Turns’ services hear about the organization through word of mouth or are informed by the organization’s partners. The nonprofit also works with the Department of Corrections to speak with inmates directly, though this practice took a two-year pause due to COVID.

The organization offers training to improve employment prospects, made possible through partners the organization involves.

This upcoming August, for example, Nolef Turns will be collaborating with the Jackson Ward Collective to present entrepreneurship classes.

Although the Department of Corrections also provides training to inmates, Williams said that its effect can be limited, as state policies can bar convicts from getting professional licenses. Meanwhile, Williams, a barber by trade, helps individuals get licensed in the hair industry.

Nolef Turns also helps attain housing for those with convictions, as many are often rejected given their past.

Williams has seen this personally, as she said many of her family members have been previously imprisoned. “My mom only did six months,” she said. “She was still being denied housing for a conviction that was 32 years old.”

The issue became an even larger priority during the pandemic, when many faced the threat of eviction.

“We did some rent relief before the national program came in,” Williams said. “We knew that if people who had records … added (an eviction to their record), they probably would never be eligible for housing again.”

The organization worked to place people into temporary housing, including the use of motels, partially to limit the virus’ spread between them.

The group has only recently begun the pursuit of more grants, with most of its revenue coming from smaller donations. Williams said that the nonprofit experienced a surge in such revenue during 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests. It received a $90,000 grant from the city to provide 30 people transitioning out of incarceration with housing for two months.

The organization has plenty of work it hopes to achieve. Virginia has an incarcerated population of 20,000, with 60,000 on probation, according to Williams.

Williams’ efforts began in late 2016, stimulated by her inability to escape the repercussions caused by a wrongful conviction that made it difficult to land a job.

The frustration turned into activism in 2016, when the state’s Supreme Court overturned Gov. McAuliffe’s order to restore the voting rights of 206,000 convicted citizens, claiming that he did not have the power to do so with one sweeping law. Instead he promised to restore each person’s rights individually, something Williams contributed to.

“We went and knocked on doors and found as many people as we could and got their rights reinstated,” she said.

The nonprofit was represented in its Shockoe Bottom lease by Joyner Commercial’s Robert Brown, while Commonwealth Commercial repped the landlord.

Nolef Turns vacated its previous office at 2317 Westwood Ave. after the property was purchased by the Cava Cos. in 2021 and it was given notice to vacate.",Q3

An American tourist in Italy learned an expensive lesson this month: Be careful where you choose to sit to eat your gelato… though the fact that it was after midnight and he was also drinking a beer probably didn't help.

The 55-year-old tourist was issued a €450 fine (about $455 at the current exchange rate) for sitting on the steps of the Fontana dei Catecumeni in Rome on September 3, according to The Guardian. During the day, the fountain is a popular tourist attraction, but at some point in the evening, it had reportedly been cordoned off to prevent anyone from sitting in the area; however, the tape had apparently been removed, leaving the clueless American wondering why the police were citing him for breaking what are known as the city's ""urban decorum"" rules.

""I didn't know the rules, I didn't know I couldn't sit down. I didn't understand what you were saying to me,"" the tourist stated, according to The Drinks Business. Even in Italy, ignorance is not an excuse for breaking the law, but the man may have been his own worst enemy. Reports stated that he ignored initial warnings from police to move before being issued the fine. He was also reportedly double-fisting his Italian ice cream with a beer and was out past most people's bedtime at nearly 1 a.m.

CNN reports that this American wasn't singled out: Local police told the news site they carried out more than 300 ""decorum"" checks over the same weekend, looking to enforce the laws that were updated in 2019 in part to deal with unruly tourists. And despite the fine, Roman authorities may have actually taken it a bit easy on the man: Apparently, police can also choose to ban people from certain areas for up to 48 hours for not following the rules.

Good luck enjoying the beauty of the fountain after that!",Q3

Stephanie Williams, 40, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Wallace Robinson, 44, according to Mesa police.

Robinson died of injuries from the June 8 fire near Power and Broadway roads , according to police. Robinson had been in a coma at the Maricopa Medical Center after suffering third-degree burns to 67% of his body, court records state.

""I had to do it. He was going to kill me,"" Wiiliams reportedly said while being taken to the hospital after the fire, according to court documents.

Investigators found the origin of the fire was on a bed Robinson was lying on with burn patterns ""highly"" suggesting he was on his stomach, according to court documents.

Williams' car, rubber gloves found in the vehicle, the mattress pad and some burned fabric all tested positive for gasoline, according to court documents. A can with fuel was found concealed behind a bush near an apartment where Williams ran for help during the fire, documents state.

The investigation determined Robinson was lying on his stomach on the bed when he was doused with gasoline that was ignited as residual fumes caused an explosion leaving Williams burned, according to court documents.

An investigation found calls to police for domestic violence were made over the course of two years, with several calls made in the weeks leading up to the fire, according to court documents.

It is unclear whether Robinson or Williams, or both, made these calls.

A week before the fire, court records state, Robinson alleged Williams set a rug on fire. Williams accused Robinson of squirting her with lighter fluid, but she had no visible injuries after this alleged incident, records state.

After the June 8 fire, according to court records, Williams was placed into a medically induced coma at the medical center with burns on her arms, hands, face and legs.

Police spoke to Williams on Tuesday while she remained hospitalized. Williams recalled the events from immediately after the fire but not anything from immediately before, according to charging documents.

Williams made a ""vague"" statement about Robinson threatening to kill her, according to court records.

""Premeditation is shown in that Williams had to acquire, transport in her car, transport into the room, pour on Robinson, and then ignite the gasoline she used to kill Robinson,"" court documents state.

Following the interview with police, Williams attempted to leave the care facility in the middle of the night with her hands bandaged, a tracheal tube in her throat and a nasal feeding tube, court documents detail.

(KLKN) – The Banner County Fire Department said Thursday that crews are making progress to contain the wildfire that began on Tuesday near Nebraska’s border.

The fire has spread an additional 38 acres and now covers 3,738 acres in Banner County.

“We are estimating containment of the fire at 28% and will work to increase that line of black around the perimeter today,” incident commander Tim Grubbs said. “We are hopeful we will be able to release some of the air assets this afternoon if all goes well.”

There have been no reported injuries, accidents or homes destroyed so far in the fire.

Wednesday night, the fire calmed down, giving crews time to monitor conditions around the perimeter, the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said.

Eleven Republican attorneys general condemned the search of Trump’s Florida home, calling it a “ransacking” effort of the Biden administration to undermine Trump.

Lead by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the 21-page brief provide four examples, which includes the response to Covid-19 as well as its enforcement of immigration laws. He argues that the Biden administration has “leveraged its power to engage in questionable political gamesmanship” in an effort to convince the courts that the Department of Justice should not have immediate access to the classified documents.

Paxton’s actions are in response to the DOJ’s appeal of a decision to block the agency from viewing classified documents taken from Trump’s property until they can be reviewed by a third party, to which the department has argued that by delaying the investigation it would harm national security.

The GOP attorneys general believe that the Biden administration’s “questionable conduct” in policymaking and litigation means that the courts should tread the DOJ’s appeal with caution.

However the Republicans attorneys general said that the agency’s intention should be reviewed “through jaundiced eyes.""

The amicus brief urges the appellate court to deny the appeal. “Given Biden’s track record, combined with his rhetoric demonizing anyone he disagrees with, the courts must be on high alert to the ways in which [the Justice Department] may abuse its power to punish President Donald Trump,” Paxton said in a statement.

The FBI seized more than 11,000 documents from Trump’s Florida home during the raid. It was a part of a whole scheme lead by the Left to try and nail Trump down once and for all.

Police say the killing of a Muslim man on Friday night in Albuquerque may be linked to the ambush shooting deaths of three Muslim men over the past nine months in New Mexico's biggest city.

Police said Saturday that the victim in the latest killing was a Muslim from South Asia who is believed to be in his mid-20s. The man, whose identity hasn't yet been confirmed by investigators, was found dead after police received a call of a shooting.

Earlier this week, police confirmed that local detectives and federal law enforcement officers were looking for possible ties among the separate crimes. Two of the men — Muhammed Afzaal Hussain, 27, and Aftab Hussein, 41 — were killed in the past week, and both were from Pakistan and members of the same mosque. The third case involves the November killing of Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, a Muslim man of South Asian descent.

""There is reason to believe this death is related to those shootings,"" Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said during a news conference Saturday.

Police declined to say whether the killing on Friday night was carried out in a way similar to the other deaths.

Authorities say they can't say yet if the shootings were hate crimes until they have identified a suspect and can determine a motive.

The killings came as Albuquerque is on pace for another record-setting year of homicides.

""Our community has been devastated, as you can imagine,"" said Ahmad Assed, the president of Islamic Center of New Mexico. ""We have never gone through anything like this before. This is really a surreal time for us.""

Report details wreckage of fatal New Mexico helicopter crash – By Associated Press

Federal transportation authorities said Friday that a helicopter returning home from a firefighting mission made a rapid descent without making any turns before plowing into the ground last month, killing the four first responders onboard.

Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board released their preliminary report, noting that two witnesses on a ridge about half a mile away were observing the sunset when they saw the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office helicopter go down in the hills near the northern New Mexico community of Las Vegas.

It could take a year or more to make a final determination on the cause of the July 16 crash. It marked the single deadliest incident for law enforcement in state history and one of the deadliest for first responders.

The preliminary report detailed the crash scene, noting that the main wreckage was found upside down about 160 feet (48 meters) beyond the area where the helicopter first crashed. One main rotor blade had minimal damage and the other blade was fractured, with the broken part found nearby.

One of the four people onboard managed to call 911 before succumbing to his injuries, according to emergency dispatch recordings. That call to San Miguel County dispatchers sparked a frantic search.

A rancher who also called 911 said she saw dust when the helicopter hit the ground but no smoke or flames.

In emergency dispatch recordings, it was reported that gas was leaking from the aircraft, which the crew fully refueled for the trip home to Albuquerque.

They had spent a few hours that afternoon dropping buckets of water on a wildfire burning on private land near Las Vegas.

The crew included Bernalillo County Undersheriff Larry Koren, Lt. Fred Beers, Deputy Michael Levison and Bernalillo County Fire Rescue Specialist Matthew King. During memorial services over the last two weeks, the men were remembered as heroes for always being ready to serve beyond their jurisdiction.

Koren, 55, was a veteran pilot who had been with the the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office for more than two decades. He was part of a New Year's Day mission to rescue employees and a tram operator who got stuck while descending in the Sandia Peak Aerial Tramway.

Beers, 51, also helped with that winter rescue and had been with the sheriff's office for 13 years. Levison, 30, had been with the sheriff's office since 2017 and had served in the New Mexico Air National Guard.

The recordings show King, 44, a husband and father of two children, was the one who dialed 911. Mortally wounded, he stayed on the line for more than a half hour trying to direct first responders to the crash site. Efforts by the state police officers who were first on the scene to resuscitate him were unsuccessful.

New Mexico authorities investigate killings of 3 Muslim men – By Associated Press

Police in New Mexico's largest city are trying to determine if the ambush shooting deaths of three Muslim men over the past nine months could be connected.

Albuquerque police have confirmed that local detectives and federal law enforcement officers are looking for possible ties among the separate crimes. Two of the men — Muhammed Afzaal Hussain, 27, and Aftab Hussein, 41 — were killed in the past week, and both were from Pakistan and members of the same mosque. The third case involves the November killing of Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, a Muslim man of South Asian descent.

Deputy Police Commander Kyle Hartsock wouldn't share specifics, but he said the commonality among the victims is race and religion.

""We are taking this very seriously. We want the public's help in identifying this cowardly individual,"" Hartsock said during a news conference Thursday in front of the Islamic Center of New Mexico.

The governor, Albuquerque's mayor and civil rights groups have raised concerns, saying violence against members of the community based on race or religion will not be tolerated.

Hartsock reiterated that authorities can't say yet if the shootings were hate crimes until they have identified a suspect and can determine a motive.

The killings came as Albuquerque is on pace for another record-setting year of homicides.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations on Friday offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the shooting deaths. The council is the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization.

""If a bias-motive is determined, state and federal authorities should apply appropriate hate crime charges,"" said Nihad Awad, the director of the national group.

The two most recent killings were in southeast Albuquerque. Ahmadi was killed behind the market and cafe he owned with his brother.

""In all three cases, the victims were ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,"" Hartsock said.

Ahmad Assed, the president of Islamic Center of New Mexico, said he didn't believe the three victims knew one another, according to the Albuquerque Journal.

""The community certainly is in need of understanding the egregiousness of the conduct displayed in all three of theses shootings,"" Assed said at a news conference. ""If it's true that we were targeted as Muslims, then they need to be very vigilant in protecting themselves and taking measures of precaution. They need to watch out for their surroundings.""

SUV barrels through Native American parade; 15 injured – By Felicia Fonseca, Associated Press

A New Mexico man who was driving drunk without a valid license barreled through a parade that celebrates Native American culture in the western part of the state, injuring at least 15 people, officials said Friday.

Jeff Irving, 33, was arrested late Thursday and faces charges that include aggravated driving while intoxicated, fleeing from officers and injuring parade-goers and two Gallup police officers who tried to stop the vehicle, court documents said.

In a statement, New Mexico State Police said that investigators have no reason to suspect the crime was motivated by hate. No one was killed. The people who were hurt, including the police officers, suffered mostly minor injuries, said New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham

Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and his family were among those almost hit as the Chevrolet Tahoe drove through the parade route. The vehicle sped through downtown Gallup about 15 minutes after the nighttime parade started that served as the kick-off event for the 10-day Gallup Intertribal Ceremonial Centennial Celebration.

Irving's blood-alcohol content was three times the legal limit for driving, according to court records. His license had been revoked or suspended for another drunken driving charge and the SUV had no registration or insurance, police said.

Court records didn't list an attorney for Irving who could speak on his behalf. His two passengers were detained and taken to a detox center in Gallup, a city of about 22,000 people, state police said in the statement.

Many among the crowd of thousands lining the parade route in front of businesses that sell Native American jewelry, arts and crafts captured the chaotic scene on video.

As the SUV sped near the parade, videos on social media showed people yelling for others to get out of the way and some pushing parade-goers to safety. One video showed parade-goers yelling obscenities at the SUV's driver and passengers while they were handcuffed on the ground.

Children performing traditional dances appear to have been among the first to have seen the SUV heading toward them, the videos showed. They ran to the side amid screams and others scrambling to get out of the way.

The images also showed blankets, shoes, banners and umbrellas left strewn along the street and on the sidewalks as people fled.

Lujan Grisham said Friday that the state will send additional police officers and a behavioral heath crisis team to Gallup for the rest of the ceremonial event.

Nez said the vehicle was coming at him and a group of tribal officials marching in the parade. He thanked people for taking quick action to get spectators and participants out of harm's way.

""We just ask for your prayers for all of the participants,"" Nez said in a video posted on social media. ""We're all shook up. You would see this on television, you would think it would never happen here. I'm sorry to say it happened here in Gallup, New Mexico.""

Tonya Jim said she went to the parade with her parents, grandchildren and children. Her 5-year-old granddaughter, KaRiah, was picked from the crowd to join a group of dancers. Shortly after, the vehicle barreled down the parade route, turned and hit a man across from them who was sitting on a folding chair, she said. KaRiah was helped off the road by someone and was not hurt.

""I'm glad whoever was holding her hand just kept holding her hand and ran with her to get her off the road,"" Jim said. ""I'm not sure who she was, but I'm thankful for her.""

Jim said the family burned cedar and prayed when they got home and did a tobacco smoke prayer Friday morning to calm down.

""I blessed my kids and thanked the creator they are still with me and (to) pray for the families who are hurt,"" said Jim, who is Navajo and lives in Fort Defiance.

During the mayhem, the SUV swerved onto a side street and pulled into a parking spot before trying to pull out again. It hit a parked car and backed into a police car, state police said. Officers converged on the vehicle and detained the driver and two passengers who Irving identified as his brothers, according to court documents.

Irving initially told police he was not drinking before admitting to having at least a couple of beers, according to court documents. He is from the small community of Pinedale and faces 21 charges, the documents and police said.

City, state and tribal officials met Friday, with some urging more resources to address alcohol abuse. The state has long had a driving while impaired rate above the U.S. national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""I think there's always room for improvement,"" said Gallup police Capt. Erin Toadlena-Pablo. ""I don't think anyone should ever look at it and say we're doing all we can. There's always other means.""

The nighttime parade is a highlight of the ceremonial celebration, which was founded in 1922 as a way for traders to showcase the culture and art of Native American tribes in the region, said Gallup Intertribal Indian Ceremonial Association board President Kyle Tom.

A daytime parade will go on as planned on Aug. 13, the day before closing events, Tom said. Other events include dances, rodeos and a juried art show.

People travel to Gallup from the vast Navajo Nation that extends into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah and from other tribal reservations to attend the parades and events. Nez, tribal lawmakers and others expressed anger and disbelief over what happened.

""It's supposed to be a celebration, but today it was a difficult time for us,"" Nez said.

Tear gas grenade thrown by Bernalillo County deputy caused deadly house fire, investigators say – By Austin Fisher, Source New Mexico

The only possible cause of the fire that killed Brett Rosenau, 15, last month was a grenade thrown by a Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputy who was a member of the SWAT team that July night, local fire officials said Friday.

The Fire/Arson Investigation Division of Albuquerque Fire Rescue ruled the fire an accident, and discussed preliminary findings during a news conference on Friday.

It is extremely likely that the fire was caused by a Tri-Chamber Flameless Grenade thrown through a front window of the house, said Jason Ramirez, captain of the fire/arson investigation division.

The grenade emits CS gas, commonly known as tear gas.

“So at this time, the classification of that fire is ruled accidental, and we were unable to eliminate that device being an ignition source,” Ramirez told reporters on Friday. “All other ignition sources in the room were eliminated at this point. So that’s where we’re at in the investigation. At this point in our investigation, there is no other possibility in that room of origin, in that area.”

The grenade landed on a mattress behind the window, said Albuquerque Police Commander Kyle Hartsock. Hartsock displayed a video showing the grenade smoking, and the mattress catching fire. The video shows police using a robot to pull the flaming mattress out of the house, but at that point the fire had spread.

Firefighters delayed entering the building because, Albuquerque Police Chief Medina has said, there were concerns Kelley was armed, and he was still inside. It remains unclear if police actually found any weapons on Kelley or in the home.

After Kelley surrendered, firefighters searched the house and found Rosenau’s body inside, Hartsock said.",Q3
https://www.blogto.com/city/2022/08/it-just-got-harder-to-throw-airbnb-party-toronto/,It just got even harder to throw an Airbnb party in Toronto,"Stretch-SUV rental companies and cheap champagne manufacturers are about to lose a huge segment of their markets, as those rowdy Airbnb parties you love to hate are coming to an end for good.

At least that's the goal of the service's latest anti-party features.

The short-term rental company and scourge of the hospitality industry announced its new anti-party tools in the U.S. and Canada on Tuesday, effectively killing the rogue industry of condos-turned-party pads in Toronto complexes (like too many units within the ICE Condos.)

Airbnb claims that the long-anticipated introduction of anti-party tools will ""help identify potentially high-risk reservations and prevent those users from taking advantage of our platform.""

The move comes on the heels of a June announcement that the short-term rental agency's previous temporary ban on parties would become codified policy, amid pressure from both hosts and municipalities on Airbnb to clamp down on parties thrown without the knowledge or consent of hosts.

The tool works by analyzing factors including past reviews, the length of time a guest has been using Airbnb, length of trip, distance to listing, day of the week, and several other data points to ""reduce the ability of bad actors to throw unauthorized parties which negatively impact our hosts, neighbors, and the communities we serve.""

If a guest checks too many of the wrong boxes, the anti-party technology is designed to block a reservation from going through. It won't ban a user from making a booking using the service, but guests attempting to book entire homes with the intent of hosting parties will instead be given the option to book a private room or hotel suite through Airbnb.

Similar technology has already been in play in Australia under a pilot project since Oct. 2021, resulting in a 35 per cent drop in incidents of unauthorized parties in areas covered by the pilot.

The upgraded security system is described as a ""more robust and sophisticated version of the 'under-25' system that has been in effect in North America since 2020, which focuses primarily on guests under the age of 25 without positive reviews who are booking locally.""

It will undoubtedly bring more peace of mind to Airbnb hosts, but the service admits in a press release that ""no system is perfect,"" and that while the system is designed to ""deter bad actors,"" the release suggests Airbnb's nature as an online platform can't necessarily put a stop to unauthorized parties altogether.",Q3
https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/investigations/nbc-7-investigates-san-diego-police-face-scrutiny-over-womans-murder/2993513/,NBC 7 Investigates: San Diego Police Face Scrutiny Over Woman's Murder,"Nearly two hours before police arrived to find a woman dead in her apartment, neighbors had been calling 911 begging for help while fearing for their own safety. NBC 7’s Alexis Rivas has the story.

Wilted flowers mark the outdoor staircase leading up to the condo where police say a San Diego man murdered Connie Dadkhah, 45. That man, Parrish Chambers Jr., 44, is now sitting in a jail cell without bail awaiting trial for murder.

Yet three of Connie’s neighbors who spoke with NBC 7 Investigates feel police deserve some of the blame.

“Had they just done their job, she would still be alive,” said Michelle.

“It’s incredibly upsetting,” said Mike. “It’s really unbelievable. Very, very scary.”

“I just feel such a strange combination of anxiety and anger and sadness,” said Sally. “It could have been prevented.”

In order to protect their identities, NBC 7 Investigates is using fictitious names for the neighbors.

Connie Dadkhah Family

“Had they just done their job, she would still be alive.” Michelle

NBC 7 Investigates Reporter Alexis Rivas is getting new insight into claims that San Diego police failed a murder victim. Neighbors believe the woman's life could have been saved if police had handled their calls for help differently.

Officers found Connie’s lifeless body inside her condo Wednesday morning, June 15. But neighbor interviews, dispatch records, 911 call timestamps and surveillance video all gathered by NBC 7 Investigates show the calls for help started nearly 12 hours earlier.

Around 7 p.m. the night before two neighbors called 911 reporting a man banging on Connie’s door and screaming. Over the next hour, at least five more calls rolled into 911, but no officers were dispatched. Then, just after 8 p.m., neighbors heard and saw something that prompted dispatchers to speed up the police response.

“He somehow managed to climb onto her balcony and break through her glass door. So he broke in,” said Sally.

“I told them [police] that there is an active burglary happening to my neighbor’s house,” said Michelle. “I’m looking at him through the window. He entered through the second-story sliding glass door, he busted the door.”



Sally told NBC 7 Investigates she was still on the line with the dispatcher when she heard a physical fight.

“I’ve never heard somebody that angry in my entire life,” said Sally. “He was running so hard that I genuinely thought he might break through the ceiling. I remember saying verbatim, ‘He’s going to kill her.’”

At that point, dispatch records show the call was upgraded to a higher priority, and officers started staging at a parking lot nearby. About 45 minutes later, they arrived at Connie’s condo and knocked on the door.

“They finally show up,” said Michelle. “They’re walking up and I’m noticing them looking around and I come out of my door and I point to the unit and I say he’s in there, and they just nodded their heads. So they flashed their light, they could totally see the broken glass.”

Police say officers tried calling Connie’s phone and looked for her car. But since Connie didn’t answer the door, officers ultimately left.

“At this point, I'm like what is going on?” said Michelle. “Where are they going? What’s happening? You have no idea what he’s going to do. He can easily break into someone else’s home. Especially on the first floor if he got into the second floor. And I was thinking why is it not an emergency? Why are they just walking away?”

The next morning, just before 8:30 a.m., police say Chambers came outside and told a neighbor to call 911 because Connie was dead. Surveillance video obtained by NBC 7 Investigates shows officers arresting Chambers minutes later.

NBC 7 Investigates has learned this is not the first time police have been called to Connie’s home. In fact, Chambers was not even supposed to be near Connie. A judge ordered Chambers to stay away from Connie as one of his probationary terms for a vandalism conviction in 2020.

“The victim in that case was actually the victim of the homicide as well,” said the prosecutor during Chambers’ preliminary hearing.

“I was just overcome with grief,” said Shannon Jones.

Jones says Connie meant a lot to him over their 15-year-long friendship. At one point the two even dated.

“Just devastated,” Jones said. “She was one of the closest people in my life.”

Shannon Jones

While he may be devastated, Jones told NBC 7 Investigates he wasn’t totally surprised to hear about her murder. Unfortunately, Jones says her alleged killer was no stranger to Connie, him or the police.

“He was a stalker, and a user, and an abuser,” said Jones.

Jones shared cell phone video with NBC 7 Investigates, taken back in October 2020. In the video, he claims Connie called him to help get Chambers out of her apartment.

Shannon Jones

Jones said Chambers met Connie through her volunteer work with mental health outreach, became smitten with her, tracked down her address, and constantly visited despite repeated requests that Chambers leave her alone. Both Jones and a neighbor told us Chambers occasionally assaulted Connie, and the times that police were called, he wasn’t arrested.

“It had been going on for a year and a half, almost two years,” said Jones. “And it was all her responsibility to make it stop. That’s the way they made it seem.”

Lt. Steven Shebloski with the San Diego Police Homicide Unit told NBC 7 Investigates that the officers who responded last month upheld their oath to protect Connie.



“They were making the best decision they had based on the information at the time,” said Shebloski. “And, at the end of the day and the following day, did a tragedy happen? Absolutely, but I don't think that’s because of the officers’ response.”

He says no officers were dispatched in the first hour because the calls were initially categorized as a lower priority event.

POLICE RESPONSE TIMELINE:

“Unfortunately those calls can stack in terms of time of dispatch to the time of response,” said Shebloski.

But remember, even after dispatchers upgraded it to a higher priority, it still took officers another 45 minutes to knock on the front door.

“In this case, officers had information on that particular address involving the male that lived there, or at least their impression of the male that lived there,” said Shebloski when asked why it took so long for officers to arrive. “So one of the things they did is that they had a meeting beforehand to have resources in place, especially less lethal options, in order to contact the person that lived there in a safe manner.”

When asked why officers didn’t go inside the unit, Shebloski said that officers couldn’t verify a disturbance was taking place, didn’t hear anything and didn’t see anyone.

The lieutenant went on to say, “There was a reasonable interpretation that this man lived there.” Shebloski describes a confidential police record known as a Prior Activity Code (PAC) file which gives responding officers a history or notes about the address they are being dispatched to. He says that file indicated that Chambers had been contacted there before.

After NBC 7 Investigates broke this story, we continued to push SDPD for more answers about that PAC file. Ultimately, police agreed to unredact part of the PAC file from a Call For Service report we had obtained. That report was from an incident on April 22 between Chambers and Connie.

It says the following: “If CFS (Call For Service) comes out with this address, have three (3) officers, a SGT, and a K9 respond.”

It then mentions Parrish Chambers by name, and includes redacted information about his criminal history. Police tell us the mention of Chambers in the address history is what led officers to believe he lives there, even though it does not explicitly state he is a resident.

“When you’re going to force entry into someone’s home, that is the highest level of legal standard we operate under,” said Shebloski. “So you have to be on point legally and tactically. Because if officers go in and make the wrong decision on a poor guy that left his keys in there and broke into his own house and a significant use of force, or God forbid officers use deadly force, there is going to be a lot of hard questions asked of that supervisor and those officers.”

The officers responding on June 14 would not have seen any of the other information included in that April 22 report. That included officers telling dispatch there were visible injuries on Connie, that there was no prior domestic relationship with Chambers, and that she did not want to pursue charges against him. Officers advised her to lock all her doors and call police if he came back. That same report ends with officers explicitly telling dispatchers that Chambers does not live at her address.

Police also say officers would have had the ability to run a criminal background check on Chambers and also pull information that could have revealed his court order to stay away from Connie. However, they say it’s unclear if officers conducted those checks.

While Shebloski stands with the officers who responded that night, he says he can understand the community’s concerns.

“The people who called in, they did everything right,” said Shebloski. “They called 911. They repeatedly called back. They did everything right. I understand why people are upset. The chief understands why people are upset. That is not lost upon us and our thoughts and prayers are with the family.”

While Shebloski says officers “get it right” the vast majority of the time, he says the chief’s office is now reviewing the police response in this incident. He says that’s standard in “critical incidents.”

“It felt awful,” said Sally. “I was on the phone with the police. They were not showing up. I was literally hiding in a closet panicking for her safety as well as my own safety.”

Connie Dadkhah Family

Back in Rancho Penasquitos, neighbors tell us if there’s a next time, they’re not sure they should bother to call 911.

“I have zero confidence in the police,” said Sally. “This has taught me I need to take my safety into my own hands. Truly I feel like the police are not here for me, are not here to help.”

“I’m very angry,” said Michelle. “How do I know they’re going to be here for me if I need to call them? How do I know they’re going to be here for my children if they need to call them? How can I trust that?”

“It felt awful. I was on the phone with the police. They were not showing up. I was literally hiding in a closet panicking for her safety as well as my own safety.” Sally

While they believe Connie would still be alive if the police responded differently, they hope in death, her case can prompt change.

“Her compassion and empathy was limitless,” said Jones. “She was one of the most beautiful and innocent souls I’ve ever known.”

The county still hasn’t released Connie’s cause of death.

In the meantime, Chambers has pleaded not guilty and is locked up without bail. He is scheduled to be back in court in mid-August. NBC 7 Investigates reached out to Chambers and his defense attorney. That public defender told us in an email “...being charged with a crime is not evidence that a crime that actually committed, and Mr. Chambers is presumed innocent at this point in the litigation.”

Public records obtained by NBC 7 Investigates showed other police calls placed around the time of Connie’s murder. Seven of the 10 officers that ultimately responded were at a suicide call from roughly 7 to 8 p.m. And two of the other officers were working a road rage incident before they all started staging to respond to Connie’s condo at 8 pm.

However, regardless of what else may have been going on that night, dispatchers initially assigned this as a Priority 2 call which has a response time standard of 27 minutes. About an hour later it was upgraded to a Priority 1 call, which has a response time standard of 14 minutes. Police failed to meet both standards.

Michael Miles, 32, pleaded guilty to the killing of 39-year-old Rolando Saenz Jr. and gave no statement before hearing St. Joseph Superior Court Judge John Marnocha's order.

Court documents in the case detail that Saenz and Miles were both at Cheers in the early morning hours of Dec. 16, but the two men didn't know each other. The pair got into a fight, however, and Miles fired a shot which didn't hit anyone. Bar staff wrestled Miles outside, but he continued scuffling and came back in to shoot Saenz in the chest.

Documents say Saenz, who lived in South Bend, later died in the hospital.

The altercation, which Miles' attorney emphasized was instigated by Saenz, and shooting were both captured on the bar's security cameras and Miles was arrested a few days later with the help of video and witness identification. Neither prosecutors nor Miles detailed what specifically caused the fight. Court documents state only there was ""an altercation between (Saenz), two females, and (Miles).""

Miles eventually pleaded guilty to murder last month, in exchange for prosecutors dropping an additional firearm possession charge. Miles was on parole stemming from an armed robbery conviction in Michigan at the time of the shooting.

Before issuing his sentencing decision, Marnocha heard from Saenz's mother, who repeatedly asked Miles why he shot her son.

""Since I don’t know you and you don’t know me, I want to ask, why did you make this choice?"" the woman asked.

Miles did not respond.",Q3

https://www.adgully.com/amidst-ongoing-disputes-with-indian-authorities-twitter-demonstrates-its-connectivity-in-india-120200.html,"Amidst ongoing disputes with Indian authorities, Twitter demonstrates its connectivity in India","Twitter is attempting to emphasise how helpful the app is to Indian users during its current battle with Indian authorities, who have tried to restrict specific discussions on the app. This move appears to be part of a bigger attempt to prevent the Indian Government from outlawing the programme.

Twitter India is attempting to demonstrate the value that the app has given to Indian users in a number of ways in a new series of user tales.The #WeMetOnTwitter hashtag tries to connect the stories of friendship,partnership through Twitter connections and according to Twitter, the number of Tweets with the tag surged by 380 percent between January and June 2022, demonstrating its importance in the area.

As previously mentioned, Twitter is currently embroiled in a serious legal dispute with Indian authorities over the latter's frequent requests for Twitter to restrict particular topics in the app.

Early last year, the Indian government asked Twitter to block hundreds of users who had participated in protests in the area. Twitter cooperated, but later went back on its promise, placing it against the local government.

After that, Twitter has frequently received requests from the Indian government to outlaw particular trends and buzzwords. Local Twitter officials have found it difficult to comply with these requests while also promoting user freedom of speech.

In the most recent instance, the Indian government urged Twitter to block several profiles with ties to Pakistan. Once again going head-to-head with the Indian Government, Twitter has questioned those bans in court. If successful, this might result in a complete ban of Twitter from the region, cutting off its 38 million local users.

Due to an ongoing border conflict with the Chinese government, India blocked TikTok in 2020 inspite of having more than 200 million domestic users at the time. Since its prohibition, TikTok has continued to call for its reinstatement in the area, which highlights Twitter's anxiety over potential future legal action from the Indian government.

Twitter does not, however, wish to be employed as a tool for repressive countries' propaganda.

Twitter's original ""public town square"" approach to interaction and enabling everyone to have a voice are key to its culture. It is impossible for overt censorship, as mandated by the ruling government, to be a part of this, which is why Twitter is suing against the most recent directives - albeit, once again, this might make the platform unpopular with local officials.

That's why it's trying to emphasise how important it is to the neighbourhood and how it can link users there.",Q3

World World Russia says no US visas yet for Lavrov visit to United Nations

Russia has asked for 56 visas from US to allow Russian FM and his delegation to travel to New York.

03 September,2022 07:44 am

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia has asked for 56 visas from the United States to allow Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his delegation to travel to New York for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations this month, but so far has received none.

In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters on Friday (Sep 2), Russia s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said that this was ""alarming"" because during the past several months Washington had ""been constantly refusing to grant entry visas"" to a number of Russian delegates for other UN events.

The United States takes seriously its obligations as UN host country, said a State Department spokesperson, adding that visa records are confidential under US law so it could not comment on individual cases.

Under the 1947 UN ""headquarters agreement"", the United States is generally required to allow access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats. But Washington says that it can deny visas for ""security, terrorism and foreign policy"" reasons.

The relationship between the US and Russia has ruptured since Moscow invaded neighbouring Ukraine in February.

""We process hundreds of visas every year for Russian Federation delegates to UN events,"" said the State Department spokesperson, adding that applications should be submitted as early as possible to ensure timely processing.

""This is especially important because of Russia s unwarranted actions against our embassy in Russia, including the forced termination of local and third country national staff, which have severely limited our staffing and therefore our capacity to process visas,"" the spokesperson said.

Nebenzia said that the necessary applications had been submitted to the US embassy in Moscow.

UN ENGAGED WITH US

The 56 visas requested by Moscow include those for an advance team of diplomats to prepare for the arrival of Lavrov and his delegation for the high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York, which begins on Sep 20.

Nebenzia added that no US visas had yet been granted to journalists accompanying Lavrov and the flight crew.

He asked Guterres to ""once again emphasise to the authorities of the United States that they must promptly issue requested visas for all Russian delegates and accompanying persons, including Russian journalists"".

Guterres and other senior UN officials are in close contact with the United States and Russia over the visas, said UN spokesperson Eri Kaneko.

""We proactively engage with the US Mission on visas ... and liaise with the Mission on specific cases that are brought to our attention. We are doing so in this case,"" Kaneko said.

The United States has long restricted Russian UN diplomats and visiting Russian delegations from travelling more than 25 miles (40km) from New York City without Washington s prior approval.

In February, Washington slapped sanctions on Lavrov, accusing him of being ""directly responsible for Russia s unprovoked and unlawful further invasion of Ukraine"".

The sanctions freeze any assets Lavrov may have in the United States and generally bar Americans from dealing with him.

Nebenzia cited some recent visa issues in his letter to Guterres, saying that Russia s Internal Affairs Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev was unable to travel to New York for a UN Chiefs of Police summit this week.

He said that representatives of Russian law enforcement agencies were also unable to attend a UN event this week on countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes.

Anthony DeMarco, a Leon County Schools parent with a background in informational technology, and Marianne Arbulu, who was a school board member and superintendent for Jefferson County Schools, are vying to unseat Striplin, who has been on the school board for eight years.

Arbulu was a Jefferson County School Board member from 2008-2012 and superintendent from 2016 to 2020. In 2017, during her tenure as superintendent, the state took over the school district and handed responsibilities to Somerset Academy, Inc., to deal with failing grades, staffing issues and missing funds. It had the distinction of being the only school district in Florida run by a charter school until this year.

""The state could not arbitrarily remove a newly elected constitutional officer without cause. Instead, the plan was revised to make my job so difficult, impossible, that I would acquiesce or resign,"" Arbulu said in a statement. ""The department advised me that I was expected to perform all duties required of every superintendent, however they would not approve any staff other than an administrative assistant.""

Arbulu said the state underestimated her abilities, and for four years, she led a fully functional district. Arbulu ran again for superintendent in 2020 but lost the race to Eydie Triquet.

Striplin, who butted heads with Superintendent Rocky Hanna in 2021 when he bucked the state with a more stringent masking policy, said the COVID-19 pandemic was the most difficult time as a school board member in her eigh- year tenure. During a candidate forum with the three candidates hosted by the Tallahassee Democrat, WFSU and the League of Women Voters, Striplin said she wished Superintendent Rocky Hanna had collaborated more with the board.

""He made some decisions without us, and I was very vocal that I was not pleased about not being included on some of those decisions,"" Striplin said.

Back story:

DeMarco staked out a position as the only candidate to reject Gov. Ron DeSantis' education agenda wholesale and to refuse to accept an endorsement from Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents’ group.

""I don't support them, wouldn't seek their endorsement, wouldn't want it, I don't think they would want my endorsement,"" he said. ""It's hard to isolate a message down when they're putting out messages like (transgender advocacy groups are) grooming.""

During the forum, which can be viewed on tallahassee.com, the three candidates also answered questions about parents' rights, the LGBTQ+ guide and teachers' salaries. Their answers appear below.

What is one way to quickly raise teachers' salaries?

Alva Striplin: I was provided about six options, I'm not going to share what they were with you, because I would like to have that discussion with my other board members. But I have asked for concrete... tell me what we're going to have to do. Don't tell me that we can't do it, tell me what we need to do to get them there. And I have those options in the back of my mind, we're going to discuss as a board.

Anthony DeMarco: Cut all administrative staff at the upper level salaries by 50%.

Marianne Arbulu: You've got to take away from something else, and you have to use recurring income if you're going to have a stable, financial picture. You cannot be dipping into reserves as we've done in the last year. Not being privy as Alva is to the superintendent's solutions, but there are solutions for this, and I agree that it's a critical area.

What is your opinion of the parental notification provision in the school's LGBTQ+ guide?

Anthony DeMarco: On the federal level, it violates a student's right to privacy of thought, a student's right to privacy. It's extremely invasive. I mean, are we going to ask them to sit at the back of the bus next? It's interesting we're having this conversation three days after, 56 years ago, the Tallahassee City Commission enacted a ban on African Americans using the bus.

Marianne Arbulu: I sat with the folks at that particular board meeting from the LGBTQ group, and I agree with their sentiments that the guide in itself instantly marginalizes students and makes it more difficult. If the goal is to mainstream them, then I'm not sure the guide accomplishes that. But, given that, I'm glad that the board approved the guide. It has flaws, and I know they'll go back to that in six months and look at it. So this is a work in progress.

Explainer:'Caught in the middle': Leon Schools LGBTQ+ guide explained as it draws viral spotlight

Alva Striplin: As the only person here who actually sat through that, I can tell you it is very challenging to meet the needs of all parent groups in our district and our students and to follow the Parent Bill of Rights, which we are bound to do by law. That is why that was in there. We absolutely are taking feedback on our guide, and we are going to revise it again, but we did the very best we could with what we had – to notify our parents, to follow the bill of rights, and to provide the supports needed to all of our student.

How should the school board respond to recent legislation restricting discussions about race, gender identity and sexual orientation in public schools?

Marianne Arbulu: The mission of our school district is to ensure that every student has a safe and welcoming and intellectually simulating environment. I think if we hone in on those values, then we can stay within the law, as we must, but also take care of individual student needs at the ground level.

Alva Striplin: The governor and the legislature obviously have every right to outline their priorities and push them through as law; that's what they were elected to do. My urging to our community and to the state would be that if you don't agree with some things that are happening, go and vote. Get involved at the state level. People come and lobby us at the local level, and often we don't have a lot of control. We are sworn officers to uphold the law and we will continue to do that, but get involved with state-wide races and vote.

Anthony DeMarco: I think the recent legislation is abhorrent. The thing that nobody has mentioned is that there are federal statutes and federal laws that we are in violation of currently as a result of trying to implement state laws. At the core, safety and equity, those are the two foundational needs for a high quality public education. And if you remove equity from the foundation, then you cannot deliver a high quality public education, and all that legislation does is remove equity.

https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/07/04/new-legal-settlement-protects-coyotes-wolves-in-idaho/,"New Legal Settlement Protects Coyotes, Wolves in Idaho","A settlement agreement between conservation groups and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management guarantees interim protections for native wildlife in Idaho pending the completion of new environmental reviews of the agencies’ actions. The settlement was reached pursuant to a lawsuit filed in Idaho District Court in 2020, asserting that Wildlife Services had violated federal law with regard to its predator management programs by relying on outdated and inadequate assessments of its policies and methods.

“We’re pleased to have added restrictions to the wildlife-killing activities that USDA Wildlife Services is pursuing across Idaho,” said Erik Molvar, Executive Director of Western Watersheds Project. “This new agreement blocks wildlife killing on protected public lands across Idaho, and blocks the use of certain lethal methods employed against native carnivores throughout the state.”

The settlement gives Wildlife Services until the end of 2024 to complete a new environmental review of its activities on federal lands, and mandates that the agency will consider an alternative restricting predator killing on certain public lands, blocking “preventative” killing of wolves and coyotes, and placing a long-term moratorium on M-44 “cyanide bomb” use.

“This settlement forces the federal agencies to come up to speed on the new science around management of native carnivores and to stop using inhumane and antiquated methods like poison or body-gripping traps,” said Lindsay Larris, Wildlife Program Director of WildEarth Guardians. “This settlement ensures that Wildlife Services won’t use gas cartridges or burn wolves alive in their dens – a practice they were unfortunately still able to lawfully employ, until today.”

In the interim, the parties agreed on a number of measures that will help protect Idaho’s native predators. The agreement halts the use of “denning” (gassing or immolating wolf pups in their dens), limits the agency’s methods of trapping, and requires reporting if Wildlife Services traps go un-checked for more than 72 hours. This is an important measure to prevent animal cruelty.

“Our settlement also means that native predators that live in Wilderness or Wilderness Study Areas in Idaho will not be killed by Wildlife Services except to protect human health and safety,” said Laurie Rule, Senior Attorney at Advocates for the West, which along with counsel from Western Watersheds Project is representing the conservation groups in the case. “These areas are intended to remain in their natural state, including allowing predators to fulfill their natural role in the ecosystem.”

The settlement follows a March 2020 settlement in an earlier lawsuit that substantially restricted the places where Wildlife Services could kill wolves in Idaho. Predator protections under both agreements will be in place until Wildlife Services completes a new environmental impact statement in 2024.

This new settlement extends the statewide ban on M-44 “cyanide bombs” of the type that poisoned 14-year-old Canyon Mansfield and his dog near Pocatello, killing the family dog, in 2017.

“Working side-by-side with the Mansfield family, as well as with other M-44 victims for over 30 years, I have witnessed the pain and loss these indiscriminate poisonous devices inflict,” said Brooks Fahy, executive director of Predator Defense, a national wildlife advocacy group. “Since M-44s can never be used safely, Wildlife Services agreeing not to use them in Idaho, even temporarily until their analysis is complete, will better protect people, pets and wildlife.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his nightly televised address to the nation hailed Monday as a “very important day” as a conference devoted to the recovery of his country commenced in Lugano, Switzerland.

But he said the reconstruction of Ukraine should go beyond “the restoration of the walls that we had and that were destroyed by shelling.”

“Ukraine must become the freest, most modern and safest country in Europe — in every sense of the word, in particular, in terms of our environment. I’m sure we will,” he said.

Zelensky warned that efforts on the recovery should not only focus on the next years but also on the present.

“Ukrainian forces liberated more than a thousand settlements from the occupiers, and new ones are added every week. Now, for example, in the south of our country. All of them suffered large-scale destruction. And this also means the need for colossal funds for the restoration of infrastructure, for the return of medicine and social services, for the restoration of normal economic life. There are tens of thousands of destroyed houses alone in the liberated areas,” he said, adding that “a significant part of the economy has been destroyed.”

“That is why the recovery of Ukraine is not only about what needs to be done later, after our victory, but also about what needs to be done at this time. And we have to do it together with our partners, with the entire democratic world. Do now,” he said.

Zelensky concluded his address by congratulating US President Joe Biden and the American people on Independence Day saying that responding to the daily Russian offensive requires “superhuman efforts.”

“But we have no alternative — this is about our independence, about our future, about the fate of the entire Ukrainian people,” he said.",Q3

CHICAGO, Sept. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Magnicity, the global operator and creator of innovative, experiential attractions high above notable cities, celebrates the grand opening of CloudBar on the 94th floor of the former John Hancock Center (875 N. Michigan Ave.). Situated over 1,000 feet above The Magnificent Mile at 360 CHICAGO Observation Deck, the new concept bar unveiled reimagines how tourist destinations feature hyper-local artisans and food and beverage partnerships to magnify a city's authentic best.

""We want each Magnicity location to act as a true city ambassador for our guests – encouraging exploration of the vibrant neighborhoods within our cities and forging new adventures and experiences. We are thrilled to introduce our brand-new bar concept with CloudBar,"" says Alexia Vettier, CEO of Magnicity, a Paris-based company that owns and operates 360 CHICAGO and other Magnicity experiences in landmark locations around the world.

Expect sky-high style and an exclusive showcase of Chicago's makers and artisans curated from the diverse communities admired in the city's distinct neighborhoods.

The $2M+ renovation and opening of CloudBar represents the most recent of a ten-year, $14M investment strategy at 360 CHICAGO, all with a goal of centering authentic Chicago stories and experiences in every aspect of the guest journey.

The Vibe

After a 42-second elevator ride whisks riders to breathtaking views from the 94th floor observation deck, guests often look down on the clouds from floor to ceiling windows. The Gettys GroupChicago design team purposefully extends this experience by giving guests a feeling of floating in the air. CloudBar interior design incorporates reflective surfaces as a tool to help create this immersive experience as a mirrored ceiling, smoked mirror drink rails, and a mirrored back wall at the 18-seat bar intensifies the grand views.

A wall of windows is lined with cozy ledges and seating, plus modern European furniture and lighting style which gives a stylish nod to the Magnicity ownership brand. Toned down, soft green upholstery reflects the Chicago local sensibility while giving a nod to Magnicity's brand color according to Ji hyun Kim, Director Gettys Interiors.

Local art is a crucial design element that not only sets the tone but also brings an authentic Chicago street experience to the space. A breeding ground for art and culture, Chicago is filled with phenomenal street art including that of Lauren Asta, a traveling muralist/artist based in Chicago. Specializing in freehand illustration, oddity art and street murals, she has created inspiring pieces in Chicago on over 40 walls such as gigantic murals in West Town, Pilsen, and the West Loop.

For CloudBar, Asta was commissioned to create original graphics that appear on large-scale architectural fabric that runs throughout the bar, and also on custom room dividers to define private event space. Each incorporates representations of Chicago street culture ranging from local neighborhood personalities to world recognized architecture.

The Food & Beverage

To strengthen and celebrate the distinctive fabric of our city, 360 CHICAGO has forged partnerships with a curated list of local makers. Moody Tongue, the world's first two Michelin star brewery, is excited to introduce the Magnicity Pilsner, a brew created in partnership with 360 CHICAGO and solely available at CloudBar.

Other important partners include Kit Kat Lounge & Supper Club, Vosges Chocolate, Garrett Popcorn, Carol's Cookies, and Kikwetu Coffee Company. By providing a unique platform for these local businesses, CloudBar seeks to introduce guests to these true Chicago brands and inspire a personal connection by sharing their products and stories.

In addition to featuring these dynamic partnerships, the menu at CloudBar is inspired by the culture and cocktails of many of the Chicago's neighborhoods. Guests will be able to both enjoy these true Chicago tastes while visiting 360 CHICAGO and also able to take home many of the city's best with a wide selection of thoughtfully packaged items for purchase.

""We recognize that food and drink bring communities together and we want to reinforce and amplify everything visitors and locals love about our city, while exposing our guests to iconic Chicago tastes and undiscovered new and exclusive flavor experiences,"" says Jennifer Hesser, assistant general manager for 360 CHICAGO.

CloudBar will soon offer pairings that speak specifically to neighborhoods – one dessert and two-to-three cocktails delivered with a descriptive card that informs the visitor why it's significant, how it's made, and the neighborhood and vendor story, providing not only a delicious education but a keepsake. Up to 10 of the 77 neighborhoods will be rotated in this focus throughout the year.

3 of 77: The Soul Of The Midwest

In addition to introducing CloudBar, 360 CHICAGO will also unveil the remarkable storytelling of local filmmaker Harvey Pullings II. Pulling's most recent work is a documentary entitled 3 of 77: The Soul Of The Midwest. This documentary exclusively commissioned by 360 CHICAGO is hosted by Jahmal Cole, founder of My Block My Hood My City, a nonprofit that also contributed to content coordination. The film introduces viewers to three diverse neighborhoods -- Bronzeville, Lakeview and Pilsen – through the lens of small businesses that call the neighborhoods home. The small businesses and local cultural institutions use their own stories to share the distinct history and culture of each neighborhood. A photography exhibit entitled The Culture: 3 of 77 supports this film with portraits of notable residents who represent and impact each neighborhood's personality.

""Both CloudBar and the exclusive documentary 3 of 77: The Soul Of The Midwest, represent a continuation and expansion of our 10-year commitment to sharing the stories of the people, communities and artisans that define our neighborhoods and the city of Chicago,"" says Nichole Benolken, managing director for 360 CHICAGO. ""Our further investment will appeal not only to tourists but young professionals seeking a strong local experience, and at the same time it allows small businesses to gain exposure to the international guests we draw. It's a win-win.""

That man did not survive.

HINCKLEY, Minn. — A central Minnesota man is charged with second-degree murder and a handful of other offenses after a dispute involving his former girlfriend and her current partner.

Prosecutors in Pine County detail the charges in a criminal complaint filed against 36-year-old John Thomas Quitter, who reportedly shot the victim while his ex was retrieving some property from a trailer where Quitter lives in Hinckley.

Pine County deputies were called to Essentia Hospital in Sandstone around 6 a.m. Sept. 6 and learned that someone had dropped off a man who appeared to have been shot in the chest by a shotgun shell containing bird shot. Doctors said the victim had more than 250 BB wounds, with a large number of them centered on the left side of his chest. That man did not survive.

Hospital personnel say the man who dropped the shooting victim left a note with the name John Quitter, a Hinckley address and a telephone number belonging to the victim's girlfriend, who is Quitter's ex. Quitter was asked to stay on scene but left in the victim's truck.

Investigators spoke with the girlfriend of the victim, who reportedly told them they had driven to the property where Quitter lived to retrieve some of her things. There, she said, she and the victim began arguing, and when she went inside the trailer the victim ran up and punched out a window. The woman told detectives she then heard a shot, ran outside and found the victim in his truck non-responsive.

She said Quitter then got in the truck and drove the man to the hospital.

BCA crime scene technicians were called in to search the property and found spent shells in the yard and a pump-style shotgun in the woods with a live round in the chamber.

Just before 1 p.m. that day authorities located the victim's truck driving on a Pine County Road and began pursuing it. Deputies say the man at the wheel, later identified as Quitter, was swerving from side to side and at one point the truck went airborne. When they were finally able to box him in and stop the pickup, deputies say Quitter refused to get out of the vehicle and had to be forcibly removed.

The criminal complaint says Quitter had blood on his clothing and on the driver's side door of the truck. Detectives who questioned him say the defendant denied shooting C.A., but at one point also stated he did shoot him but not intentionally.

A criminal records search says John Quitter is ineligible to possess firearms due to previous convictions for controlled substance crimes. Along with three counts involving second-degree murder, he is also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and fleeing police.

https://thedailyrecord.com/2022/07/26/frosh-legislature-needs-to-strengthen-gun-laws/,"General Assembly needs to strengthen gun laws, Frosh says","Listen to this article Listen to this article

Maryland’s outgoing attorney general said the state legislature needs to act quickly to strengthen gun laws.

Attorney General Brian Frosh said lawmakers will need to beef up state law to adapt to a United States Supreme Court decision he and others believe will substantially increase the number of people licensed to carry guns in Maryland.

“I think we need to do the best that we can to adapt to the Bruen decision by the Supreme Court,” Frosh said. “That means there are policies that the general assembly can strengthen and adopt to cure that.”

The Supreme Court in June struck down a New York wear and carry law in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen. The New York law was substantially similar to Maryland’s “good and substantial reason” rule that clamped down on the number of permits issued in the state.

“I think the Supreme Court just poured gasoline on the fire. We’ve got a public health epidemic in terms of gun violence,” said Frosh during a Tuesday event on guns sponsored by the Greater Baltimore Committee.

Included in the measures Frosh said the legislature should consider are restrictions similar to those passed by the New York legislature earlier this month.

“We have restrictions in place in Maryland but the problem is they’re not as extensive as they should be,” he said.

Those include limits on where guns can be carried including a ban on carrying on private property without the permission of the property owner.

“I hope that when the General Assembly adopts a constellation of restrictions like those, it will help us to adapt to a world in which more people are going to be carrying weapons as they go about their daily lives,” said Frosh.

Top Democratic lawmakers have already started meeting to look at ways state laws might be changed in response to the high court ruling.

Since the ruling, Frosh’s office has advised the Maryland State Police that it cannot continue to enforce the “good and substantial reason requirement.” A state appeals court raised similar concerns.

Republican Gov. Larry Hogan also ordered the agency to stop enforcing the law.

“I think the Supreme Court’s decision in Bruen is a radical departure from the kind of jurisprudence that we’ve seen on Constitutional interpretation and specifically on the 2nd Amendment,” said Frosh.

“They have blood on their hands, in my view,” said Frosh.

Pro 2nd Amendment groups hailed the decision and predicted a tidal wave of carry applications.

One Maryland State Police official participating in the Greater Baltimore Committee event said the agency has seen an increase but couldn’t quantify it.

Frosh and others expressed concerns about an increase in violence related to expanded wear and carry laws.

Daniel Webster, a professor and co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said data is incomplete but an upcoming study found not all states “have significant increases in gun violence” when concealed carry laws are relaxed.

Increased training requirements and strict limits on who would be ineligible to get a permit help, he said.

“The higher the bar in essence in order to qualify to get a concealed carry license…you have less, you minimize or even eliminate your elevated risk for gun violence,” said Webster.

“That’s something I think Maryland policymakers really need to concentrate on right now,” he said.

One concerning trend is the increase in violence related to guns stolen from licensed carriers who leave weapons in vehicles and other places.

Webster said lawmakers should be “thinking about storage regulations and public information to encourage safe storage is really important.”",Q3

Johnny Depp 's new collection of artwork that he produced has sold out within hours of going on sale.

The actor, 59, created a limited-edition collection which ""exists at the intersection of 'Pop Art' and 'Street Art'"", according to Castle Fine Art - the seller of his work.

His collection saw 780 pieces go up for sale and the huge interest in the Hollywood actor's work saw the Castle Fine Art website temporarily crash as fans flocked to buy Depp's rare art.

Johnny has been working on the collection called Friends and Heroes over the last few months and included people such as Al Pacino, Bob Dylan, Elizabeth Taylor and Keith Richards in his bold portraits.

Each painting had a value of at least £3,950, while a framed set of four set customers back a whopping £14,950.

Castle Fine Art divulged further into Johnny's fascination in art by creating a blog for the Pirates of the Caribbean actor.

It opened with: ""For Johnny Depp there has always been art. Before acting, and before music, art has always been an important outlet for his creativity.""

Depp has had a roller coaster year following his very public defamation trial in Virginia with his ex-wife Amber Heard before he joined close friend Jeff Beck on tour.

Speaking of his art, Johnny said: ""I’ve always used art to express my feelings and to reflect on those who matter most to me, like my family, friends and people I admire.

""My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves.""

In June, Depp won his legal battle with Heard following a sensational six-week-long trial in the United States.

Depp sued Heard, 36, for defamation over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed she wrote about the alleged domestic violence she suffered, although she did not name her ex-husband.

He demanded more than £38 million, saying her domestic abuse claims have all but ended his career and ruined his reputation.

A jury ruled in favour of the actor, following weeks of testimony from Depp, Heard, friends of the pair, expert witnesses and even supermodel Kate Moss - a former partner of Depp.

He was awarded compensatory damages of $10million (£8million) and a further $5million (£4million) in punitive damages.

Heard filed a countersuit against Depp, seeking almost £78million in damages after claiming his legal team falsely accused her of fabricating claims against the actor.

She was awarded compensatory damages of $2million (£1.6million) after proving one of her counterclaims to the jury.

As Texas Public Radio reported, Beto O’Rourke’s rural Texas push attracts hundreds in deep-red Fredericksburg:

Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic candidate for governor, hopes to court voters in areas that have traditionally voted for conservative politicians. On Wednesday, he brought that hope to Fredericksburg, a Hill Country town northwest of San Antonio. The event attracted more than 800 people. Fredericksburg is the county seat of Gillespie County, which supported former President Donald Trump in 2020 with nearly 80% of its 12,000 ballots cast during the election.

This exchange during one of those events this past week was very touching.

A sobbing father tells @BetoORourke during a rally in Fredericksburg, Texas, that his Republican family will vote for him because he’s taking on the issue of gun violence: “My sons are very tough, but they can’t stop a bullet.” #txlege pic.twitter.com/nSXPSyZpeE — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) August 20, 2022

O'Rourke's visit came just after the entire three person staff at the Gillespie County Elections Department resigned over threats made against the former elections administrator since the 2020 election. Welcome to the new GOP Gestapo America.

O'Rourke addressed the threats during the meeting:

Last Wednesday, the Fredericksburg Standard Radio-Post reported that now-former Elections Administrator Anissa Herrera and her staff had received death threats. “I was threatened, I’ve been stalked, I’ve been called out on social media,” she said. “And it’s just dangerous misinformation.” While speaking in Fredericksburg, O’Rourke compared the alleged threats to attacks on democracy. “If you were one of these folks who cares about our democracy, watching three election workers almost run out of town in Gillespie County for trying to tell the truth and count the votes from a lawfully decided, legitimately voted on election,” he said, “We’re gonna make sure that we get it back – free and fair elections again - in Texas no matter who you want to go for or your political party. We just want to make sure that you can safely and fairly do it.” O’Rourke called for electronic and same-day voter registration: two features Texas does not currently employ. Hannah Thomas, a 24-year-old Fredericksburg resident, described her community as a small town that’s “not-so-conservative anymore.”

Some supporters of Greg Abbott showed up trying to disrupt the event, but it doesn't sound like it went over so well.

Several supporters of Gov. Greg Abbott and Trump gathered outside a pavilion at Lady Bird Johnson Park and played sirens and loud country music with the apparent intent to disrupt the rally. After approaching the opened side doors of the venue, O’Rourke briefly turned his attention to them. “Lest we be annoyed or judge these Abbott people, let’s have a little bit of sympathy,” he said. “Their candidate never shows up to talk to them and listen to what they have to say in Fredericksburg so they had to come to our stuff.” Last week, O’Rourke made national headlines for using a swear word against a heckler in Mineral Wells who laughed while O’Rourke was speaking about the deaths of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde.

Abbott still has a lead over Beto in the polling, but I'm hopeful this means the pollsters are wrong.",Q3

NY Man With Nearly 80 Arrests Busted Twice For Arson

A man, who police say has been arrested nearly 80 times dating back to 1982, made it two more in one week back in April. And yet here he is a free man.

Police say the 66-year-old set fire to a trash can one night at the corner of West 31st Street and Eighth Avenue. And while he was quickly apprehended by authorities, he was soon out of jail. The New York Post says the same public nuisance was right back at it the next morning when he set fire to another trash can.

And soon after, he was out again, says police.

New York Lawmakers Push Back Against Bail Reform

The 2019 Bail Reform has proven to be a controversial subject, as its opponents say it allows repeat offenders to be released only to commit the same crimes again. The new reform went into effect in January 2020 and largely did away with cash bail for many misdemeanor and nonviolent felony charges.

In April 2020, then-Governor. Andrew Cuomo amended the law, that allowed judges to set bail for more crimes. In 2022, more state lawmakers have mounted pressure for a budget deal that would further allow judges to not only set bail for more crimes but to hold repeat offenders pending trial.",Q3

Contra Costa County will continue its effort to rename part of Kirker Pass Road, but only in unincorporated parts of the county and the city of Pittsburg, county officials said Tuesday.

The county’s Board of Supervisors has sought since February to rename the winding road that connects Concord and Pittsburg after local officials learned that James Kirker allegedly killed hundreds of Apache men, women and children in the mid-1800s while working for the state of Chihuahua in Mexico.

That effort recently hit a snag, Supervisor Karen Mitchoff said during the board’s meeting Tuesday, because residents who live along the road within Concord’s city limits opposed having to change their home addresses once the road’s name is changed.

“I did not think there were that many residents whose property affronted Kirker Pass Road,” said Mitchoff, whose district included Clayton, Concord, Pleasant Hill and part of Walnut Creek.

Mitchoff added that she did not initially view the change of address as a significant burden and was “a little irritated” by that reasoning, but has since become more informed.

“It is quite inconvenient,” she said. “It is your driver’s license, it is your medical records, it is your voting records, it is your tax records, it is your property taxes, it’s your children’s school records. And that really would be a burden.”

The county will now seek only to change the name of Kirker Pass Road between the point it exits Concord’s city limits and its junction with Railroad Avenue in the city of Pittsburg, which has expressed an interest in renaming the road.

The city of Clayton has not indicated its support or opposition for the renaming effort, according to the county, but Mitchoff said the county will also abandon Kirker Pass renaming efforts that affect the city.

The roadway does not extend into Clayton, but some properties within the city’s limits do have Kirker Pass Road addresses that would be subject to the potential renaming.

The road is named for James Kirker, who settled in the area of Contra Costa County in 1850 and lived there only until his death in 1852 or 1853. The county officially named the road after Kirker in 1892.

County officials first started considering the name change after Daniel Kelly, a retired San Francisco social worker and a master’s student in Arizona State University’s history program, outlined Kirker’s history as a “homicidal racist.”

After calling on the county to change the road’s name in an op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle, Kelly did the same during the board’s Feb. 8 meeting.

After working as a trapper in what was then northern Mexico and is now southern New Mexico, Kelly argued Kirker became a mercenary of the Mexican government, which was seeking to extract copper ore from the area.

When Apaches in the area attempted to prevent the mining effort and could not be beaten in battle, Kelly said the Mexican government issued bounties of “100 pesos for the scalp of an Apache man, 50 for a woman’s and 25 pesos for a child’s scalp.”

According to Kelly, Kirker and others seeking to claim the government’s bounties raided an Apache camp outside the town of Galeana in the state of Chihuahua in June 1846, bludgeoning between 130 and 170 Apache men, women and children and mounting their scalps on poles outside the camp.

An essay penned by local historian William Mero in the archives of the Contra Costa County Historical Society also portrays Kirker as a mercenary in northern Mexico that worked to defend Mexican mining efforts from raiding indigenous groups including Apaches.

Kirker was “accused by his enemies of leading a band of Apache raiders,” according to Mero, but there is no evidence Kirker personally took scalps.

“Kirker organized militias in many of the villages in Chihuahua State against growing Apache attacks,” Mero wrote. “Later James Kirker led a large band of Mexican, American, Delaware and Shawnee warriors. They fought the Apaches who were raiding deeper and deeper into northern Mexico. Kirker’s band was just one of many such mercenary gangs of American and Mexican Apache scalp hunters working for the State of Chihuahua.”

Supervisor John Gioia argued that the short-term inconvenience of the name change is outweighed by the moral imperative to change the name.

“I think we’re doing the right thing,” he said Tuesday. “And all I can say is I would continue to encourage the cities to make the same change and even over any short-term concern that residents or businesses may have because ultimately, name changes occur at streets all the time.”

A new name for Kirker Pass Road has yet to be proposed, Mitchoff said Tuesday, and will likely be finalized once county officials can hold a community meeting with local residents to take feedback.

Some local residents and county planning officials have also suggested extending the name of Ygnacio Valley Road, which becomes Kirker Pass Road at its intersection with Clayton Road, rather than determining an entirely new name.",Q3

By Kate McGovern in UpRiseRI

When I moved to Providence from New Hampshire a few years ago, I was surprised to find that the legislative process here was much less democratic than what I expected. The process starts out in a typical fashion – bills are introduced and public hearings are conducted by legislative committees, but in the next step, the process diverged.

In the New Hampshire legislature, committees made recommendations on every bill. The committees had several options – they could recommend that the bill be passed as written, passed with an amendment, rejected entirely, or held for further study.

If the members of the committee didn’t agree on a recommendation, summaries of the majority and minority viewpoints were included in the report. The Senate committees sent their reports to the full Senate and House committees to the House.

The reports were published in the chamber’s calendar and votes taken on each bill to approve, defeat, amend, or study. While the committees’ recommendations carried weight, the full body decided whether to accept or alter them.

I was disappointed to find that legislative committees in Rhode Island hold hearings on the same issues year after year without the matter coming before the House or Senate for a vote.

While it would be irresponsible for lawmakers to act without due diligence, some proposals have been in “study” status for years. The sponsors reintroduce them each year. These public hearings are like the movie Ground Hog Day.",Q3

Girls in STEM

MTSU will host the 26th annual Tennessee Girls in STEM Math and Science Conference from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sept. 24 and deadline to register is Thursday, Sept. 1.

The conference — which focuses on science, technology, engineering and math — is for girls in fifth through 12th grade. There is a $20 registration fee, but financial assistance is available. To register and for more details, visit mtsu.edu/TGIS/.

Tennessee Girls in STEM, or TGIS, helps young women investigate science and mathematics careers, hear from women in math and science, participate in hands-on workshops and meet other girls interested in STEM.

Barbara Turnage, interim dean for the College of Behavioral and Health Sciences, will be the keynote speaker. She will discuss “the importance of finding a career that fits their skillset and their interests.”

Key points in her talk will include the difference between a career and a job, balancing work and life, the importance of money to live and not selecting a career because of the money associated with it and more, plus fielding audience questions.

Turnage is a past recipient of the John Pleas Faculty Award, presented to a Black faculty member who has demonstrated excellence in teaching, research and service.

Freecycle

MTSU student Zofia Zagalsky had an eye on one specific item: “I really was wanting the lamp I got to help mitigate some of my electric power usage,” she said following the first-ever Free Cycle event recently on campus.

Throughout July the MTSU community has been in a collection frenzy to bring in new, used and gently used items university students need and can use.

A yard-sale format featuring free “recycled” donations from the campus community and drew 200 students.

“We amassed a mountain of household goods. Everything was free to students,” said Laurie Witherow, associate vice provost for Admissions and Enrollment Services.

It was so popular, Free Cycle is being considered for an annual event.

“They took whatever they could use. We had grateful visitors from every walk of student life come to take advantage of the event. We were amazed and humbled by the outpouring of both volunteers and items collected,"" Witherow said.

There were 20 volunteers from nearly a dozen campus departments who participated in the collection and distribution.

About 50 students also befitted from visiting the MTSU Student Pantry.

Imran Khan responds to SC judgment on deputy speaker ruling.

Khan says he presented “cipher” before then-federal cabinet.

PTI chairman reprimands CEC, says nation will not forgive him.

DG KHAN: PTI Chairman Imran Khan said Thursday he was “hurt” by the Supreme Court’s judgment in the suo motu case of former National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Suri’s ruling, related to the no-confidence motion against the ex-prime minister.

“I was hurt by the Supreme Court’s judgment,” Khan said at a jalsa in Dera Ghazi Khan in connection with the by-election in Punjab on July 17, where he criticised the incumbent government for supporting a US-backed conspiracy against his regime.

In a detailed judgment on the no-confidence ruling, the court noted that no inquiry was ordered into the matter to ascertain the nature or extent of involvement of any person in Pakistan to seek or receive the support of a foreign state to move the no-confidence motion.

""The reservation on the part of the NSC to recommend stronger measures against the alleged foreign conspiracy probably reflects the inadequacy of the material to take more assertive action. This perhaps also explains the lacklustre response by the PCS and the members of the treasury in their respective meeting and sitting of 31.03.2022.""



But an adamant Khan claimed that there was evidence as he said that he presented the “cipher” before the then-federal cabinet, adding that he also has the minutes of the meeting.

Khan asked the courts that when a US undersecretary “threatens” a sitting prime minister of a nation of 220 million people, then isn’t it an embarrassment for the entire country.

The former premier was referring to Donald Lu, the assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, who he claims was behind the alleged conspiracy that led to his government’s ousted in April.

Although the court has maintained that there was insufficient evidence to back Khan’s claim of the foreign conspiracy, the ex-prime minister’s party has termed the SC’s ruling on the no-confidence as “full of errors”.

In a hard-hitting press conference in Lahore today, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said his party would get the verdict quashed by the next “representative and elected assembly”.

Moreover, the federal government has hinted at filing references against the PTI’s top brass after a Supreme Court judgment.

Khan castigates CEC

Apart from criticising the SC's ruling, Khan castigated Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, saying that the nation “would not forgive him” for supporting the incumbent government.

He said that the CEC’s spokesperson has him to back his allegations against Raja. “Why should I respond? You are answerable before me.”

The PTI chairman alleged that he has evidence of the CEC’s meetings with Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shahbaz and PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz.

“Chief election commissioner, why are you taking your team to Lahore? Remember, the nation will not forgive you.”",Q3

SALT LAKE CITY — Michelle Camacho has reached the upper echelons of academia as the new dean at the University of Utah's College of Social and Behavioral Science. But her pathway to higher education looked a bit different than that of many of her colleagues.

Camacho grew up in poverty in Southern California and was the first in her family to attend college. Her parents divorced when she was 5 and her mother struggled to make ends meet. Her mother, who immigrated to the U.S. at a young age from Cochabamba, Bolivia, worked a variety of jobs, ranging from child care and waitressing, to clerical work.

Camacho would often come home to empty cupboards. But her grandparents' house, a short walk from her own, was a refuge.

""There was always music, dancing and cooking,"" Camacho said. ""The characteristics that bring my life a lot of joy, ... those complementary elements of my life, were really formative, I think, to the person that I am today and really helped me kind of get through what were very tough financial years of my childhood and youth.""

Those humble beginnings give Camacho a unique outlook and approach to her new position, where she plans to champion faculty research and advocate for students and faculty who feel like they don't belong. Camacho is the college's first Latina dean; though other colleges at the U. have already reached that milestone.

""I am a college-educated woman with an advanced degree, but my mother speaks very broken English and sees the world through a very different cultural lens than I do,"" Camacho said. ""In a way, I see the world both through her lens and through my own lens.""

""I have always brokered these kinds of territories in a way,"" she added. ""My hometown is the kind of community where there's bars on the windows and a lot of graffiti in the alleys and it's not safe to be out at night. I can go back and that's still my hometown, but then I can step in the very elite space that is a college campus and offer a different source of being welcoming and be a different kind of reference point and a different type of mentor and have connections with people who may feel like they don't necessarily belong, when in fact they just need time and friends and mentors and guides to help them get to the finish line.""

Leading students

Part of Camacho's approach is focusing on the assets students already have and meeting them where they are. Some of their strengths, she said, often go unrecognized or are under-tapped.

It's a phenomenon Camacho saw in her own life as well. Growing up, Camacho didn't have someone at home to check her work. Her grandparents only spoke Spanish and Quechua, an indigenous language in the Andes; and English is her mother's second language. It wasn't until grad school — where she saw how students whose parents had doctorates were able to get feedback and ideas for their dissertations — that she realized that aspect of her upbringing set her apart.

""I think growing up, at times, I didn't see that as a characteristic that would eventually make me stronger or more resilient,"" she said. She hopes to help students from similar backgrounds to see their strengths.

Camacho also raised the possibility of the college becoming a Hispanic-serving institution (where at least 25% of the student population is Hispanic).

Her advice to first-generation students and others who might feel like they don't belong on a college campus comes from lessons she learned while studying high-achieving Latina students for her book, ""The Borderlands of Education: Latinas in Engineering.""

""When you go through those most difficult challenges in your life, you develop this tenacity that can translate into other fields of life and it is that kind of resilience that will carry you through the hardest things,"" she said. ""Be compassionate with yourself and know that you are not always going to be successful.""

Supporting faculty

One of Camacho's goals as dean is to further elevate faculty research, especially as it pertains to solving societal problems like environmental injustices and racial inequities.

""Those are all the kinds of issues that social and behavioral scientists grapple with daily in their work,"" she said. ""Sometimes there are really excellent ideas and initiatives, but there needs to be someone who is willing to champion those ideas and who's willing to provide an intellectual argument about why it's important to create mechanisms for change around issues of equity, diversity and inclusion.""

Camacho also researches student-veteran populations and hopes to fortify pathways for their success in partnership with Salt Lake Community College, saying student-veterans need advocacy.

Her training as a cultural anthropologist and sociologist also helps her prioritize listening to and learning from the community.

""I'm not coming in with a top-down direction that I want to take the college in, but rather, I'm really trying to understand where faculty are now and where we want to move forward together,"" she said.

From California to Utah

Although Camacho spent the majority of her life Southern California, coming to the University of Utah was far from her first time in Utah. A national parks enthusiast, Camacho has been to many of Utah's parks, including a seven-year streak of spending each Thanksgiving at Zion.

""I am still getting used to Salt Lake City and to the state of Utah, but I have found so much peace in the beauty of the landscape,"" Camacho said. ""There is so much beauty still to be discovered and the possibility of developing new companions and colleagues and friends in the context of this beautiful state is something that I'm really looking forward to.""

Her career has included developing the Ethnic Studies courses and programming at the University of San Diego; authoring multiple books and journal articles about diversity in higher education; and, building an initiative to increase the number of women STEM faculty at USD.

Camacho began her teaching career in 1994 as a graduate student, before earning a doctorate in social science. During the next decade of her career, Camacho advanced through the academic ranks to a tenured professor at University of San Diego, serving in multiple administrative roles along the way.

There were a handful of experiences, however, that she pointed to as catalysts for her decision to move to Utah. One was a completing a yearlong fellowship with the American Council on Education, which helps prepare faculty for leadership positions in higher education.

""That year of service really helped me distill my values — so what type of institution do I think I can best serve at? Under what conditions, for whom and why?"" she said. ""The 'why' piece of it was really important for me,"" she said, adding that because some institutions are shrinking so there is ""not that much room for growth or innovation.""

Camacho had just finished a rotation as acting deputy division director at the National Science Foundation's Division of Education and Human Resources when she was nominated for her current position at the U. It seemed like timing was on the U.'s side. Camacho's father passed away after a chronic illness and the last of her three children graduated high school earlier this year.

She had an empty nest, but more important, she felt like she could make a difference in Utah.

""There's really an opportunity for me to advance the work that I've been doing in terms of advocating for faculty research across the country and supporting student success, which has been a top priority for me,"" Camacho said. ""The importance of education as a factor in promoting social mobility is so close to my own trajectory and my own story of growing up in poverty and being able to finish college and then go on to graduate school.

""For me, it's been so powerful to see how education has been an important catalyst in just changing the circumstances of my life.""

PEA RIDGE, Ark. — On Aug. 14, 2022, the Benton County Sheriff’s Office began a search for a missing 49-year-old woman accused of murdering her husband.

Dawn Rene Wynn was reportedly last seen in the area of Jennifer Lane in Pea Ridge. She is 5 foot 2 inches tall, weighs between 150 and 170 pounds and has short black hair.

Officials believed she headed to northeastern Oklahoma but said she also had ties in southwestern Missouri.

According to court records in McDonald County, Missouri, Wynn was out of jail on a $100,000 bond pending her hearings on a case where she faces charges of 2nd-degree murder and armed criminal action. According to the McDonald County Sheriff's Office (MCSO), the case stems from the shooting of her husband in November of 2021.

Court records show she pleaded not guilty on June 16, 2022, and she was scheduled for a pre-trial conference in this case on Sept. 15, 2022.

Wynn's bond was revoked on Aug. 14 and a warrant was issued for her arrest. According to the McDonald County Circuit Court, the warrant was issued because she ""violated conditions of release by failing to report to pre-trial services.""

The MCSO wrote the following statement on Facebook:

""Please be on the lookout for Dawn Wynn. Due to a recent Missouri Supreme Court ruling, over objections from the prosecuting attorney, Wynn was out on bond and on pre-trial release where she had to check in by telephone. She is accused of murder and armed criminal action stemming from the shooting of her husband. She should be considered dangerous and could be armed. She is accused of, and charged with shooting her husband in the back of the head while he slept. If you have any information regarding her whereabouts, please call the McDonald County Sheriff’s Office at 417-223-4318 or your local law enforcement agency. Exercise caution and do not approach!""

On Oct. 24, the McDonald County Sheriff's Office shared on its Facebook that Dawn Wynn had been located in Indiana.

""We're happy to report that Dawn Wynn is in custody. Earlier this afternoon, we were contacted by authorities in Indiana. Wynn had been recognized from television coverage and the alert citizen reported her to the local authorities. Thank you to our Indiana brothers and sisters in blue for a job well done!""

Some people claim 2020 was the ""worst year ever."" There was even a Netflix movie made about it. While we can't say definitively that this is true -- none of us were alive in the 1300s during the Black Plague, for example -- it's certainly true that you don't meet too many 2020 ""enthusiasts.""

Now, if you happened to be a virus that went by the name COVID-19, then yeah, 2020 was a great year. You killed 337,000 Americans, and over 1.5 million people worldwide. But despite what your ex might think, you're probably not a virus. You're a person.

But people weren't much better to people in 2020. It was also the worst case for murder in New York state.

According to the website 24/7 Wall St, there were 21,570 murders reported in the United States in 2020. Which is... quite a few. Here's what they said about their study:

Using FBI homicide rate data from 2011 through 2020, 24/7 Wall St. identified the deadliest year in each state in the last decade. Over that period, 2020 stands out as the year with the highest homicide rate in 37 states... Nationwide, the number of reported murders increased by 47% from 2011 to 2020.

New York was no exception to this. Here's how the data breaks down:

NEW YORK

• Deadliest year: 2020; 4.2 murders per 100,000 people (808 total)

• Second deadliest year: 2011; 3.9 murders per 100,000 people (769 total)

• Least deadly year: 2017; 2.8 murders per 100,000 people (550 total)

SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?

Experts agree that not murdering someone is the best way to prevent murder. So if we all agree to do our part, we might be able to get these numbers down in New York moving forward.

https://www.sunjournal.com/2022/07/31/chapter-11-lizzies-mother-pays-a-visit/,Chapter 11: Lizzie’s mother pays a visit,"When the afternoon train from Bangor arrived in Lewiston shortly before 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 1873, two members of the missing Mary Elizabeth “Lizzie” Lowell’s family were among the passengers who got off.

City Marshal H.H. Richardson met Sarah Elizabeth Burton, mother of the missing Lizzie, and Georgia Burton, 17, Lizzie’s younger sister, at the station. They asked to be taken to the home of Lydia Blethen, an old friend of the Burtons, but were instead assigned a room at the DeWitt House, a downtown hotel, where they could be kept in seclusion until their testimony at the inquest.

Yet that’s not where Richardson took them. He brought them instead to the jail in the basement of the City Building.

Richardson testified later that Sarah Burton asked to see James M. “Jim” Lowell and that he had “been advised” to let her. Nobody asked who gave him that advice, but since Androscoggin County Attorney George Wing was handling the investigation, it is a reasonable guess he made the decision to allow the visit.

In any case, Richardson escorted the two Burtons to Lowell’s cell and unlocked its door.

“I have got some company for you,” he told the prisoner. “Your mother and sister-in-law have come to see you.”

Richardson swung the door open and the two women entered the cell.

Sitting to the side in a chair, Lowell “did not get up or look up” when they arrived, Richardson said.

“How do you do, Jim?” Sarah Burton asked.

Then Lowell asked her how she was doing.

All the while, Richardson stood at the door to the cell, holding in his right hand the remnants of the black dress found with the skeleton in the woods almost a week earlier.

“Jim, did you ever see this dress before?” Richardson asked with the women present.

Without ever raising his eyes to see it , Lowell responded, “No.”

“Jim, that is Lizzie’s dress, and you know it is,” Richardson said.

Lowell again said it was not, adding that “Lizzie’s had fringe on it.”

“Jim, you don’t know what is on this dress,” the city marshal said. “You don’t know whether it is fringe, or what it is.”

Describing the scene later, Richardson said, “During all this time, he was sitting, looking on the floor; never looked up to me or the dress; neither was he looking at Miss or Mrs. Burton.”

Sarah Burton said she, too, never saw Lowell look up.

Richardson said that both Burtons then spoke briefly to Lowell.

“You know that’s her dress,” Lizzie’s sister said to Lowell.

The missing woman’s mother asked her son-in-law, “Why don’t you tell us where Lizzie is?”

“Because I don’t know where she is,” Lowell answered, never taking his eyes off the floor.

Lizzie’s mother said she made some sort of comment about Lowell “making away with her” and he told her that he had not.

The Lewiston Evening Journal said at the time the meeting “was evidently not a pleasant one for the prisoner. He was a good deal agitated when the silk dress was carried in with them, was shown to him for the first time.”

“Whether innocent or guilty,” the paper said, “such an ordeal as this visit could hardly have been coolly borne, as the mother and daughter showed signs of great mental distress.”

Their day, exhausting as it must have been by that time, was not yet over.

All the while, every scrap of information was mulled and discussed.

“The skeleton mystery is the absorbing theme of conversation in our midst, and the desire to unravel the mystery, is as natural as it is universal,” the Journal said.

It cautioned people “to suspend judgment in the case” until the sworn testimony was finished “and all possible light thrown upon the mystery.”

Lowell meanwhile expressed the hope that perhaps William Frye, a former Maine attorney general from Lewiston who had moved on to a U.S. House seat, might be willing to defend him in court.

Frye visited Lowell in jail to tell him he couldn’t spare the time.

He emerged from the City Building to declare that Lowell “appeared well” and struck him as “very calm and composed.”

Frye said he had no opinion about Lowell’s guilt or innocence.

After dinner that Tuesday, the two women, dressed in black, sat in the jury room beside the city marshal’s office. They cried as Coroner Ham Brooks described the skeleton he saw a week earlier in a copse off the Switzerland Road, the bones of a young woman with her kneecaps nearly fused together in the dirt where they lay.

They had no doubt those bones were all that was left of Lizzie.

Called to the stand, Sarah Burton, a widow from a small town near Bangor, told the six men forming the coroner’s inquest that Lizzie disappeared in June 1870, though she only learned her daughter had vanished when a friend wrote to her that summer.

Burton said she’d seen the remnants of a black dress her daughter owned that had been found with the bones. Its lace trimming, she said, was so unusual that she was sure Lizzie and her other daughters used all there was of it.

Lizzie’s mother proceeded to suggest that her son-in-law was the likely killer.

“My daughter and Lowell did not live pleasantly together,” she said. “He appeared to be jealous of her and everything else.”

“I saw him whip my daughter often” when she stayed with them at their home on College Street, Burton said.

Once, she said, he hollered, “By God, I’ll kill you” at Lizzie as he whipped her.

That was two years before she went missing, Burton said.

It didn’t get any better for her daughter after that, she said.

After her daughter’s disappearance, Burton said she came to Lewiston and collected some things that Lizzie left behind at a boarding house.

She spotted Lowell at Harlow’s shoe store, she said, and greeted him.

“It’s no place to talk here,” he told her. “Let’s go down the street.”

Burton said she asked him, “Where’s Liz?”

Lowell answered that she was in Lawrence, Massachusetts, working. He told her he’d learned of her whereabouts from somebody named Charley.

Georgia had heard enough.

“Don’t let’s go with a murderer,” her mother recalled Georgia telling her that day in Lewiston.

With that, she said, “Lowell went off and left us, going in a direction opposite of where he had left his team” of horses.

“That is all the conversation I ever had with him,” Burton said.

Georgia, who worked in one of the mills in 1870, told the men gathered for the inquest that her mother’s memory matched her own.

A little after 8 p.m., the coroner’s jury began talking about the evidence. Three hours later, it had agreed on a verdict.

It ruled that, in its view, the remains found in the woods were those of the missing woman and that Lizzie “came to her death by violence three years ago last June, at the hands of some person or persons unknown to said jurors.”

Officials said they planned to arraign Lowell for murder in the Lewiston Police Courtroom on Thursday morning.

After the alleged assault, the 18-year-old woman reported the attack to the Stamford Police Department, said Lt. Tom Scanlon of the Stamford Police Department.

""Stamford Major Crime investigators immediately began working the case and quickly developed evidence that allowed for the identification of both suspects and the vehicle used in the crime,"" Scanlon said.

Arrest warrants were presented to the Stamford State’s Attorney’s Office and granted for the suspects: Arnold Olivos-Cruzado, 25, and Poul Isidro, 37, addresses unknown, he said.

Stamford investigators began working with the NY FBI Safe Streets Task Force as intelligence indicated one suspect had fled from the area.

On Friday, Aug. 5, Isidro was located and arrested by authorities in Cobb County, Georgia. Isidro was in possession of the vehicle used in the crime and it was seized as evidence, he added.

Isidro was held as a fugitive from justice pending extradition.

On Saturday, Aug. 6, investigators tracked the second suspect to a location on the west side of Stamford. Olivos was located and arrested without incident, Scanlon said.

On Wednesday, Aug. 17, investigators flew to Georgia and continued the investigation. A search warrant was obtained and investigators then processed the vehicle used in this crime, police said.

Isidro had previously waived extradition and he was taken into custody and transported to Stamford on Thursday, Aug. 18.

Olivos and Isidro were charged with:

Sexual assault

Conspiracy to commit sexual assault

Unlawful restraint

Each is being held on a $1 million dollar court set bond.

Hood County lifted the order Tuesday night, hours after it was issued for a rural area south of Tolar due to the Chalk Mountain Fire.

Texas A&M Forest Services said the Chalk Mountain Fire has burned about nine square miles, destroyed at least a dozen structures and is about 10% contained. It was not clear how many of the structures were homes, Forest Services spokesperson Mary Leathers said.

Another fire at Possum Kingdom Lake has burned about 500 acres and at least five homes. No injuries have been reported. The National Weather Service issued a fire warning and excessive heat warnings for northern and central Texas and western and eastern Oklahoma for Wednesday.

County emergency management officials did not immediately return a phone call for comment early Wednesday.

No injuries have been reported as a result of either fire.

A combination of near-record and record temperatures approaching 110 degrees combined with breezes gusting as high as 30 mph and drought conditions leave the region ripe for fire, the forest service said.

Four other smaller fires remain active in Bosque County, Kaufman County and Lamar County.

https://www.superiortelegram.com/newsmd/fda-begins-deliberations-on-menthol-cigarette-ban,FDA begins deliberations on menthol cigarette ban,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — The director of the Mayo Clinic nicotine dependence center says the proposed Food and Drug Administration plan to ban menthol cigarettes now under final review ""would probably save hundreds of thousands of lives over the next three or four decades.""

""The FDA is moving to eliminate menthol in tobacco,"" said Dr. J. Taylor Hays during a media call on Monday, Aug. 1. ""It is long in coming, and I think it is the right move for public health.""

ADVERTISEMENT

Menthol cigarettes are manufactured when peppermint flavoring is added to some brands as a means to reduce throat irritation and harshness. It is known to increase adoption of smoking among young people.

""It provides a local anesthetic, if you will, a cooling effect,"" Hays said. ""That reduces irritability and the cough reflex and, frankly, makes it easier to smoke what otherwise would be a very harsh smoke ... making it easier to start, easier to continue, and quicker to get hooked, because it increases your nicotine exposure.""

Modeling studies show eliminating menthol cigarettes would result in 15% fewer smokers within 40 years, a drop resulting in between 324,000 and 654,000 fewer deaths during that time period. The proposed ban would include all flavored cigars as well.

A ban has been a long time in the works.

Menthol has been added to cigarettes for over a hundred years but the practice increased in the 1950s. In 2009 the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act prohibited all other flavors in cigarettes, but excluded tobacco and menthol flavoring.

The current proposal did not gain traction until a 2013 lawsuit sought to ban menthol in tobacco, Hays said. With the passage on Monday of a comment submission deadline, a final review period has begun. The FDA has given no timeline for when they will render their decision.

Menthol cigarettes are used by 18.5 million Americans, according to federal officials, and are purchased by 85% of non-Hispanic Black smokers, compared to 30% of white smokers. Following a ban, between 92,000 and 238,000 fewer Black Americans are expected to die of smoking-related illness over the ensuing decades, according to federal research.

ADVERTISEMENT

Though some Black leaders have opposed the ban as discriminatory, it is hailed by others as a correction to years of menthol cigarette marketing targeting Black Americans.

""I don't think there's anything about menthol and menthol containing tobacco that would be particularly attracting African Americans, other than the tobacco industry is targeting them in their marketing,"" Hays said.

""And that's been shown in a number of empirical studies looking at point-of-sale and price point marketing of menthol-containing cigarettes to the African American community.""

Health officials say the change will not result in action at the individual level, stating that the agency ""cannot and will not enforce against individual consumers for possession or use of menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars.""

""State and local law enforcement agencies do not independently enforce the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and do not, and cannot, take enforcement actions against any violation of FDA’s tobacco authorities,"" the FDA statement said.

It is an important concession for those concerned that, in outlawing the cigarette overwhelmingly favored by Black Americans, the change could increase potentially perilous contacts between users of black market menthol products and law enforcement. In 2014, a New York man named Eric Garner was killed by Staten Island police after they approached him for selling loose cigarettes.

""I know this has been an argument,"" Hays said. ""It seems ironic that a predatory industry like the tobacco industry can market in this way and then we say we can't take the step to eliminate this product that we know is causing dependence among a large number of African American youth and adults, because we’re concerned about the way it will be enforced.""

""I do understand that in the current atmosphere, that's an issue, [but] the enforcement is not against individuals ... the enforcement is at the production level. If there is a black market, it will only happen because the tobacco industry is cooperative.""",Q3

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10983053/Pakistani-doctor-cleared-misconduct-using-clumsy-misguided-language.html,Pakistani doctor cleared of misconduct after using 'clumsy and misguided' language,"A Pakistani doctor who commented about 'white folk' and referred to female work colleagues as 'beautiful things' has been cleared of wrongdoing after a tribunal accepted he had been using 'clumsy and misguided' language.

Dr Siddick Dulloo, 69, was accused of making sexually suggestive remarks after he compared one doctor and a nurse to the 'sun and moon in an eclipse,' adding: 'I am just jealous I couldn't come in the middle - I wish I was a sister or a nurse so I could have joined you.'

In another incident on a ward at North Manchester General Hospital, Dr Dulloo an associate specialist in renal medicine spoke in Urdu about 'white folk spending thousands of pounds going abroad to look at beautiful things', before continuing in English: 'I was thinking they could just spend £2 and come to North Manchester Hospital.'

The 'beautiful things' at the hospital appeared to be a reference to an interaction between two female colleagues, which Dr Dulloo said made him 'jealous I couldn't come in the middle'.

Dr Dulloo, originally from Karachi, was later reported to NHS managers by staff who also accused him of making 'grunting' and 'groaning' noises whilst making his remarks. They also claimed he had taken an illicit picture of one female colleague on his mobile phone and said he would make them 'uncomfortable' during encounters.

At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, Dr Dulloo of Prestwich, Manchester, who has since retired from medical practice, faced professional ruin after being accused of sexually motivated misconduct but he was cleared following a disciplinary hearing.

He accepted his remarks were 'inappropriate' but blamed his command of the English language and said he was merely trying to make conversation regarding the eclipse as he had heard a news story on the topic that morning.

The panel said the grunting and groaning noises may have come about due to the doctor speaking in a 'low tonal voice' and concluded he had 'accidentally' taken the mobile phone picture whilst swiping a screen on his phone to speak to his builder.

The hearing was told the incidents occurred when Dr Dulloo – who qualified in 1983 – was working on Ward 5 of the hospital in July 2019.

One medic known as Dr A said that Dr Dulloo told her: 'Oh you're making me jealous; I want to get in the middle of that, I wish I was a nurse or sister so I could join in', before making a groaning noise.

Two days later it was alleged he began speaking to Dr A in Urdu saying: 'Oh you know these white folk, they spend thousands of pounds going abroad to look at beautiful things', then continued in English: 'I was saying, these white (folk) spend so much money going to Philippines or Thailand, but I was thinking they could just spend £2 and come to North Manchester Hospital.'

Dr Dulloo told a female colleague: 'I was saying, these white (folk) spend so much money going to Philippines or Thailand, but I was thinking they could just spend £2 and come to North Manchester Hospital'

He went on: 'Did you see there was an eclipse on Wednesday? You don't need to go abroad for that, I saw the eclipse here on this ward, the sun and the moon were hugging here, I am just jealous I couldn't come in the middle, I wish I was a sister or a nurse so I could have joined you.'

Boyd Morwood, counsel for the General Medical Council, said: 'The comments were not work related, came from a senior doctor to two junior members of staff, were made in close proximity to patients and other colleagues.

'They made both individuals feel uncomfortable and were of a physical and overly personal nature.

'Dr Dulloo's conduct was distasteful, inappropriate and caused Dr A an ""adverse reaction"". The use of the word ""white"" may have been racially motivated or offensive to specific racial group.'

But Dr Dulloo's counsel Christopher Gillespie said: 'Whilst he made clumsy comments which plainly upset Dr A, his actions lack the seriousness that is being portrayed.

'Although Dr Dulloo's comments were indeed misguided, there was no attempt to demean or abuse his position.

'It was merely a misguided comment which was not received in the manner in which it was intended. He made some regrettable comments but it was certainly not Dr Dulloo's intention to treat his colleagues with disrespect.'

In clearing Dr Dulloo of serious professional misconduct MPTS chairman Nicholas Flanagan said: 'English was not Dr Dulloo's first language and he may have expressed himself in a clumsy and inappropriate fashion.

'But there was very little evidence that demonstrated that Dr Dulloo had any particular sexual interest in Dr A.

'No overtly sexual words were used, the comments were not lewd or vulgar and, whilst inappropriate, there was no reason to conclude that they would provide any sexual gratification for Dr Dulloo.

'During his oral evidence, Dr Dulloo spoke with a low tonal sound, mumbled on occasion and frequently said ""erm"". He also had a tendency to repeat himself.

'If one were not familiar with Dr Dulloo's delivery, some of these sounds could be misconstrued as a groaning noise.

'It was highly possible that Dr Dulloo made a groaning or grunting noise in his interaction with Dr A and Ms E, which may have been misconstrued as inappropriate.'

Referring to the mobile phone incident, Mr Flanagan added: 'Dr Dulloo stated he was eagerly awaiting an important phone call from his builder regarding some business in his personal life.

'Dr Dulloo's evidence is that when he tried to answer an incoming phone call, he swiped up on his phone, accidently opening the camera and inadvertently taking a photograph of what was in front of him.

'Dr Dulloo's evidence is that he did not realise he had taken a photograph until he was confronted and asked to open his photo gallery.

'Dr Dulloo has eyesight problems and wears glasses, which he said he was not wearing at the time. He is not adept at using his phone and is not a particularly technological person.

'If Dr Dulloo had been acting in a predatory manner in trying to take a photograph of Dr A for his own sexual gratification, he would have likely been far more clandestine in his actions, such as turning his phone to silent mode so it did not make a loud clicking noise, or waiting until he and Dr A were alone and holding his phone in a more discrete position.

'These incidents were isolated in the context of an otherwise unblemished career, that Dr Dulloo has made admissions, expressed an apology and shown insight into his shortcomings.

'Dr Dulloo has retired, does not hold a licence to practise and does not intend to return to the workplace. Issuing a warning in this case would have little useful impact.'",Q3

A new state law banning “explicit sexual material” — defined as any visual depiction of sex acts or genitalia, with exceptions for artistic or scientific significance — went into effect at the end of August and applies to both public and private schools.

Teachers and librarians have scoured their book lists for any applicable content at the direction of lawyers. But interpretation of the law varies by geography, according to a Post-Dispatch analysis of public records:

• Ten school districts in St. Louis city and mostly inner suburbs plan to ignore the law and not change their library collections. University City posted a photo this week of banned books displayed in the middle school library along with a sign reading “We Read Banned Books.”

• Four suburban districts — Francis Howell in St. Charles County and Kirkwood, Lindbergh and Rockwood in St. Louis County — each removed more than 12 books from their schools.

• Wentzville School District banned one book and pulled 223 others “for further review,” including dozens of art history books and “Children’s Bible Stories.”

• Two Jefferson County districts, Fox and Festus, banned no books. A Festus spokesman clarified that materials falling under the law “were never in school libraries in the first place.”

The number of book bans nationwide this school year is on track to top last year’s record total, according to the American Library Association. The spike comes amid a culture war over how educators should teach about race, gender and sexuality.

“When you dictate what people can read, what people can choose from, that’s the mark of an authoritarian society, not a democratic society,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the association’s office for intellectual freedom. “We really have to question what we intend for the education of our young people.”

The local map of banned books tends to align with political leanings, with districts in conservative areas removing more titles. Suburban school boards in St. Charles County and west St. Louis County have also faced repeated book challenges from residents over the last two years.

The three books most frequently targeted were “The Handmaid’s Tale” graphic novel, banned in 10 local school districts; “Gender Queer,” banned in seven districts and “Watchmen,” banned in four districts. Half of the 10 books most frequently pulled from classrooms and school libraries feature LGBTQ characters and themes, and several others involve racism.

Of the 97 books that have been banned by schools in the St. Louis area, 86 were targeted by just one district. High-profile examples include:

• Ritenour School District banned “Maus” by Art Spiegelman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust that depicts Jews as mice and Nazis as cats. When “Maus” was banned earlier this year by a Tennessee school district, the U.S. Holocaust Museum said the book “has played a vital role in educating about the Holocaust through sharing detailed and personal experiences of victims and survivors.”

• Lindbergh banned “A Dangerous Woman: The Graphic Biography of Emma Goldman,” about the radical political activist and anarchist, along with several volumes in the “Game of Thrones” and “The Walking Dead” series.

• In addition to “1984: The Graphic Novel,” Kirkwood banned “Crime and Punishment: A Graphic Novel,” “Annie Leibovitz at Work” about the celebrity photographer, and “The Human Body in Action,” a 1999 textbook with a chapter called “Making Babies.”

The ACLU of Missouri issued a statement last month saying school library books are not subject to the new state law because they have “already been screened under nationally well-established standards for selecting material that take into account the entire piece.”

But some school leaders said the threat of prosecution requires a conservative approach to culling books.

“The unfortunate reality of Senate Bill 775 is that, now in effect, it includes criminal penalties for individual educators. We are not willing to risk those potential consequences and will err on the side of caution on behalf of the individuals who serve our students,” said Kirkwood spokeswoman Steph Deidrick.

The Missouri Library Association denounced the book bans, saying schools need to protect academic freedom for their students and autonomy for their educators.

“In choosing to preemptively remove graphic novels from your collection, you are sending the message to your students that you support (the law’s) intent, which is to chill access to information, art, and culturally relevant materials in your collection,” reads a Sept. 9 letter from the association to Rockwood administrators. “We ask you as leaders in your district to have courage in the face of this law, to support your staff and your students, and to stand with us against censorship.”

The bill’s sponsor state Sen. Rick Brattin, R-Harrisonville, tweeted this month that he is “proud to have banned these books in school libraries. It’s sick that people think this is appropriate for school age children.”

Students react to book bans

No private schools have reported pulling books in response to the law. High school students in an AP Literature course at Crossroads College Prep in St. Louis described the book bans as patronizing, insulting and disturbing.

“Banning these books weaves another layer onto this blanket of ignorance,” said Tré Humphries, 17.

In a recent class, Crossroads students discussed “Invisible Man” by Ralph Ellison and other books that have been banned. English teacher and co-head of school Sarah Pierson Wolff said a lawyer for Crossroads has advised administrators about the new state law, but that no books have been removed.

“The idea of trying to limit what people have access to is something we are fighting against,” Wolff said. “For somebody to say a book is dangerous is scary.”

Book bans are also known to backfire, inspiring students to seek out books that otherwise would sit untouched on the library shelf.

“The fact is, if you’re an enterprising teenager and you want a copy of ‘Gender Queer’ you’re going to get it,” said Linda Johnson, president and CEO of the Brooklyn Public Library in New York. “Either the elected officials or parents or school administrators are naïve or there’s something else at play.”

In April, the library launched Books Unbanned, offering free online access to its entire collection for 13- to 21-year-olds. There have been spikes in demand from students living in school districts that banned titles, Johnson said.

Families in Wentzville, where the school district is being sued over book bans, will partner with the ACLU to host a “students’ rights” strategy session on Oct. 2 at the local library.

“It’s important for students to learn how to advocate for themselves,” said Zebrina Looney, whose four children attended Wentzville schools. “They’re the ones going off to college and potentially not equipped with the knowledge that their counterparts had.”

Graphic novels targeted

Jerry Craft hated reading as a kid and thinks it’s because the African American protagonists were either enslaved, imprisoned or fighting for civil rights.

“As a 12-year-old, why couldn’t I have a Harry Potter?” Craft said. “I write the books I wish I had when I was a kid. Kids just want to be seen.”

When Craft heard his book “New Kid” had been challenged by parents in Texas because of “critical race theory,” he had to Google the term. The Newbery Award-winning graphic novel is about a Black boy who experiences culture shock when he transfers to a private school.

“My goal was to tell a story that was loosely based on my life and the lives of my two sons and the lives of a bunch of my friends,” said Craft, who spoke about banned comic books Thursday at St. Louis Central Library. “One of the things that most people don’t do is actually read the book or ask a kid what they think of the book. That’s one of the biggest problems — the kids are often an afterthought.”

Teachers say graphic novels are valuable tools for engaging reluctant readers, English learners and those with learning disabilities. The visuals combined with text can lead to deeper understanding and analysis of a book.

But there is a general misunderstanding of the term graphic novel, which refers to the comic-strip illustrated format of the books and not the content, said Jeff Trexler, interim director of the New York-based Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.

Federal lawmakers on Thursday marked Banned Books Week by introducing resolutions condemning school book bans, calling them unconstitutional.

“The general tragedy of banning books in schools is they are protected classes against discrimination,” Trexler said. “You’re going to have people thrown into jail for showing material that’s protected by the First Amendment.”

L.A. Unified’s latest state test scores reveal dramatic decreases in student performance — and an even more striking decline for some ethnic groups and vulnerable students.

The outcomes of the 2022 Smarter Balanced assessment showed just 28.47% of LAUSD students met state standards in math, while 41.67% met English standards in the 2021-22 school year — declines of two and five percentage points respectively from the 2018-19 school year.

For Latino, low-income, Black, female, and other student groups, the declines were often greater — which was no surprise, said LAUSD superintendent Alberto Carvalho.

“Kids who were at risk, in a fragile condition, prior to the pandemic, as we expected, were the ones who have lost the most ground,” said Carvalho at a news conference. “Five years of gradual academic progress … have been reversed.”

Here are highlights from the data:

1. While all students’ test scores declined, the downward trends were greater among Latino, low income, and Black students:

The change from the 2018-019 school year to the 2021-22 school year on the English assessment for third graders was the largest among Latino and low-income students. While third graders’ scores on the English test declined 14 percentage points overall, for third grade Latino students, the drop was 18.38 percentage points; and more than 16 percentage points for low income students.

Latino and low-income students in third through fifth grade also demonstrated among the greatest change in performance from the 2018-19 school year to the 2021-22 school year in math. In those grades, Latino students’ scores declined 17.63 percentage points, while low-income students dropped 16.41%. Overall in grades 3-5, the decline was 14.24 percentage points.

The results of the sixth through eighth graders’ math scores show that Black students

exhibited the greatest change in performance, with a 16.42 percentage point decline, followed by Latino students at 15.81 percentage points and low-income students at 15.73 percentage points.

“It’s not surprising that they would have fared worse during the pandemic because of all the disadvantages they face,” said Pedro A. Noguera, dean of the Rossier School of Education at USC. “We could have predicted what we are seeing now.”

2. Females had greater declines on the math exam compared to males, a change from prior to the pandemic — and one of the largest declines in English scores:

While L.A. Unified female students have consistently performed better on the English assessments, the 2021-22 school year marked a dramatic change.

Females were among the groups that lost the most ground on reading assessments, with a 2.76 percentage point decline from the 2018-19 school year, compared to a 1.67 percentage point decline for males. Up until last school year, females routinely outperformed males in the pre pandemic years: In 2018-19, 48.84% of females met the English standards, compared to 39.19% of males.

“That is an anomaly, for over the past years, female students have actually been outperforming male students in math and science courses,” Carvalho said. “This is a regression that merits deep, deep analysis and research.”

Post-pandemic, male students earned a higher percentage in math state standards compared to females. Nearly 30% of male students met or exceeded math state standards while just over 27% of females did.

3. From 2018-19 to 2021-22, 11th graders showed a significantly larger decline on the assessments

In English, 11th graders showed the biggest drop in performance with a decrease of 7.10 percentage points compared to a decrease of 4.55 percentage points in grade three and 3.98 percentage points in grade 4.

Grade 11 also saw the greatest decline in math with a high of 9.73 percentage points away from state standards compared to 5.83 percentage points in grade eight and 5.73 percentage points in grade six.

4. Low-income students continue to underperform on state tests, with the gap between low-income and non low-income students increasing:

Recent scores in English show 35.71% of low-income students met or exceeded standards while 65.65% of non low-income students did — highlighting the growing divide between students according to socioeconomic status.

In math, 22.5% of low-income students met or exceeded state standards on math tests while 51.91% of non low-income students met or exceeded standards.

Noguera said a lack of reliable internet, access to a device, and support at home were the main drivers contributing to poor performance from low-income students.

“The general pattern in America is poor kids do less well than affluent kids and that’s because we spend less to educate the poor kids,” Noguera said. “They have less qualified teachers, they go to schools with fewer resources, and that’s true in L.A. just as it is across the country.”

(KRDO) -- Police arrested a man with multiple warrants regarding probation violations out of El Paso County in connection to a deadly shooting in Denver.

According to the Denver Police Department (DPD), 32-year-old Alejandro Blanco, a Cuban national from El Paso County, was arrested on July 29, 2022, for the murder of 41-year-old Sergio Ordonez-Valencia.

Alejandro Blanco

According to court documents, a witness told investigators that Blanco said to a group of four men sitting at a picnic table at Elyria Park in Denver ""I'm going to kill all of you,"" on July 20, 2022. He's accused of then firing two shots into the group and hitting Ordonez-Valencia in the neck, killing him.

At the time of this shooting, 13 Investigates learned that Blanco was serving 18-month probation and 30-month community corrections sentences. In 2020, he plead guilty to aggravated motor vehicle theft in El Paso County and was sentenced in September 2021.

Since Blanco's sentencing, a Colorado Springs probation officer has filed three separate probation revocation complaints alleging that he was violating the conditions of probation. Those complaints were filed in an El Paso County courtroom on February 24, April 15, and June 2 of this year.

""When you have a probation revocation, you have the right to a hearing within 14 days,"" Colorado Springs attorney Jeremy Loew explained.

According to court documents, Blanco was given these hearings but failed to appear in court on April 1, and July 21. Blanco was eventually detained on failure to appear warrants on March 12 and again on May 28.

Following being detailed on March 12, court documents indicate that El Paso County Judge Frances Renae Johnson gave Blanco a $2,000 surety bond.

It's unclear the terms of his release following his May 28 detainment. 13 Investigates is actively seeking answers surrounding that incident.

""The judge was likely letting him out. New probation complaints were being filed. He obviously wasn't taking probation seriously. He wasn't taking community corrections seriously,"" Loew said. ""Now we are in a situation where he's killed somebody.""

Loew acknowledged that not everyone on a probationary or community corrections sentence is likely to be charged with murder.

""However, this is clearly someone who was a bad apple and as a result of that, we are now faced with a much more serious crime,"" Loew said.

13 Investigates reached out to the El Paso County courts for information on Blanco's warrants and releases from jail. They said they cannot comment on pending cases.

The 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office told 13 Investigates they objected to a personal recognizance bond, or bond with no monetary backing when Blanco was detained. They issued this statement saying:",Q3

COLUMBUS, Ohio — A 26-year-old man is charged with murder after court records state he admitted to his role in the fatal shooting of a 38-year-old man in the Linden area last month.

Devon Robinson, who was first identified as a person of interest, turned himself in to the Columbus Division of Police Tuesday on a warrant for a parole violation, according to Franklin County Municipal Court records. During an interview with detectives, he admitted to his role in the shooting death of Mario Copeland on Sept. 23.

Copeland was found with a gunshot wound in the 1200 block of East Hudson Street. He was taken to Grant Medical Center where he died a short time later, with his death marking the 102nd homicide in Columbus this year.

Police said Copeland was standing in an alley south of East Hudson Street when he was confronted by a group of men. One of the men pulled out a handgun and shot Copeland multiple times. The group then fled the scene.

According to court records, surveillance video revealed that Robinson was the one who shot Copeland several times.

Robinson is charged with one count of murder and was given a $1 million bond when he appeared in Franklin County Municipal Court Wednesday morning. His next court date is scheduled for Oct. 14.

Earlier this week, police issued warrants for the arrest of 31-year-old Rayshawn Rogers, 34-year-old Christian Capers and 35-year-old Damon Capers in connection to Copeland’s death.

According to police, family and friends of Copeland believe he sold narcotics to Lithasha Streeter, which caused her death by overdose. Streeter is a possible relative of Rogers.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372038/gill-physically-mentally-tortured-and-sexually-abused-claims-imran,"Gill subjected to ‘sexual abuse’, claims Imran","Former prime minister Imran Khan on Friday stunned the nation when he claimed that his chief of staff Dr Shahbaz Gill was sexually abused, vowing that he would leave no stone unturned to bring to justice those who were responsible for mentally and physically torturing his aide.

Announcing taking out a rally on Saturday (today) against the alleged torture on his aide facing charges of inciting mutiny in the army, the PTI chairman said that he has obtained detailed information about the “inhuman treatment” meted out to Gill and questioned “who tortured Gill”, especially, when the capital’s police said it did not inflict any torture.

Gill was arrested from Bani Gala Chowk in Islamabad a few days ago after a video clip of his controversial remarks aired on a television channel went viral on social media. He was subsequently booked on charges of inciting mutiny in the military. However, roughly 10 days after his arrest, the PTI chairman and the party leadership adopted an offensive mode with all guns blazing and decided to take to the streets.

After seeing photos and videos showing Gill gasping for air while being taken to the court and hospital, the PTI chairman went to see Gill at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on Friday evening but was denied permission.

Talking to the media at PIMS, the former PM said that if a political worker can be tortured, one could imagine what an ordinary citizen goes through, adding that such “inhuman treatment” and “torture of a political worker” was unacceptable.

“All the pictures & videos show clearly [Shahbaz] Gill was tortured both mentally & physically incl[uding] sexual abuse - most too gruesome to relate. He was humiliated to break him down,” Imran tweeted while sharing a video of Gill wherein he could be seen pleading for an oxygen mask.

While questioning who tortured Gill, Imran without specifically naming anyone stated that “there is a general perception in the public at large & in our minds too as to who could have carried out the gruesome torture”, warning “remember the public will react”. Subsequently, Imran vowed to leave “no stone unturned to find out those [who are] responsible & bring them to justice.”

Meanwhile, the PTI leadership strongly condemned how Gill was being treated in detention, saying the medical reports were “very alarming”. Former foreign minister and PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that the power and revenge has blinded the rulers sitting in Islamabad so much that they are violating all democratic values and human rights as a “political prisoner Shahbaz Gill is being subjected to the worst form of mental and physical torture”. Qureshi also vowed that the “perpetrators” of the “barbaric violence” would surely and soon be held accountable.

In a statement after a meeting of the PTI’s senior party leadership presided over Imran, PTI Central Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said that the party strongly condemned the physical, mental and sexual violence against Gill, adding that he was “stripped naked and tortured”.

Fawad said that any decent person could not support such violence which was why it was being condemned by all political parties. “The medical reports and photos showed that Gill was subjected to inhuman treatment and all the reports are being handed over to the relevant institutions,” he said.

Fawad announced that Imran Khan would lead a rally against the torture from China Chowk Islamabad to F-9 Park, saying organisations of all divisional headquarters across the country would take out rallies, which would be led by the local leadership and PTI chairman would address them.

These protest rallies would be taken out to denounce violence against Gill and curbs on freedom of expression, he said, expressing that the “dark night would end soon and sun would surely rise”. He said that Imran went to meet Gill at PIMS hospital to assure him that the entire party stood by him.

Referring to the PTI’s planned rallies, he said that Imran would start a rally from Rawalpindi on August 21 and the series would continue till September 10. He said that the end of the government was inevitable before September 10, reiterating that political stability could only be achieved in Pakistan through fresh, fair and transparent elections.

Meanwhile, PTI leader Dr Babar Awan while addressing a news conference said that Gill was an asset of the PTI and the whole party was standing to defend him. Awan said that he could not tell what crime was committed against Gill, adding that Gill was tortured in such a way that “neither it can be told nor shown”. Expressing that the traditions and Islamic values bar him from giving exact details, Awan questioned: “What could be worse for a man if he is stripped naked?”",Q3

https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2022/08/university-james-cates-memorial-community,Remembering James Cates: UNC announces plans for a permanent memorial,"According to the memorial proposal, Cates’ murder was neglected by police and ""largely forgotten about by the University community and people of Chapel Hill.""

Cates’ family released a statement to the public following the announcement of the permanent memorial. The statement thanked UNC students and community members who have continuously advocated for action.

“We are grateful for this development while also acknowledging our heartbreak that it has taken more than fifty years to get here,” the statement said.

Foushee said the memorial is a step in the right direction and she hopes more steps will be taken by the University community in the future.

“Our whole purpose in this was to have our whole history acknowledged in such a way that all of us would remember what can happen when we’re not loving, when we’re not accepting and when we don’t embrace our differences,” she said.

A proposal was submitted to the chancellor, vice chancellor and members of the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Naming University Facilities and Units, proposing that the Daniels building — commonly known as the UNC Student Stores building — be named in remembrance of Cates.

Taliajah “Teddy” Vann, UNC's student body president, said she and the administration are committed to developing a memorial that is consistent with the family’s wishes.

“I have every confidence in our chancellor's commitment to ensuring that any memorial that is erected for James Lewis Cates Jr. is one that is in line with what his family wants to see on our campus,” Vann said.

The James Cates Building Proposal was submitted on June 15, 2021 and signed by members of the James Cates Remembrance Coalition. The document was also endorsed by organizations and individuals, including but not limited to Chapel Hill residents, University professors and community activists.

The James Lewis Cates Jr. Memorial Committee, UNC Black Student Movement and other organizations have had a significant impact in the efforts to establish a permanent memorial.

The goal of the James Lewis Cates Jr. Memorial Committee is to ""establish a permanent memorial on (UNC's) campus to honor (Cates') life and memory,"" according to a March 2021 Instagram post on @jlcmemorialproject.

Almost 52 years after Cates' murder, UNC students and community members continue to be adamant about remembering Cates through a memorial. Nicole Murashima, a sophomore at the University, said that the memorial will have a lot of visibility in the Pit, due to its central location on campus.

“The Pit is obviously a place where I walk by everyday and I know a lot of other people do, so it would serve as a good reminder because we’re still grappling with racial inequality and discrimination in all forms,” she said.

Murashima said that the memorial will have a lot of value and meaning on campus.

“We need to be super intentional about these symbols that we’re putting out because they’re not just statues,"" she said. ""They represent our school of thought. They represent our history.""

Amy Maddox, a biology professor at UNC is one of the supporters of the proposal and said in an email statement to The Daily Tar Heel that the installation is an important step.

“I am grateful to the historians, advocates and Cates’ family who got us to this point,” Maddox wrote.

Erika Richmond, a post-doctoral research associate and supporter of the proposal said that her hope for the memorial is for it to continue to spark conversations.

She hopes that the University and the student body continue to foster a progressive dialogue surrounding race-based issues on campus.

“I don’t know if it’s enough to put a memorial,"" Richmond said.

Vann said this is a fight that the family and community has carried for decades.

“It's something that has affected our campus, but what's most important — in my view — is the impact that it does have on this family, and I pray that this will be them receiving some semblance of peace,” she said.

Vann said she is grateful that the memorial is being erected, and that it isn’t just a victory under the belt of a student leader.

“It was 50 years of other people's work that ultimately got us here,” Vann said.

https://www.weeklyblitz.net/politics/political-career-of-liz-cheney-ends-next-week/,Political career of Liz Cheney ends next week,"Political career of Liz Cheney ends next week

Liz Cheney, a pseudo Democrat and harsh opponent of Donald Trump will face an end to her clumsy political career next week with a humiliating defeat. Meanwhile, left-leaning newspaper The New York Times is already preparing the post-election spin boosting the post congressional exploits of Liz Cheney. On August 8, 2022, NYT published a front-page report captioned ‘Cheney ready to lose a race, but not a fight’.

What fight Cheney will continue? A fight to destroy America’s fabric and transform it into a Banana Republic? Possibly that has already been jointly done by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Department of Justice and Federal Burau of Investigation (FBI). America’s democracy has already been murdered and cremated. Still NYT wants a defeated Liz Cheney to further destabilize America?

New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin laid it on thick: “She has used the Aug. 16 contest as a sort of a high-profile stage for her martyrdom — and a proving ground for her new crusade”. Martyrdom? She’s not being burned at the stake like Joan of Arc, even if that’s the kind of moral high ground the liberal media coverage suggests.

She’s losing her race “in part because of death threats, her office says”.

Her new crusade is the media’s old crusade. The pull quote on the back of the front section read, “If the cost of standing up for the Constitution is losing the House seat, then that’s a price I’m willing to pay”. Martin also insisted she “has become arguably the most consequential rank-and-file member of Congress in modern times”.

She will be “consequential” if the January 6 committee somehow helps ruin Donald Trump before 2024. Liz Cheney is only “rank-and-file” because she was tossed out of the House Republican leadership for seeking an entirely new constituency: The New York Times, The Washington Post and the alphabet of liberal TV networks.

Martin hyped speculation that “she is preparing to run for president. She has done little to dissuade such talk”. Martin touted a house party in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where the (unnamed) host introduced the congresswoman by comparing her to Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who confronted Senator Joseph McCarthy when that was considered daring, and then in 1964 went on to become the first female candidate for president “from a major party”. That campaign went nowhere.

In two successive CNN interviews, Jake Tapper and Kasie Hunt each oozed and pressed her about running for president. These salutes look to Republican voters like the fringe benefits of aiding the liberal media.

Liz Cheney claimed she is still Republican, but “when asked if the GOP, she was raised in was even salvageable in the short term”, she said that “it may not be” and called her party “very sick”. In other words, this all sounds like the 2024 version of Evan McMullin for president — a protest vote for never-Trumpers.

The New York Times recently reported liberal Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife donated more than US$43,000 to her campaign “and groups supporting her”. Katzenberg said he was talking up Cheney to “anybody and everybody that will listen to me”. The Cheney campaign sent mailers to registered Democrats with instructions on how to change parties ahead of the primary to vote for her.",Q3

Justin Howard Petty, 36, was convicted Thursday in the shooting death of 31-year-old Billy Eddings. He was arrested in July 2021 on a first-degree murder charge after being in California and Las Vegas for about nine months.

A Miller County jury deliberated for about an hour on the verdict and 15 minutes on the sentencing.

The jury also gave Petty a 15-year enhancement sentence that will run consecutive to the life sentence.

In Arkansas, a felony committed with a firearm can result in an enhanced sentence of up to 15 years, prosecutor Connie Mitchell said.

Police were called to the 600 block of Fairview the afternoon of Sept. 29, 2020, in reference to a shooting. Eddings was discovered dead outside his home “surrounded by shell casings,” according to police.

Witnesses identified Petty, also known as J.P., as the shooter and told investigators that Eddings and Petty had been friends but had argued over missing Xanax pills.

The state claimed Petty left Eddings’ home but returned a short time later and began firing at Eddings with a handgun, striking him at least once in the chest.

Mitchell said she was pleased with the verdict and thinks Eddings’ family is also.

Video from security cameras at the victim’s house and a neighboring house was used in court by the prosecution.

“I think the video really made a difference,” said Mitchell, noting how rare it is to have a live video of a felony crime.",Q3

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Sacramento Police are calling it an explosion of the ghost guns. A ghost gun is a weapon that is illegal to possess. It’s an untraceable gun because it doesn’t have a serial number and isn’t registered. Sergeant Zachary Eaton explains the recent uptick is due to online accessibility.

“They’ll come 80% finished and it really doesn’t take much to finish a certain portion of the gun to actually make it a gun and for the pieces to be put together very quickly,” said Eaton.

Sergeant Eaton says they main way they are taking these illegal guns off the street is through car stops and proactive interactions with the community.

“We don’t know that they exist like I said it is very concerning to us that these guns are ending up in the hands of people prohibited from possessing them,” said Eaton.

Sergeant Eaton says new legislation is one solution. A new California law requires gun parts to have serial numbers.

Californians have until January 1, 2024, to register them and add the numbers.

Sac PD also has a detective with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) task force in Sacramento specifically dealing with ghost guns.

“This year we’ve assigned two additional detectives to the ATF task force to step up our efforts to get these illegal guns of the streets and address people who are actually manufacturing these firearms and trafficking these firearms into our community,” said Eaton.

Sacramento Police says ghost guns are directly contributing to the rise in gun violence in the community.

Just one example of ghost guns in our community is less than two weeks ago in Stockton a loaded hand gun was taken from a student at Lincoln High School, that was a ghost gun.

https://www.essence.com/celebrity/ye-kanye-west-good-morning-america-interview/,Ye (Kanye West) Compares Co-Parenting Conflict To Brand Battles On 'Good Morning America' | Essence,"Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, appeared on Good Morning America today for a rare televised interview, opening up about his very public social media displays of frustration in recent months.

The rapper and fashion mogul has raised eyebrows throughout 2022 for launching into multiple tirades and posting sprees on Instagram, airing out grievances about everything from his brand deals with Adidas and Gap, to his dissolving marriage and rocky co-parenting relationship with Kim Kardashian.

“This is the mother of my children, and I apologize for any stress that I have caused, even in my frustration, because God calls me to be stronger,” Ye, said of his posts toward his ex-wife, particularly amid the emergence of her new relationship post-Ye. “But also, ain’t nobody else finna be causing no stress either.”

“I need this person to be least stressed and of best, sound mind and as calm as possible to be able to raise those children.”

Those children, 9-year-old North, 6-year-old Saint, 4-year-old Chicago and 3-year-old Psalm, all shared with Kardashian, have been a public point of contention for Ye in recent months, as he has engaged in a one-sided social media battle with his former spouse over things ranging from the manner of dress North wears to the school his two eldest children should attend.

The school battle stems from the creation of his own enrichment academy. Despite claiming to have never personally read a book, Ye opened The Donda Academy (formerly known as Yeezy Christian Academy) in Simi Valley California. Named after his late mother Donda West and currently boasting an enrollment of about 82 students, the school recently came under scrutiny for being unaccredited and requiring parents to sign NDAs for their children’s attendance.

Ye is adamant that he would like his children to attend his academy, which he claims provides children with “practical tools that they need in a world post the iPhone being created.”

“I want my kids to go to Donda, and I have to fight for a say so,” he told GMA’s Linsey Davis. He stressed that the children spend time singing gospel music, and focus on “practical skills” necessary into today’s world, such as computer programming, engineering, and farming.

“So many schools are made to set kids up for industries that don’t even matter anymore,” he said, noting that his academy also boasts tutors that focus on specific materials and could “actually turn your kids into, like, geniuses.”

“And if your kids are geniuses…they’re three grade levels ahead.”

Ye also likened the battle over his children’s education to those he’s having with his two fashion industry collaborators, Adidas and Gap.

“There are just little nuances to where there was a parallel between what was happening at Gap, what was happening at Adidas, and what was happening in my home,” he said. “It was all kind of a disregard for the voice over something that I co-created. I co-created the children. I co-created the product at Adidas. I co-created the product at Gap. There’s a parallel. And the parallel does touch on discrimination.”

To avoid that discrimination, Ye recently announced the dissolution of his contract with Adidas, stating that he would now bring his popular products directly to the consumer – a solution which, Davis noted, was famously provided to him by media personality Sway back in 2013, which Ye infamously rebuffed at the time.

“You know what? I will go ahead and say Sway had the answer,” Ye said, smiling.",Q3

KARACHI: Police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested the “mastermind” and “facilitator” of a suicide attack outside the Confucious Institute at the Karachi University in which three Chinese nationals were killed.

The police produced the suspect Dad Buksh before an anti-terror court, seeking physical remand which was duly granted till July 16.

According to police, the suspect is the commander of banned outfits Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) in Katachi and planned the attack on Chinese teachers inside the Karachi University on April 26.

The police said that he used to facilitate the attacks on Chinese nationals in Karachi and was arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department a day prior in a raid in the city.

The arrested suspect is being considered an important arrest as the security agencies believe that his arrest will break the organisation's network.



The suspect is allegedly involved in the April 26 suicide bombing at the University of Karachi. The suicide bombing was carried out by a female suicide bomber who was later identified as Shari Baloch.

Three Chinese tutors and a Pakistani driver had lost their lives and three others including a Chinese tutor and a Rangers personnel were also wounded in the attack.

The attack resulted in the suspension of the Chinese language centre at the KU. The Pakistani authorities have worked hard to nab the culprits involved in the attack.

‘Foreign hand behind attack’

Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon has hailed the performance of law enforcement agencies for arresting the “mastermind” and “facilitator” of the suicide attack on the Chinese tutors at the Karachi University.

He maintained that banned BLF sleeper cell commander Dad Buksh alias Shoab alias Jahanzaib alias Mirza was taken into custody during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Mauripur Road in Karachi on July 4 by the CTD.

During the initial investigation, Memon said the arrested suspect confessed that he was involved in conducting a recce of KU and sensitive installations. He said that Dad Buksh is an expert at making IEDs.

The suspect told the officials that Zaib was the mastermind of the KU suicide attack, adding that he entered Pakistan from a neighbouring country. He said that two banned organizations were involved in the attack.

“The militants carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan with the help of foreign states to stop investment in the country,” he added.

The minister said that the terrorists wanted to create instability in Pakistan.

Responding to a question, the minister said that the investigation is in the initial stages, hence he did not want to reveal the name of the country from where he reached Pakistan.

Speaking on the occasion, Karachi Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab said that four characters were involved in the KU suicide blast, adding that they have been identified.

On his part, Colonel Nasruminallah said that the woman suicide bomber might have been given drugs ahead of the attack. A team of psychologists also watched the videos, he said, adding that it seemed by the body language of the woman that she was brainwashed.",Q3
https://www.wionews.com/opinions-blogs/pakistan-and-afghanistans-farce-over-masood-azhar-concerning-but-amusing-517702,"Pakistan and Afghanistan's farce over Masood Azhar. Concerning, but amusing","New Delhi, India

Indian authorities had no option but to free terrorist Mohammed Masood Azhar Alvi when terrorists hijacked an Indian Airlines plane in 1999 and demanded his release in exchange for passengers. Azhar, chief of the terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has been linked to many terrorist attacks, including some in India since his release.

Advertisment

After he walked free, he made a public address to an estimated 10,000 people in Karachi. He said, ""I have come here because this is my duty to tell you that Muslims should not rest in peace until we have destroyed India.""

JeM's chief Azhar was responsible for the attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, killing 14 people. After India put pressure on Pakistani authorities, he was arrested but not formally charged. The court also ended his house arrest in December 2002.

The responsibility for the 2019 Pulwama attack, which claimed the lives of 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel in India, was taken by JeM. It is said that Azhar approved the attacks from the Pakistani Army Hospital where he was under protective custody.

Advertisment

Indian investigative agencies continued their investigation to find out the whereabouts of Masood Azhar. On several occasions, Indian counterterror agencies confirmed the information related to his location and provided it to concerned countries. Indian agencies have even given dossiers containing proof of Azhar's complicity in the terror attack and also sought a second 'red corner notice' from 'Interpol'. But, Azhar still walks free.

Now, the world is watching Pakistan and Afghanistan's diplomatic spat over UN-designated terrorist Azhar. It is quite amusing to see Pakistan claiming that Masood Azhar is in Afghanistan. But the Taliban has rejected the claims and in return, Kabul even said that such organisations can operate on Pakistan's soil, even under ""official patronage"".

Such remarks by Pakistan also show its desperation to get out of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list. The Paris-based international watchdog has forced Islamabad to take action against some of the UN-designated terrorists.

Advertisment

Pakistan, which is known to harbour terrorists, had many chances to take action and arrest the mastermind of many terrorist attacks. But the authorities kept saying that Azhar is untraceable.

But when the FATF greylist started biting the economy, the country began the adventure. Pakistan has appeared on the FATF greylist multiple times since 2008. Being in greylist has had a significant impact on Pakistan's economy, particularly its financial services industry.

The Taliban, on the other hand, have rejected the claims that Azhar is currently on its soil. The extremist regime is busy portraying its clean image at the global forum to improve its foreign relations and invite investment to help the dwindling economy. But at the same time, reports of atrocities, killings, and brutality keep coming from the region.

After Azhar's reports, the Taliban-led Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) said that such allegations can affect the relations between Kabul and Islamabad. Abdul Qahar Balkhi, a Talibani spokesman said, ""We also call on all parties to refrain from such allegations lacking any proof and documentation. Such media allegations can adversely affect bilateral relations.""

Last month, United States President Joe Biden said that Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in a drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan. But the Taliban denied it, saying that they do not have any information regarding Zawahiri's presence in Afghanistan.

Masood Azhar is the world's problem. His arrest is necessary, but the recent claims and counterclaims show it's uncertain.

Rusty Taco, an Atlanta-based chain owned by Inspire Brands, has opened its first Nevada restaurant at 9780 S. Virginia St., formerly the home of Nu Yalk Pizza. The franchise is operated by local fast-food magnates Taylor and Ian Cain, longtime owners of the local Sonic Drive-Ins.

Larry Clark is accusing Interplastic Corp. of negligence, claiming it allowed chemicals to be released into the surrounding neighborhood and into his home, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.

The lawsuit stems from a Jan. 10 incident at the plant that resulted in a shelter-in-place order being issued for residents within 1,000 feet of the facility.

Emergency crews from Fort Wright and several other surrounding agencies responded to the plant after an explosion was reported involving a storage vessel housing polyester resin, according to officials with the city of Fort Wright.

The complaint says Clark, who lives near the plastics resin plant at 3535 Latonia Ave., suffered injuries to his eyes and lungs as a result of chemical exposure.

An attorney for Interplastic has yet to return a message from The Enquirer seeking comment.

In court documents, attorneys for the company said Clark's claim ""is nothing more than mere speculation, and does not include any detail at all concerning any of the elements of a claim for personal injury arising from chemical exposure.""

Interplastic has asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit in its entirety.

Paul Dickman, the attorney representing Clark, previously represented residents of Covington's Latonia neighborhood in a 1997 lawsuit against Interplastic, according to documents filed in Kenton County Circuit Court.

That suit also accused the company of exposing nearby residents to concentrations of hazardous chemicals, court records show. The case was ultimately settled and Interplastic did not admit to any wrongdoing.

As part of the settlement agreement, Interplastic entered into a consent decree which requires the company to provide the Fort Wright and Covington fire departments annual access to the facility as well as safety data sheets for the chemicals used or stored there.",Q3
https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/20446337.cest-la-vie-indie-music-night-returns-blackburn-25-years/,C'est La Vie indie music night returns to Blackburn after 25 years,"Thirty-five years ago, two friends, Ronnie Brown and David Hamer, started an Indie music night called C’est La Vie, in a tiny club on Market Street Lane in Blackburn.

An original event night poster

Within six months it had become the ‘go to place’ for people who were into music not being played in the charts – and was responsible for the first ever acid house nights in Blackburn.

According to Mr Brown, in the 10 years the club was open, people were seen regularly queueing round the block to get in, with the venue hosting dozens of bands such as the Manic Street Preachers, 808 State, Inspiral Carpets and A Guy Called Gerald.

And now, the famous Indie night held at the venue will be returning to the Dun Horse, on Market Street Lane, on Saturday July 30.

Mr Brown said: “I was approached by the landlady, Chloe, to do something at the Dun Horse, which ironically is next to the old venue.

“She had been getting lots of comments about how the club and the night used to be next door and wished there was something like that now.

“During our time there we were fortunate to work with the owners, who left the music policy to Dave and myself.

“Initially we played soul, funk, and jazz, but that broadened out to be an anything goes policy - as long as the dancefloor was full.

“It would take a monumental effort to compile a playlist, but as is well documented, we did the first ever acid house nights in Blackburn (predating the infamous parties), and were responsible for bringing bands like 808 State, A Guy Called Gerald, Inspiral Carpets, the Manic Street Preachers and dozens more to Blackburn.”

Mr Brown said legendary radio DJ, John Peel, even phoned him up one day to ask how he’d managed to get A Guy Called Gerald to play in Blackburn.

Mr Brown continued: “The late John Peel actually rang my house to check how and why Gerald was playing at our place when he had only ever played Manchester and New York, it was bizarre.

“He even name dropped the club in one of his shows, and ID, the original style magazine for youth culture, were aware of us too.

“After we left in 1996, the venue became a rock/metal/emo club but fizzled out shortly after.”

The event at the Dun Horse will be a Ces't La Vie night, with a similar soundtrack, playing music from the likes of Suede, Orange Juice, Pixies, The Fall, Oasis, Rolling Stones, Happy Mondays, Velvet Underground, The Kinks, REM, EMF, James and many, many more.

Mr Brown went on: “We are expecting a lot of old faces, and I know many already who are coming down. It’s a very small venue so we’ll see what happens but if it goes well we are hoping to repeat and hold more in the future.”

Making a very rare appearance at the venue on the night will be one of Blackburn's finest bands, 3 Men Gone Mad, who will be performing their first show in more than 18 years.

C'est La Vie will be held at the Dun Horse on Saturday July 30.

Admission is £5 and starts at 8pm.

The Benson County Sheriff's Office announced in a press release last week that they arrested Erin Christensen, 38, of Maddock, on Sept. 14 after they served search warrants in and around the town.

On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Christensen was charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement, tampering with physical evidence, and unlawful possession of furbearers.

Christensen is accused of bringing the wild animal into a local bar on Sept. 6, prompting state health officials to issue a rabies warning, the Bismarck Tribune reported.

A bartender told the newspaper that Christensen showed the animal off to customers, adding that it did not bite anyone.

The woman said her family found the animal, which they later named Rocky, about three months ago on the side of a road, the Associated Press reported.

She said they were attempting to nurse it back to health before releasing back into the wild, the news outlet reported.

The sheriff's office said the animal, which is illegal to keep under North Dakota Board of Animal Health laws, was euthanized and tested for rabies.

The Associated Press reported that the animal tested negative for rabies.

According to the news outlet, Christensen is set to appear in court on Monday.

If convicted, she faces about two years in jail and could be fined $7,500, the Associated Press reported.

The Jackson County Sheriff's Office on Friday announced the arrest of Wanda Palmer's brother, Daniel Palmer III, 55, in connection with a 2020 attack against his sister that left her ""hacked"" and ""left for dead"" before she fell into a coma. Authorities charged Daniel Palmer with attempted murder and malicious wounding.

While Levin described the case as ""exceedingly rare"" and ""the kind of thing that novels are written about,"" the New York City-based criminal defense lawyer, who also represents faux German heiress Anna ""Delvey"" Sorokin, says people's memories ""of important events rarely falter.""

""Whereas you might forget what you had for dinner last week, you don't forget the identity of the perpetrator of an attack that almost killed you,"" Levin explained. ""And this is not a case where the defense will be able to argue mistaken identity because it's her brother, and it's not a stranger. So, it makes her identification that much stronger.""

Neighbors found Wanda Palmer unconscious and slumped over a couch in her home on Flatwoods Road in Ravenswood, West Virginia, on June 10, 2020, according to court documents obtained by Fox 11 WVAH.

Her brother had already been a person of interest, but authorities could not file charges until they received a statement from Wanda identifying her brother as the person who attempted to kill her, the outlet reported.

Daniel Palmer's defense team ""may seek to attack"" Wanda Palmer's identification ""as a faulty memory of someone coming out of a coma"" in the case of a criminal trial, Levin said, but the attorney ultimately thinks ""the defense is going to have a very difficult time arguing away this identification, which is… a core piece of evidence against"" Daniel Palmer.

Wanda started to mutter words on June 27 after being in a coma for about two years. On July 12, police went to visit Wanda in the nursing home where she was receiving care and questioned her about the 2020 incident.

Levin added that a firsthand account of the attack and the suspected perpetrator from Wander Palmer ""throws the case into a completely different posture"" and allowed Jackson County officials to arrest and charge Daniel Palmer even though he was already a suspect in the case.

On the other hand, Daniel Palmer's defense team may also use the two-year gap between the time Wander Palmer fell into a coma and the time she woke up to make the case of a faulty memory. Additionally, they may seek more information for how sheriff's deputies handled their initial questioning of Wanda Palmer and whether they asked her ""open-ended"" or ""pointed"" questions ""slanted in such a way that they prompted her to identify her brother,"" Levin explained.",Q3

https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2022/07/ukraines_ambassador_to_germany_touts_nazi_war_criminal_as_a_hero.html,Ukraine's ambassador to Germany touts Nazi war criminal as a hero,"In Europe, the past never goes away, and that's certainly true in Central and Eastern Europe. We've already heard about the openly Nazi brigades in the modern Ukraine army. Now, to make it worse, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany just touted as one of Ukraine's greatest freedom fighters Stephan Bandera, who helped murder 800,000 Ukrainian Jews and 40,000–100,000 Poles. That didn't surprise me at all. It's what I expected.

From the start of Russia's assault on Ukraine, I've been ambivalent. On the one hand, I was horrified as all people of conscience must be when they see a military power brutally attack an innocent civilian population. On the other hand, having some familiarity with both Ukrainian and Russian history, I knew that (a) this was a fight going back centuries, (b) we had no business getting involved in a regional war, and (c) I don't have particularly warm feelings for either combatant.

Both Ukraine and the USSR behaved horribly during WWII, including allying with the Nazis. Ukraine was especially gleeful as it joined the Nazis in slaughtering Jews within its territory. It did so with such vigor that even the Nazis were shocked.

Nor does it matter to me that the current president of Ukraine is nominally Jewish. So were the Kapos in the concentration camps and George Soros. The worst antisemites in the world have been Jews (see, e.g., Karl Marx, whose father had him convert as a small boy, and who went on to bake antisemitism into the socialist cake).

That's why I wasn't at all surprised to read David P. Goldman's article about Andrej Melnyk, who insisted during an interview with Germany's Die Welt that Bandera was nothing more than a freedom fighter:



Image: Andrej Melnyk. YouTube screen grab.

Germany's leading center-right newspaper Die Welt posted a banner headline at the top of its page last Friday evening just before Shabbat came in here in New York: ""[Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrej] Melnyk's statement trivializes the Holocaust."" In a radio interview last week, Melnyk compared Ukrainian Nazi leader Stephan Bandera to Robin Hood and vehemently denied—in the face of massive historical documentation—that Bandera had helped to murder 800,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II. The Banderites also helped to murder between 40,000 and 100,000 Poles. [snip] Melnyk said, ""Not just for me, but for many, many Ukrainians, he personifies the freedom fighter… and of course a freedom fighter… There are now written laws for those who fight for freedom. Robin Hood is also respected by everyone, and he also did not work according to the law current at the time."" The astonished German interviewer said, ""And you admit that he and his men were involved in the murder of 800,000 Jews?"" ""No, he was not involved,"" said Melnyk The interviewer protested, ""But it was his army. That's what his men did. There is no doubt about that."" Melnyk retorted, ""You say, 'No doubt,' but there is no evidence. He was not convicted."" ""There is no evidence that he killed Jews with his own hands, but his men did!"" the interviewer insisted. ""He ordered the murder of 100,000 civilians."" ""He did not give the order to exterminate Jews,"" Melnyk continued. The interviewer quoted leaflets distributed by Bandera to Ukrainians as the Germans marched in 1941: ""People! You must know this. Muscovites (Russians), Poles, Ukrainians, Hungarians and Jews are your enemies. Destroy them! You must know this. Your Führer Stepan Bandera.""

Later, writes Goldman, the Ukrainian foreign ministry refused to repudiate Melnyk's statements, merely saying that they represented his ""personal opinion.""

The worst thing about all of this, adds Goldman, is how assiduously the Biden administration and the American media are ignoring this grotesque Holocaust denial. Even American Jewish organizations are refusing to address the subject.

Here's the bottom line: Ukraine is the ""good guy"" right now, and nobody dares reveal that it has not just feet of clay, but most of its lower torso made of clay. Russia is not our friend, but neither is Ukraine. Despite their Western gloss, their values are very different from ours, and we blindly alienate one and fawn over the other at our peril.",Q3
https://www.weeklyblitz.net/opinion/zionist-joe-biden-and-neglected-parents-of-malki-roth/,‘Zionist’ Joe Biden and neglected parents of Malki Roth,"‘Zionist’ Joe Biden and neglected parents of Malki Roth

During his first visit as the US President and tenth as a politician, Joe Biden declared himself a Zionist stating “You need not be a Jew to be a Zionist”.

Recalling his father’s tableside discussions on World War II and the Holocaust Joe Biden said: “He taught us all about what happened in the Holocaust. Why weren’t the tracks bombed, why did we not – why, why, why. He imbued in us a sense of the obligation that we all have.

“Now, as president, I am proud to say that our relationship with the State of Israel is deeper and stronger, in my view, than it has ever been”.

Wish I could tell a fellow Zionist – thank you Mr. President – Kol Hakavod! Wish I really could! But I know, a president who is facing numerous crises at home and been already branded as “unfit” to run the office is not at all a Zionist. It was all he was reading the script written by bunch of pundits sitting in the White House. All he wants is a cheap publicity stunt and earn sympathy of the Jewish and pro-Israel voters in the United States.

One of the many reasons that I do not believe Joe Biden to be a Zionist is his cruel ignorance of a letter that he has recently received from Arnold Roth and Frimet Roth, parents of Malki Roth, the victim of 2001 Sbarro pizzeria bombing.

The family of Malki Roth, an Israeli-American girl killed in the attack, have asked for a meeting with Biden during his Israel visit. They wanted him to press Jordan, a close American ally, to send terrorist and the mastermind of the 2001 suicide bomb attack – Ahlam Tamimi to the US for trial.

“We ask that you address this as only the leader of the United States can,” Frimet and Arnold Roth, the parents of Malki Roth, who was 15 when she was killed in the attack, wrote in a letter. “We are bereaved parents as you are, sir. We have a burning sense that injustice in the wake of our child’s murder is winning”.

The Roths have been waging a campaign for the extradition of Tamimi since she was released by Israel in a 2011 prisoner swap with the Hamas terrorist group and sent to her native Jordan, where she lives freely and has been a familiar face in the media.

“The US government continues to seek her extradition and the Government of Jordan’s assistance in bringing her to justice for her role in the heinous attack”, the US National Security Council said.

On August 9, 2001, a Palestinian bomber, under the direct command of Ahlam Tamimi walked into a Jerusalem pizzeria and blew himself up, killing 15 people. Two American citizens, including Roth, were among the dead.

Tamimi, who chose the target and guided the bomber there, was arrested weeks later and sentenced by Israel to 16 life sentences. Since her release, she has expressed no remorse and has boasted that she was pleased with the high death toll.

In a 2017 interview with The Associated Press, she said the Palestinians have a right to resist Israel by any means, including deadly attacks.

The Roths have repeatedly called on US authorities to press Jordan, which has received billions of dollars in American assistance, to turn over Tamimi for trial.

The United States has charged Tamimi with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against American nationals. The charge was filed under seal in 2013 and announced by the Justice Department four years later. Her name was added to the FBI’s list of Most Wanted Terrorists.

The US and Jordan signed an extradition treaty in 1995. But in 2017, Jordan’s high court blocked her extradition, reportedly claiming the treaty was never ratified.

Two years ago, the Trump administration said it was considering withholding aid to Jordan over the case, but ultimately no action was taken.

“Something is obviously terribly wrong with how the pursuit of America’s most wanted female fugitive is going”, the Roths wrote in their letter, sent to Biden through the US Embassy.

“We want to explain this to you better in a face-to-face meeting,” they added. “We want you to look us in the eyes, Mr. President, and tell us how Jordan’s king can be a praiseworthy ally”.

I am shocked, stunned and of course angry at silence of Joe Biden or his staffers on this extremely important issue. May I ask – why a self-proclaimed Zionist Joe Biden ignored the letter from Roths and did not spare them couple of minutes, at least and listened to their plea? Why?

And here is the worst part of Joe Biden’s mockery. In his speech immediately after stepping into the soil of Israel, Biden said: “We will discuss my continued support – even though I know it is not in the near term – a two-state solution. It remains, in my view, the best way to ensure the, in equal measure, of freedom, prosperity, and democracy for Israelis and Palestinians alike”.

A two-state solution? What??? You are planning to give legitimacy to those Palestinian invaders, who came from Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and other Arab countries and illegally captured Israeli land for decades? Why you are insisting of opening an US consulate in Jerusalem? Do you think, we don’t sense your ulterior motives? You want to divide the city of Jerusalem despite the fact of it being the undivided and eternal capital of the Jewish State?

I would like to firm say – if you, President Joe Biden really uphold the spirits of Zionism, then you show us some evidence. Exert tremendous pressure of King Abdullah II and Jordan to immediately extradite terrorist Ahlam Tamimi to the US. Also please, refrain from pushing your nefarious agenda of opening a consulate in Jerusalem for the Palestinians.",Q3
https://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-news-host-thinks-qanon-salute-at-trump-rally-is-a-call-for-unity/,Fox News Host Thinks QAnon Salute at Trump Rally is a ‘Call For Unity’,"A Fox News host claimed former President Donald Trump was calling for “unity” when his supporters put their index fingers in the air at a recent rally. In reality, the supporters were expressing support for a deranged conspiracy theory asserting Democrats are Satan-worshipping pedophiles.

Emily Compagno was bashing Hillary Clinton on Fox News show Outnumbered Monday after the former secretary of state compared Trump rallies to how Germans became enthralled with Adolf Hitler.

Compagno claimed that while Clinton was criticizing Trump, Trump himself was describing the United States as “one America,” and that his supporters were putting “the finger in the air saying one.”

“So his calls for unity are ironically met with her comparison of World War II,” Compagno said.

Ironically, it wasn’t a call for unity that prompted supporters at the Trump rally to put their fingers in the air.

It was Trump playing a song associated with QAnon, a conspiracy theory that asserts Democrats pedophiles who worship Satan and want to destroy the world. Trump, the theory holds, is the man who can stop this global cabal of pedos.

What’s more, in a clip that went viral of Trump playing the QAnon song, he was attacking President Joe Biden as “cognitively impaired,” the Justice Department as pursuing him in a witch hunt, “fake news” media being “the enemy of the people,” crime being “rampant,” etc.

You could describe his comments as the opposite of unifying:

this is one of the most bizarre things I’ve seen at a Trump rally. All it is missing is passing around Kool-Aid right after. pic.twitter.com/BmPOztb7kA — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 18, 2022

Of course, Trump has never been one to embrace unity, or nuance, or measured rhetoric of any kind. Winking at a conspiracy theory that deems your political opposition Satan-worshipping pedophiles is at this point par for the course.

Compagno is likely referring to another part of Trump’s speech, when he referred to his supporters as “one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious American nation.”

The QAnon song played throughout those comments as well, and his supporters raised their fingers before he made his comments about “one America.”

Even Trump’s team acknowledged the QAnon salute might have crossed a line. “Once we saw that, we realized we might have a problem,” a Trump aide told CNN after the first incident of finger-gesturing in Ohio earlier this month.

At Trump’s Friday rally in South Carolina, the former president once again played the QAnon song, and supporters in the crowd once again raised their fingers — prompting security working for Trump to tell the supporters to cut it out.

https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/politics/ohio-politics/conspiracy-theory-podcaster-barred-from-running-for-ohio-secretary-of-state,Conspiracy theory podcaster barred from running for Ohio Secretary of State,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — A conspiracy theory podcaster and election-denier has been barred from running for Ohio Secretary of State as an independent.

Terpsehore “Tore” Maras does not have enough valid signatures to get her name on the 2022 ballot, according to Kimberly Burns, the assistant Secretary of State who upheld an-ex Ohio Supreme Court justice's opinion.

Burns sent a letter Tuesday from Secretary of State Frank LaRose's office that the ""petition contains 4,993 valid signatures,"" while the minimum is 5,000.

LaRose's team made it clear that he was not involved in the denial of Maras from the ballot, saying that it is a formal and legal process to transfer over making that decision to Burns.

On Friday, Justice Terrence O'Donnell, who was chosen by the LaRose team to handle the case, decided to reject 18 of her 5,010 signatures. The Secretary of State's office gave her one back.

This rejection came after Justin Bis, executive director of the Ohio Republican Party, filed a complaint against Maras. Bis asserted she had 65 invalid signatures.

The podcaster had previously tried to run against LaRose in the primary as a Republican. She did not collect enough signatures for the ballot at that time, either.

This decision is final, however, Maras can try to sue.

Former US president Donald Trump branded as dark times for the nation an FBI raid on his Florida estate as part of an investigation into whether he took classified records from the White House.

Former US president Donald Trump says his Florida home was raided by FBI agents.

Trump, who was in New York during the search, said that agents had arrived with a warrant and broke open a safe at the Mar-A-Lago complex.

""After working and cooperating with the relevant government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said in his statement.

The 76-year-old added: ""These are dark times for our nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

Search

Though the search has been reported on an array of US media outlets, the Justice Department has declined to comment on the move and whether Attorney General Merrick Garland had personally authorised the search.

The Justice Department has been investigating the potential mishandling of classified information after the National Archives and Records Administration said it had retrieved from Mar-a-Lago 15 boxes of records containing classified information earlier this year.

The National Archives referred the matter to the Justice Department. Trump has maintained that presidential records were turned over in an ordinary and routine process.

Laws

There are a number of federal laws governing the handling of classified records and sensitive government documents, including statutes that make it a crime to remove such material and retain it at an unauthorised location.

Though a search warrant does not suggest that criminal charges are near or even expected, federal officials hoping to obtain one must first convince a judge that they have probable cause that a crime occurred.

In a social media post on Monday night, Trump denounced the search as a ""weaponisation of the Justice System, and attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024.""

Investigation

During the 2016 presidential election, Trump tried to exploit an FBI investigation into his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, over whether she mishandled classified information through a private email server she used as Secretary of State.

Then-FBI Director James Comey concluded that Clinton had sent and received classified information but the FBI did not recommend criminal charges because it determined that Clinton had not intended to break the law.

Trump lambasted that decision and then stepped up its criticism of the FBI as agents began investigating whether his campaign had colluded with Russia to tip the 2016 election.

He fired Comey during that probe, and though he appointed Wray months later, he routinely criticised him too while he was still president.

The search, which the FBI and Justice Department did not immediately confirm, marks a dramatic escalation in law enforcement scrutiny of Trump and comes amid a separate but intensifying probe into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

The projects were selected through a competitive grants process and each program will receive a one-year, $25,000 grant.

The projects focus on increasing education, risk reduction and screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, liver and HPV-associated cancers including anal and cervical, in the wake of mass screening postponements and cancellations due to COVID-19. These projects will have a direct impact on members of the LGBTQ+ community, many of whom lack access to cancer prevention and early detection services.

“We are thrilled to be supporting this diverse array of projects that bring attention to cancer screening disparities in the LGBTQ+ community,” said Heather Mackey, DNP, ANP-BC, AOCN, Senior Director of Cancer Prevention and Early Detection at the Prevent Cancer Foundation. “There is a great need to provide services to support the unique health barriers faced by this community, and our grantees are making that possible so all populations can access the health care they need to prevent cancer or detect it early.”

Since 2007, the Foundation has awarded more than $2 million in community grants in 37 states and American Samoa and to the Washoe Tribe. The 2022 community grant recipients include:

Albie Aware Inc.

Sacramento, Calif.

Albie Aware Breast Cancer Foundation, the largest nonprofit organization dedicated solely to breast cancer in the greater Sacramento area, will bring mobile mammograms to the LGBTQ+ community.

An update from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection on Saturday describes the Oak Fire as “extreme with frequent runs, spot fires and group torching” as the blaze reaches the Sierra National Forest.

“Emergency personnel are working to safely evacuate people and are actively engaged in protecting structures. Explosive fire behavior is challenging firefighters,” according to Cal Fire.

The fire – the largest among the state’s active wildfires – destroyed at least 10 residential and commercial structures and damaged at least five others as of Saturday morning. More than 6,555 acres burned by Saturday morning, with more than 400 fire personnel, 45 fire engines and four helicopters deployed to battle the blaze.

Several road closures include a portion of Highway 140, partially blocking access to Yosemite National Park.

The fire began Friday in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada near Midpines, roughly nine miles northeast from Mariposa, the seat of Mariposa County.

It is unclear what sparked the fire. Fire officials have reported that a combustible combination of intense heat, dry vegetation and intense drought have fuelled wildfire blazes that are difficult to get under control.

The state’s second-largest active wildfire, the Washburn Fire, has burned near the southern point of Yosemite for more than two weeks, burning nearly 5,000 acres, though officials report that it is 79 per cent contained.

Meanwhile, firefighters have made significant progress against a wildfire that began in Yosemite National Park and burned into the Sierra National Forest.

The Washburn Fire was 79% contained Friday after burning about 7.5 square miles (19.4 square kilometers) of forest.

https://keyt.com/news/2022/08/17/liz-cheneys-defeat-was-19-months-in-the-making/,How Liz Cheney lost Wyoming’s lone seat in the House,"By Eric Bradner and Jeff Zeleny, CNN

Rep. Liz Cheney’s supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.

Everything since that day — Cheney’s role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump’s influence — only served Harriet Hageman’s victory in Wyoming’s primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.

Cheney’s ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates — including Hageman — who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.

Primaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.

But Wyoming’s results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.

President Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.

Cheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans — many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months — to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.

But the Cowboy State’s electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state’s office. That’s a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.

“I think she stood up for what she believes in,” said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. “It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.”

‘Uneasy from the beginning’

The roots of Cheney’s loss were planted long before Tuesday’s primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.

The state’s GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.

The establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.

“In Wyoming, we don’t necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.

Wyoming Republicans’ reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others — including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.

But, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.

Cheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump’s actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.

The makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming’s GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden — Trump’s largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.

“Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,” Stubson said.

“Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn’t matter what she does afterward.”

Voters say Cheney was too focused on Trump

While Trump’s shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues — to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.

“I want Wyoming to be protected and I don’t feel Liz is doing that job,” said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.

For many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.

Esther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney “bailed on us when we need her the most.”

“They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,” Egan said. “She’s with Nancy Pelosi.”

Catherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump’s endorsement of her.

“I’m not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,” she said. “I didn’t like her voting against Trump. I’m very pro-Trump. I listen to him.”

Going down swinging

Cheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump’s impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”

The retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party’s leadership team.

That same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.

She followed the ouster by telling reporters, in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: “I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”

In July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.

As the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.

Trump’s biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.

For the most part, Trump’s efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.

As those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.

She has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP’s direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party’s leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

“We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before — and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,” Cheney said then. “And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.”

Weeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that she will “make a decision on 2024 down the road.”

In an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all — even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.

“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”

Even as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.

Her campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence.

What’s next

It didn’t take long for the outcome of Tuesday’s primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.

She told supporters that she’d won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and “could easily have done the same again.” But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud.

“That was a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.

“No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,” she said.

After a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what’s next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?

She did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called “The Great Task” — a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the “great task” facing the country. And on Wednesday morning, she told NBC’s “Today” show that she is “thinking about” running for president and will make a decision in “the coming months.”

In her election night speech, Cheney previewed a continued fight against Trump: “I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together.”

“I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic,” she added.

As she left the stage, Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” blared over the event’s speakers as the sun set over the Grand Teton mountain peak.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has lifted the temporary ban on poultry imports from Japan and Missouri in the United States due to resolved outbreaks of the avian virus.

In separate memorandum orders signed by then undersecretary for Operations Leocadio Sebastian on Aug. 12, the Department of Agriculture (DA) lifted the temporary importation ban on the two countries, which covered poultry meat, day-old chicks, eggs and semen.

The DA said based on respective final reports of the three countries to the World Animal Health Organization (WOAH), the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) events have already been closed and resolved.

“Based on the evaluation of the DA, the risk of contamination from importing poultry meat, day old chicks, eggs and semen is negligible,” the DA said in two separate memorandum orders.

The DA earlier issued a temporary ban on poultry imports from Japan in November 2021, due to an outbreak of HPAI in Yokote City in Akita Prefecture, Japan.

Meanwhile, in March, the DA issued a temporary ban on poultry imports from several US states, including Missouri due to reported cases of HPAI.

The ban also covered the states of South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa in the US.

Aside from Missouri, the temporary poultry imports ban remain.

“All import transactions of the above bird species shall be in accordance with existing rules and regulations of the DA,” Sebastian said in the recent memorandum orders.

“All orders, rules and regulations or parts thereof which are inconsistent with the provisions of this order are hereby repealed or amended accordingly,” he said.

The two memorandum orders were effective immediately.

In June, the DA also lifted the poultry import ban from four countries due to resolved HPAI cases.

https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2022/08/17/dgu-chicago-juvenile-justice-n61577,Defensive gun use highlights holes in Chicago's juvenile justice system,"I wish I could call Chicago’s juvenile justice system a joke, but unfortunately there’s nothing funny about an institution that’s such an utter failure at rehabilitating young offenders or providing any consequences for their crimes.

Carjackings are becoming increasingly common across the city; up 8% over the past year and much higher compared to what they were before the 2020 crime wave hit in earnest. Most of these carjackings are unsolved, but when police do make an arrest, more than half of those put in cuffs are juveniles. What happens after that? As the website CWB Chicago documents, not much.

A 17-year-old who shot a retired Chicago police officer during a carjacking attempt this week is on juvenile probation for carjacking—probation that he has twice violated by possessing stolen motor vehicles, according to prosecutors. Mareon Jones was ordered held without bail on Tuesday afternoon by Judge Maryam Ahmad. The 59-year-old retired cop was sitting in his Audi SUV in front of his home in the 3800 block of West Grenshaw on Sunday afternoon when Jones and another gunman arrived in a car driven by a third person, according to prosecutor Danny Hanichak. Jones and the other passenger allegedly got out and pointed two short rifles at the victim, Hanichak said. The second gunman demanded the man’s money, then started to return to their car after the victim told him he didn’t have any. The getaway car’s driver, however, instructed Jones and the other gunman to take the victim’s car, and Jones demanded the Audi’s keys at gunpoint, according to Hanichak. The retired officer moved behind the Audi, drew his weapon, and opened fire on Jones, hitting him at least once. Jones ran back to the getaway car while firing at the victim as the second gunman opened fire from the vehicle, Hanichak said. The victim, shot once in his abdomen and three times in the arm, underwent surgery and is expected to recover.

According to CWB Chicago, Jones was arrested and charged in February of 2020 with aggravated vehicular hijacking and ultimately received a sentence of four years probation. Since then, he’s been arrested twice for felony possession of stolen vehicles, but neither of those arrests led to his probation being revoked. Instead, both charges were apparently dismissed after Jones copped to violating his probation in March of this year. Rather than sending him away, the juvenile courts simply extended his probation for another four years, allowing him to continue on with his alleged life of crime.. at least until he and his buddies made the poor decision of targeting a victim who was able and ready to fight back in self-defense.

I think this teenager is old enough to make better decisions, but it doesn’t help that Chicago’s juvenile justice system is so apathetic to probation violations. If the purpose of the juvenile justice system is rehabilitation, and yet a juvenile offender who’s on probation keeps getting arrested for felony offenses, at what point does the system figure out that maybe the young offender needs more intensive supervision; the kind that’s supposed to be found in juvenile detention?

This isn’t an unusual case. In fact, according to a report by Chicago’s FOX 32 earlier this summer, teens and even pre-teens arrested for carjackings are generally back on the streets in short order.

“There’s only 20% of the cases where the individuals are being arrested,” said Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart. “So you don’t know who that other 80% is, in that 20% there’s a disproportionate number of juveniles involved in it.” Sheriff Dart says he’s frustrated with seeing repeat juvenile offenders. “If there is a carjacking, for example, and the juvenile is not going to be incarcerated while the case is being decided — definitely need to have home monitoring,” said Dart.

Home monitoring isn’t the answer either, thought it might be cheaper than keeping repeat offenders behind bars. Just a few weeks ago I ran across the case of Stephen Kelsey, a 24-year old convicted felon who’s now accused of committing a carjacking while on probation and electronic monitoring.

24-year old Steven Kelsey was convicted of his first felony as an adult back in 2015. As the website CWB Chicago reports, Kelsey was first charged with attempted murder before ultimately being convicted of illegal gun possession and aggravated discharge of a firearm. Placed on parole, Kelsey was soon arrested again on charges of unlawfully possessing a weapon as a felon. Remarkably, he was sent back to prison and wasn’t released until June of last year, when he posted a $10,000 bond and was allowed to return home as long as he was subject to electronic monitoring. For a little more than a year Kelsey managed to keep himself out of trouble, but according to prosecutors that all changed just a couple of weeks ago. … According to CWB Chicago, besides Kelsey’s adult felony convictions he also has three juvenile convictions to his name; two counts of possessing stolen vehicles and one conviction for aggravated vehicular hijacking. It’s unclear whether any of those charges resulted in him spending time behind bars as a juvenile, but for now he’s been ordered back to jail after having his parole revoked.

The names may change but the story remains the same. It’s not like Chicago politicians are going to change up their script either, which means that the number of city residents applying for and receiving their concealed carry license is only going to grow. The city’s criminal justice system is failing to protect its citizens, which makes it even more important that they have access to their Second Amendment right to protect themselves with a firearm.",Q3

NASA leaders are hopeful they can launch the Artemis 1 mission before the end of September. However, the Space Launch System rocket must first undergo repairs, and the U.S. Space Force would need to approve.

Most recently, NASA began fueling the Space Launch System rocket with the uncrewed Orion spacecraft during a countdown on Saturday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. However, a fuel leak of liquid hydrogen to the SLS caused the launch director to scrub the liftoff after engineers couldn't solve the problem in time.

NASA is attempting to launch the SLS and Orion on a test flight around the moon as the space agency prepares to launch astronauts on a similar mission next year and ultimately land humans on the moon for the first time in 50 years.

Technical issues caused two scrubs last week, first due to a sensor error on one of the rocket's four RS-25 engines on Aug. 29 and then a major liquid hydrogen leak on Saturday.

NASA associate administrator of exploration systems development Jim Free said the space agency is working to fix the leak and then conduct a test as soon as Sept. 17, fueling the rocket to check the seal.

If the test goes well, NASA has requested an extension from U.S. Space Force, which oversees the Eastern Range, to attempt a launch on Sept. 23 or Sept. 27.

Previously, NASA said the 322-foot-tall rocket would need to roll back to the Vehicle Assembly building due to safety requirements to replace the flight termination system (FTS) batteries. The flight termination system is required on all rockets and would cause the vehicle to self-destruct if it veers off course and threatens the public.

WHAT IS NASA'S ARTEMIS 1 MISSION GOING TO DO?

Free said the agency submitted a waiver to extend the FTS certification and is waiting to hear back from Space Force.

""We're pressing for the tanking test that's in our forefront,"" Free said. ""If the range has questions, obviously, we'd like to hear from them. But we're following their process. So right now, we submitted the waiver, and we'll look to hear from them on any clarifications that they need from us when we get closer to the tanking test. Obviously, we'll have to make a decision after that if we don't have a decision from the range.""

NASA's SLS chief engineer John Blevins said FTS batteries are located on each stage of the rocket, but the ""heart of the system"" is the bright orange core stage.

""The batteries in question, what we're talking about, are core stage batteries, they are different than the other systems and because of their size and that they're a little more prone to meeting that retest evaluation,"" Blevins said.

Free said NASA has been working with the Director of the Eastern Range, Brig. Gen. Stephen G. Purdy and his team ensuring all safety requirements and concerns are met.

Leaky hydrogen plagues SLS

The SLS requires more than 700,000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant to provide the fuel to lift the 322-foot-tall rocket off the launchpad and into space. While an efficient rocket fuel, hydrogen is a tiny molecule that easily leaks and also created problems for the space shuttle program.

SLS has also experienced hydrogen leaks during wet dress rehearsal tests and a small leak during the first launch attempt. NASA managers said the most recent leak was considered a major leak.

To fix the leak, engineers have built a plastic tent around the hardware to protect it from the elements as they replace several seals.

Mike Bolger, NASA Exploration Ground Systems program manager, said there is cooling for the team inside the enclosure to combat the Florida heat.

After completing the work, NASA will test the work by fueling the rocket with 700,000 gallons of minus-423-degree propellant.

Mike Bolger, NASA Exploration Ground Systems program manager, said they would fully tank both core stage and upper stage through all three phases of fueling, including slow fill, fast fill and replenish.

""We're really just trying to prove that we've got a good seal,"" Bolger said.

ARTEMIS DELAYED: HOW LONG DID IT TAKE NASA TO LAUNCH THE FIRST SPACE SHUTTLE IN COMPARISON?

Bolger said teams should replace an 8-inch seal by Thursday afternoon and then move on to a 4-inch seal later in the day if the weather allows.

Teams can work on the rocket even during a Phase 2 lightning storm because of the lightning protection system around the launchpad.

""The three 550-foot towers that we've got out and the catenary wire, so far has proven really effective in protecting the launch vehicle through a couple of tough storms where those towers did take strikes and again, protected the vehicle extremely well,"" Bolger said.

NASA's mega moon rocket has survived lightning strikes without issue, including the most powerful strike ever recorded at Kennedy Space Center.

Potential launch dates

NASA needs to consider the Earth and moon alignment and can only launch the SLS on select days. The next launch window opens in mid-September.

If the range approves NASA's extension, the Sept. 23 launch window opens at 6:47 a.m., and the Orion would splash down in the Pacific on Oct. 18. A Sept. 27 launch window would open at 11:37 a.m. with Orion's return on Nov. 5.

""We need to get the tanking test done, and then we'll have to look at what is the realism and schedule for us for the launch period,"" Free said.

Due to the upcoming SpaceX Crew-5 astronaut launch in early October, a mid-October launch is possible if NASA cannot launch by the end of September.

WYLIE, Texas — Hundreds of students, parents and teachers gathered outside of Davis Intermediate School in Wylie Tuesday night to remember a beloved educator after she was found shot to death in her own home.

According to police, 40-year-old Lacie Moore was found shot and killed alongside her husband in Josephine.

Police said she was the victim of a murder-suicide. The Josephine Chief of Police said that the shooting incident was isolated and that no suspects were at large. He added that an investigation into the shooting is ongoing.

Moore was an English/language arts teacher at Davis Intermediate School within Wylie ISD. Before that, she had taught for several years within Community ISD.

Not far from her Wylie classroom, students, families and teachers she left an impression on from this school year and previous ones gathered to mourn Tuesday night.

Hundreds gathered in the parking lot of Davis Intermediate to pray, lean on one another and remember the educator they loved.

Moore's principal, Cody Summers, told the crowd that Moore was a parent to so many children who weren't her own.

Moore leaves behind four kids who will now grow up without their mother or father.

""The first thing that came to mind when I thought about Lacie was her sense of humor. She loved TikTok,"" Summer said. ""But I also thought about how much she loved her children and her students.""

Sarah Kramer also spoke and shared anecdotes from those Moore helped.

Kramer told WFAA Monday night that Moore helped her son embrace and overcome challenging moments. The young man struggles with autism and ADHD.

""I was so lucky because she changed my life, and she changed my son's life,"" Kramer said.

Kramer echoed more praise about her friend Tuesday night.

""To know her was to love her, even if you tried not to, she wouldn't let you she tried so hard,"" Kramer told the crowd.

Everyone in the crowd was wearing Moore's favorite color: yellow.

Wylie ISD told WFAA that Moore's current students asked that their teacher's things on the wall be left alone for the remainder of the school year -- a sign that Moore is already so missed.

Moore's funeral will be held Saturday at 10 a.m. at the Cross Church in Wylie.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Industries continue to feel the pinch as it relates to staffing shortages, and law enforcement is no exception.

Between the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and the country's current social climate, more police agencies nationwide have been struggling with recruitment, including departments right here in Western New York.

Amherst Police Chief and veteran officer Scott P. Chamberlin said it hasn't been easy, especially since the department doesn't handle its own recruitment; Erie County does. As far as the Amherst Police Exam, there hasn't been a police test since before COVID.

""We're not at the number right now. But we have 159 strong, when we have all of our people. We're down quite a bit. We're down 11 or 12 right now,"" Chief Chamberlin said. ""We're controlled by Erie County. They have an exam every two or three years, and that's where we get our candidates from, so we can't recruit individual people. We just have to, you know, try to do as much awareness as we can.""

Over in Buffalo, the police department is also facing some staffing challenges.

G.G. Herndon-Hill is the commissioner of human resources and says new recruitment efforts haven't started yet, because the city is still working from its current list, which expires in September of 2023. That said, Herndon-Hill told 2 On Your Side's Liz Lewin that given the turnout for the fire exam, there are some concerns.

""Currently, there are about approximately 713 active officers, and there are 10 exempt employees. I would say as far as the openings, the vacancies, there's about 40,"" Herndon-Hill said. ""The numbers are not the way they were before. People are really weighing, I think, the danger of the job.""

Bottom line: Times have changed, which means recruitment efforts are as well.

""We will be working very hard, very diligently to encourage people who don't normally think about this as a career path, to think about it to consider it,"" Herndon-Hill said.

According to the Police Executive Research Forum, also known as PERF, between 2020 and 2021, there were three major reasons police departments in the United States saw a drop in sworn officers:

hiring has been modest, at best;

an increase in resignations; and

an even bigger increase in retirements.

So, what are local police departments doing to address this?

On Monday, July 11, Amherst, Kenmore, Cheektowaga, Lockport, Lancaster, Tonawanda Police and New York State Police are hosting a joint department recruitment event from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Amherst Police Community Policing and Training Facility.

The organization has traveled all over Indiana for these rallies leading up to July 25, when state lawmakers are scheduled to meet to address abortion laws.

The event lasted just over an hour and a half Friday evening. There were about 50 supporters gathered in the plaza lawn and another handful listening from their cars in the parking lot due to the light drizzle.

“The unanimous cry from the people here was obvious: They’re looking for a stop to abortion here in Indiana as well,” Schrock said. “That’s why they rallied with us here tonight because they wanted to know what they can do.”

https://www.foxnews.com/us/pike-county-massacre-trial-star-witness-he-executed-two-nursing-mothers,'Pike County Massacre' trial: star witness says he executed two nursing mothers,"Jurors heard shocking new details Monday about the ""Pike County Massacre"" when four members of one family murdered eight members of a rival family in southern Ohio in a dispute over custody of a little girl.

Edward ""Jake"" Wagner fatally shot two nursing mothers as they slept in their beds in the grisly ambush of the Rhoden family in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, prosecutor Angela Canepa told juror in opening statements at his brother and alleged co-conspirator's murder trial.

Jake Wagner pleaded guilty last year and is a key witness expected to testify against his brother, George Wagner IV, 30, who is the first defendant in the case to go to trial for the 2016 slayings.



The brothers and their parents, Angela and George ""Billy"" Wagner III, were charged with conspiring to methodically execute eight members of the Rhoden family at three trailers and one camper on a sprawling rural property outside Piketon.

After blasting Hanna Rhoden, 19, in the head twice, Jake Wagner ""rearranged her body on her bed so her four-day-old infant Kylie ""could nurse if she wanted,"" the prosecutor told jurors.

Hanna Rhoden was the main target of the rampage. When Jake Wagner was 20 years old, he conceived a child with the then-15-year-old.

After she left Jake Wagner and the clutches of his controlling family, she refused to hand over custody of their daughter, Sophie, who was 3 at the time, according to prosecutors.

""They will have to kill me first,"" she told a friend on Facebook — and three months later that’s exactly what they did, Canepa told jurors.

Jake Wagner also shot Hanna Rhoden’s mother, Dana Rhoden, 37, and her little brother, 16-year-old Chris Rhoden Jr.

At another trailer down the road, Jake Wagner allegedly blasted Hannah Gilley, 20, five times in the head and face, and her fiancé, Frankie Rhoden, as their six-month-old son, Ruger, nuzzled in between them.

""[Hannah Gilley] apparently had been nursing Ruger at the time of her death because of the way the clothing was situated, and Ruger was still laying between them covered in his parents' blood,"" Canepa said.

The victims also included Hanna Rhoden’s father, Christopher Rhoden, Sr., 40, Christopher Rhoden's brother Kenneth Rhoden, 44, and cousin Gary Rhoden, 38.

After Jake Wagner pleaded guilty last year and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for life in prison, Angela Wagner followed suit.

She pleaded guilty to helping plan the murder — which she was not present for — and agreed to testify against her husband and son in exchange for a recommended prison term of 30 years.

If Angela and Jake Wagner testify to the satisfaction of the prosecution, the death penalty will be taken off the table for all four defendants.

Joe Nathan James Jr. received a lethal injection at a south Alabama prison after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his request for a stay.

James was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1994 shooting death of Faith Hall, 26, in Birmingham. Hall's daughters have said they would rather James serve life in prison, but Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Wednesday that she planned to let the execution proceed.

Prosecutors said James briefly dated Hall and he became obsessed after she rejected him, stalking and harassing her for months before killing her. On Aug. 15, 1994, after Hall had been out shopping with a friend, James forced his way inside the friend's apartment, pulled a gun from his waistband and shot Hall three times, according to court documents.

A Jefferson County jury first convicted James of capital murder in 1996 and voted to recommend the death penalty, which a judge imposed. The conviction was overturned when a state appeals court ruled a judge had wrongly admitted some police reports into evidence. James was retried and again sentenced to death in 1999, when jurors rejected defense claims that he was under emotional duress at the time of the shooting.

Hall’s two daughters, who were 3 and 6 when their mother was killed, had said recently that they would rather James serve life in prison. The family members issued a statement Thursday saying they will not attend the execution.

“Today is a tragic day for our family. We are having to relive the hurt that this caused us many years ago,"" the statement issued through state Rep. Juandalynn Givan's office read. Givan was a friend of Hall's.

""We hoped the state wouldn’t take a life simply because a life was taken and we have forgiven Mr. Joe Nathan James Jr. for his atrocities toward our family. ... We pray that God allows us to find healing after today and that one day our criminal justice system will listen to the cries of families like ours even if it goes against what the state wishes,"" the family's statement read.

Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall had urged Ivey to let the execution go forward, writing that “it is our obligation to ensure that justice is done for the people of Alabama.”

“The jury in James’s case unanimously decided that his brutal murder of Faith Hall warranted a sentence of death,” Marshall said.

In response to a reporter's question, Ivey said Wednesday that she would not intervene.

“My staff and I have researched all the records and all the facts and there’s no reason to change the procedure or modify the outcome. The execution will go forward,"" she said.

James argued that Ivey's refusal violates religious freedom laws because the Koran and the Bible “place the concept of forgiveness paramount in this situation.”

James acted as his own attorney in his bid to stop his execution, mailing handwritten lawsuits and appeal notices to the courts from death row. A lawyer filed the latest appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court on his behalf Wednesday. But the request for a stay was rejected about 30 minutes before the execution was set to begin.

James asked justices for a stay, noting the opposition of Hall's family and arguing that Alabama did not give inmates adequate notice of their right to select an alternate execution method.

The state argued that James waited too late to begin trying to postpone his execution and “should not be rewarded for his transparent attempt to game the system."" While the feelings of the victim's family deserve to be considered, it said, they aren't reason for a court to delay the execution.

James argued that after lawmakers approved nitrogen hypoxia as a new execution method, Alabama officials gave inmates only a brief window of time to select the new method and inmates did not know what was at stake when they were handed a selection form without any explanation. Alabama is not scheduling executions for inmates who selected nitrogen. The state has not developed a system for using nitrogen to carry out death sentences.",Q3

“His actions were nothing short of heroic. He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun. Was very proficient in that, was tactically sound and as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning for people to exit behind him,” said Greenwood Police Chief Jim Ison, according to WTHR. “Many people would have died last night if not for a responsible, armed citizen that took action very quickly within the first two minutes of this shooting.”

Ison had released a public statement on Tuesday confirming Dicken had stopped the massacre in just 15 seconds, not two minutes as first reported.

As police evacuated the mall, Dicken’s girlfriend Shay Goldman contacted her grandmother and told her that Dicken protected her from the mass shooter.

“I just know when I got the phone call that she was at the mall, I was scared. She says ‘Grandma I’m OK, but I’m terrified,’ and then she says, ‘Grandma what is the world coming to?’ And she says ‘I don’t think I’ll ever step foot in a mall again,'” the grandmother told WTHR.

“I just know that I’m so proud of him for what he’s done. He saved my granddaughter. I know he did,” she continued. “She said on the phone when she called me, ‘Grandma, I’m OK. Eli pushed me out of the way and told me to get down and stay down,’ and everybody should be proud of him for what he’s done because if not, there would have been a lot more.”

Police said Dicken learned how to shoot from his grandfather, and according to Goldman’s grandmother, she also helped during the terrifying ordeal.

“[Shay Goldman] has been in nursing school for two years. She said she took her coat off and put a tourniquet around it and waited,” her grandmother explained. “She jumped in and went into action, yeah, and it’s just her adrenaline mode to just do that.”

“I’m glad they’re both OK and I’m glad he did what he did, but we need prayers for him. He needs prayers because that’s…to take somebody’s life is hard,” she added. “Just please let’s pray for them. That’s what we need is to pray. And pray for this world!”

Dicken’s attorney Guy A. Relford said in a statement that Dicken is waiting to speak about the shooting to respect those who were killed. According to the Washington Examiner, police identified the victims as: Victor Gomez, 30; Pedro Pineda, 56; and Rosa Mirian Rivera de Pineda, 37.

“I am proud to serve as Eli Dicken’s attorney and spokesperson. He is a true American hero who saved countless lives during a horrific event that could have been so much worse if not for Eli’s courage, preparedness and willingness to protect others,” the statement read.

“Because we want to respect the ongoing criminal investigation by the Greenwood Police Department and take time to honor the three innocent lives lost, we won’t be making any substantive comments on Sunday’s events until after the authorities’ investigation is closed. In the interim, we ask that you respect the privacy of Eli and his family.”",Q3

Bloomingdale’s, which is owned by Macy’s Inc., announced Aug. 25 it would cease operations at its longstanding store at Old Orchard and would open its second-in-the-nation Bloomie’s concept store there.

“We’re excited to be opening our second Bloomie’s location,” Bloomingdale’s Director of Stores Charles Anderson said in a statement. “The new concept remains authentic to the Bloomingdale’s brand yet reinterprets it on a smaller scale that is infused with energy and ripe for discovery.”

The Bloomingdale’s department store at the Westfield Old Orchard Shopping Center is closing.

Len Becker, Skokie’s Economic Development Manager, said he was not surprised by the announcement of the big box retail closing, conceding the continuing trend toward online shopping.

Becker added the village is glad to see the continued presence Bloomingdale’s will maintain at Old Orchard, albeit in a different form.

“We are pleased with the fact that Macy’s corporation is opening the second Bloomie’s concept in Skokie at Old Orchard,” Becker said. “The Bloomie’s concept is really a refresh and it will create an exciting buzz.”

The first Bloomie’s opened in Fairfax, Virginia last year, according to the company.

The Bloomingdale’s statement said Bloomie’s will feature soft home categories.

A company spokesman wrote in an email to Pioneer Press that additional details about the specific merchandise available at Bloomie’s would be made public in October.

Meanwhile, the roughly 200,000-square-foot Bloomingdale’s department store in Old Orchard is expected to close by October, with a clearance sale starting Sept. 6, the company announced.

It is not certain what the future holds for the three-story, high-end Bloomingdale’s store. A spokeswoman for Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which owns Westfield Old Orchard, deferred questions to the Bloomingdale’s spokesman.

The Bloomingdale’s department store at the Westfield Old Orchard Shopping Center is closing.

The company did not indicate a specific location in the shopping center for the Bloomie’s store, but Becker said he thought it would go into the space formerly occupied by a Barnes & Noble bookstore.

Becker acknowledged that many large retail stores are closing around the nation.

“There are not a lot of tenants looking for 150,000 to 200,000 square feet anymore,” he said. “Macy’s and a lot of the other traditional department stores are looking at smaller concepts and bringing them closer to the customer and creating that new buzz and experience that consumers are really craving.”

Becker anticipated the current Bloomingdale’s store would be redeveloped into one with multiple potential users, similar in nature to the anticipated changes for the mall’s Lord & Taylor store which closed in 2018.

“That has been the case with shopping centers around the world,” he said.

Earlier this year, the Skokie village board implemented an additional one percent sales tax at Old Orchard.

Becker said he did not think the added sales tax played a factor in Macy’s decision to close the store.

“I think it is about profitability,” he said. “Each market is very different and they evolve over time. These bigger department store boxes aren’t feasible to operate anymore.”

https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/07/18/robert-gould-shaw-sword,Famous Civil War Sword Belonging To Robert Gould Shaw Found In Attic,"Col. Robert Gould Shaw was the commanding officer of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the first all-black regiment to fight for the Union during the Civil War. The story is told in the 1989 film ""Glory,"" with Matthew Broderick playing the role of Shaw.

Shaw led his men in a charge against the Confederates holding Fort Wagner in South Carolina on July 18, 1863. It was a deadly and ultimately unsuccessful assault. More than 70 enlisted men and three officers from the 54th, including Shaw, were killed. The Rebels held the fort.

When Shaw was killed, he was carrying a brand-new sword that had been specially made for him by the English sword maker Henry Wilkinson.

""That was the Rolls-Royce of swords at the time,"" says Anne Bentley, a curator at the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston. ""And it was a very, very expensive and very valuable gift, and anyone who depended on a sword in war wanted a Wilkinson sword, so it was a generous gift from his uncle.""

Shaw had only received the sword a couple of weeks before the battle of Fort Wagner. He had written to his father, ""a box of Uncle George's containing a beautiful English sword came all right.""

After Shaw fell, the sword was taken from his body. Bentley says a Confederate soldier probably sold it to an officer. But in 1865, a Union general named Charles Jackson Paine got word of it when he and his soldiers — some African-American — were camped near Goldsboro, North Carolina.

""Somebody came out of the house and asked if any of the black soldiers had been part of Shaw's regiment, because Shaw's sword was in a house in the neighborhood,"" Bentley says.

So Paine sent some of his men to retrieve it. Eventually the sword was returned to the Shaw family. It then went to Shaw's sister, Susanna Shaw Minturn.

""It was given to my father years ago, I think when he was a child, by his great-grandmother, Susanna Shaw Minturn,"" says Mary Wood Minturn. ""My family never spoke about it. I never knew anything about it.""

At least she didn't until a couple of years ago, when she and other members of her family were cleaning out their parents' home north of Boston, before they sold it. They actually found several swords in the attic. But Wood says one of them stood out.

""So we looked at it a little more closely, and discovered that it was very nicely engraved with the American flag, and on the other side it had the initials 'R.G.S.,'"" Wood says. ""That's when we knew, 'This is a special sword.'""

Needless to say they didn't put this sword out for the tag sale. But they did have to decide what to do with it.

""Well first of all my daughter said it should be kept in the family, and I said, 'What part of the family? We're just a small section. It should be shared with the world. It should be on display, and the right thing to do is to donate it.' So that's what we did.""

Now the sword is part of the collection at the Massachusetts Historical Society, where it's on display for the first time. Bentley says when she holds the sword, she feels it represents more than simply a weapon of war. It's a link to something bigger.

""For me it's more the symbol that the sword is, rather than the object itself,"" Bentley says. ""Because it represents not just Robert Gould Shaw, but it represents the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes and the sacrifices of all the men in the regiment.""

The bravery displayed by the African-American soldiers from the Massachusetts 54th on July 18, 1863, was enough to convince Congress that African-Americans could be soldiers. So lawmakers authorized more black regiments, and by the end of the war more than 180,000 African-Americans had served. The 54th served with distinction until the end of the war.

President Lincoln credited the regiment, and the other African-Americans who fought for the Union, with helping win the Civil War.",Q3
https://www.freepressjournal.in/world/the-satanic-verses-why-salman-rushdies-controversial-novel-is-banned-in-india,The Satanic Verses: Why Salman Rushdie's controversial novel is banned in India,"The Satanic Verses is the fourth novel written by Mumbai-born British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie |

Booker Prize winning author Salman Rushdie, whose novel The Satanic Verses drew death threats from Iran’s leader in the 1980s, was stabbed in the neck and abdomen on Friday by a man who rushed to the stage as the author was about to give a lecture in western New York.

In India, the legal term used for banning a book is ""forfeiture"".

It is defined under Section 95 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which every copy of the book could be declared ""to be forfeited to government"" and the police might therefore ""seize the same wherever found in India.""

On October 5, 1988, just ten days after its publication, India became the first country to ban The Satanic Verses.

Which Indian government banned the book?

Khushwant Singh, while reviewing the book in Illustrated Weekly, proposed a ban on The Satanic Verses, apprehending the reaction it may evoke among people.

On October 5, 1988, India banned the novel's importation, after Indian parliamentarian and editor of the monthly magazine Muslim India Syed Shahabuddin petitioned the government of then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to ban the book.

K Natwar Singh, who was a Union minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government that banned The Satanic Verses, strongly defended the decision on Saturday, following the attack on Rushdie, asserting that it was taken ""purely"" for law and order reasons.

With focus back on Rushdie's book in the wake of the attack on him in New York, Singh, who was the minister of state for external affairs when the book was banned in 1988, said he was part of the decision and had told the then prime minister the book could cause serious law and order problems as feelings were running very high.

Singh, 91, rejected as ""rubbish"" the charge by critics the Rajiv Gandhi government's decision to ban the book was driven by appeasement towards Muslims.

""I don't think it (the decision to ban the book) was wrong because you see it had led to law and order problems, particularly in Kashmir. In other parts of India also there was disquiet,"" Singh told PTI.

""Rajiv Gandhi asked me what should be done. I said, 'all my life I have been totally opposed to banning books but when it comes to law and order even a book of a great writer like Rushdie should be banned',"" the diplomat-turned-politician said.

Was preservation of communal harmony in the government's decision?

Yes.

Violence was threatened. The matter was referred to the then-Home Minister, Buta Singh. The Home Ministry recommended that the book should not be published because its distribution would lead to violence.

The government of India accepted this recommendation and banned the import of The Satanic Verses. Rajiv Gandhi justified his decision by saying that nothing could be allowed to cause riots and endanger communal harmony.

Violence erupted in Mumbai... and elsewhere

On the 24th of February, 1989, barely 10 days after the infamous fatwa of apostasy delivered against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, 12 people were killed in police firing in Bombay, as Mumbai was then known.

The police was apparently forced to open fire when a crowd of around 10,000 Muslims protesting outside the British Consulate in the city began to turn violent.

On February 13 of the same year, one person was killed and over 100 injured in anti-Rushdie riots in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.

The violence was not limited to India.

One February 12 of that year, six people were killed and 100 injured when 10,000-strong mob attacked the American Cultural Center in Islamabad, Pakistan, protesting against Rushdie and his book.

On July 2, 1993, thirty-seven Turkish intellectuals and locals participating in the Pir Sultan Abdal Literary Festival died when the conference hotel in Sivas, Turkey, was burnt down by a mob of radical Islamists.

Participating in the conference was Aziz Nesin, who had previously announced that he was going to get the book translated and published. The mob demanded he be handed over for summary execution. The mob set the hotel alight when Nesin was not turned over. Nesin escaped the fire and survived.",Q3
https://www.theepochtimes.com/the-real-story-of-christopher-columbus_4729311.html,The Real Story of Christopher Columbus,"Commentary

One of the most notable attacks from the political left is on American history, with the 1619 Project, the criticism of America’s historical figures, and the defamation and accusations against historical people and events. Thankfully, knowledge is power, and with the proper knowledge of true American history, Americans can stand in the way of leftist lies meant to deceive the next generation and tear down the United States.

In this EpochTV episode, host Timothy Barton, president of WallBuilders, and Jonathan Richie, assistant director of the American Journey Experience, sit among 160,000 items and artifacts from American history and tell the true story of Columbus, which runs very differently from what the political left would have Americans believe. Together, they address a rewriting of American history that ignores the existence of documents and artifacts to tell a story that Barton says may be more “politically motivated than historically honest.”

What most people know about Columbus is that in 1492, he “sailed the ocean blue.” However, there is much more to his story. Today, many people are critical of Columbus. What many don’t know is that he sailed four voyages to America, and each one was very different. So if indeed he was evil, which voyage was he evil on? “If you don’t know the story of the voyages, how do you even know he was bad in the first place?” Barton asks. Why Did Columbus Sail to America? Columbus lived in Spain, while the country was struggling to reestablish itself after the various wars and conflicts of those days. Because of the conflicts, the trade routes to get to India had been shut off, causing people in the West to look for other options to get to India over land. While many pursued new routes, Columbus took to the history and science books dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, developing an idea that they could sail across the Atlantic and eventually reach India. Given the knowledge of the earth and the world at that time, this was an impressive plan he formulated. Technically, he did not discover America—there had been Vikings who had landed there, among others—however, in the Western world, no one had accomplished what Columbus did or documented it so well. The First Voyage: Columbus Makes Friends With the Natives Columbus’s first voyage he believed was to India, but he instead landed in northcentral and south America. He moved from island to island, encountered some of the natives there, and tried to communicate with them. Richie says this is one of the most significant moments in world history because it begins the process of the Old World and the New World coming together. They discovered a world untouched by outside societies for hundreds if not thousands of years. Columbus was an Italian but was funded by Spain, therefore sailing for Spain. The hosts show the document with the signatures from the queen and king of Spain paying Columbus to go on his voyage. He journals and documents the culture and customs of the tribes he had met and become friends with, and wrote very highly of them, saying “a better race there cannot be on earth.” This does not go along with the narrative that he was a racist genocidal figure.

Things did go awry, however. Columbus was sent with three ships, but one ship was lost. The tribes helped save the crew, but not all the crew fit on the two ships, which led them to leave some of the crew behind. The native tribe tells Columbus that they aren’t the only tribe on the island. They warned of another very warlike tribe, which would raid their villages, steal their men and women, and also were cannibals, eating the people they captured and enslaving the rest. Columbus was skeptical of this, thinking the world to be more civilized than that. So he left, returned to Spain, and began preparing for a second voyage. This was more of a colonizing voyage, meant to establish a trading post and find the mainland, as well as rescue the men they had left behind.

The 2nd Voyage: Columbus’s Men Get Eaten Upon Columbus’s return, they found the men they left behind, but they did not find them alive. Instead, they discovered bodies that had been cannibalized. Outraged, Columbus and his men were ready to go to war to defend the honor of the men who had been eaten. Their native friends asked to create a coalition force and go with them because one of the king’s wives had been stolen and another killed by the cannibal tribe. They sailed out, found the tribe, and defeated them in battle. Columbus enslaved some of the captives and sent them back to Spain. This instance is where Columbus is often painted as a slave trader, but Richie says you have to contextualize it. In the 1400s, after a war where you conquered a people group, there were two main options: you could kill all the people you defeated, or enslave them. The cannibal tribe would have a third option where you would eat some of the people. The only natives Columbus ever approved of enslaving were natives he had conquered in a justified war, where his men had been attacked and eaten, and that he had fought with his allies who were other native Americans.

The only natives Columbus ever approved of enslaving were natives he had conquered in a justified war, where his men had been attacked and eaten, and that he had fought with his allies who were other native Americans.

The 3rd Voyage: Trouble in the Ranks On the third voyage, Columbus found that the Spanish he had left on the second voyage were in full revolt against him and did not want to be told what to do anymore. These men were not missionaries trying to cultivate or convert the native tribes, they were Spaniards who wanted to take the wealth and resources of the native lands. Columbus had put policies in place saying they could not take from the natives without giving something of value in return, and many did not like this. Columbus also found the Spaniards doing other bad things, such as enslaving and killing some of the natives. When he put a stop to it, the Spanish got upset and sent word to the king and queen accusing Columbus of being a tyrant and of doing the very things they were doing. So, the king and queen sent someone to investigate and get to the bottom of what was happening. Upon arrival, this person found Spaniards who had been hung for their crimes against the natives. This person put Columbus in chains and sent them back to Spain to stand trial before the king and queen. Interestingly, the only people the investigator had interviewed were the Spaniards who were revolting against Columbus. In Columbus’s trial, he was able to tell the other side of the story, and upon hearing all the information, was exonerated of every charge against him. Reinstituted of his titles, Columbus was sent on another voyage. The 4th Voyage: Shipwrecked On the fourth voyage, Columbus was shipwrecked for over a year. The Spanish ignored his request for aid due to the previous tensions, but eventually, Columbus got back to the colonies and returns to Spain. Barton notes that all this information is laid out in detail and footnoted in the book “The American Story,” which is available on the Wallbuilders website. The EpochTV episode notes that Columbus did not turn on the natives but that he and other natives conquered this particular tribe. Interestingly, the tribe Columbus conquered (the Carib) is also a well-documented historical tribe, known for their horrific practices towards conquered people, such as castrating infants and fattening them like animals, then eating them. The Carib would keep women to be slaves or rape them, and any children born from the captives would be eaten. This was shocking and evil to Columbus and his men.On the third voyage, Columbus found that the Spanish he had left on the second voyage were in full revolt against him and did not want to be told what to do anymore.

“So here’s the reality: There’s a lot more to the story than we hear most of the time,” says Barton. He encourages people to refer to the original historical documents, which can be done by following along with this three-part series on EpochTV . “We as a people need to stop trusting what somebody else tells us and we have to do the research for ourselves,” says Barton.

Daniel Palmer, 55, remained in a Jefferson County jail on Monday, charged with the attempted murder and malicious wounding of his sister, Wanda Palmer, two years ago, officials said.

She awoke from her coma last month and eventually identified Daniel Palmer as the person who beat her on June 10, 2020, leading to Daniel Palmer's arrest last week, court records showed.

Wanda Palmer was found severely beaten in her trailer just outside of Cottageville, so badly bludgeoned and covered in blood that responding officers assumed she was mortally injured, according to a complaint.

Wanda Palmer. Jackson County WV Sheriff's Office

“Wanda, while breathing, was making this sound commonly referred to as the ‘death rattle,’"" the complaint said, citing colloquial language for the final coughing sounds a person may make moments from death.

She was taken to a hospital and remained in that comatose state for two years — until miraculously beginning to regain some consciousness last month.

Deputy H.L. Faber, on June 27, ""was informed by the worker that Wanda Palmer had begun to utter some single words and seemed to appropriately respond when questioned,"" the complaint said.

""Wanda indicated [that] she recalled living in her trailer near her mother's place. She indicated she recalled being hurt there,"" the report added.

""She made mention of her head (the area of her body where she was injured). When asked who had wounded her she [stated] her brother. She then identified her brother as Daniel. When asked why Daniel assaulted her, Wanda stated that he was mean.""

Court records on Monday did not show Daniel Palmer as having retained an attorney yet. He was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail.

Palmer made his initial court appearance on Friday and became combative, forcing multiple deputies to drag him out of the courthouse.

Palmer has long denied any involvement in his sister's beating.

Investigators said the brother had always been a person of interest and that a witness stated ""that he saw Daniel Palmer in the front doorway at Wanda's trailer at midnight on the night she was assaulted,"" according to the complaint.

Still, that account was not enough to have Palmer arrested until last week.

""Wanda Palmer, during the brief interview, appeared oriented to her situation,"" the complaint said. ""Her [answers] to questions were coherent and relevant. She asked for prayer.""",Q3
https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan6-donald-trump-justice-department-investigation-merrick-garland-1385490/,"Running for President Won’t Save Trump from Jan. 6 Investigation, Justice Department Says","The Justice Department will continue investigating Donald Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack even if he runs for reelection, a department official said Tuesday.

“We’re going to continue to do our job, to follow the facts wherever they go, no matter where they lead, no matter to what level,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, according to a Bloomberg report. “We’re going to continue to investigate what was fundamentally an attack on our democracy.”

Rolling Stone reported Sunday that Trump has been telling associates that his desire to be president again stems in part from a desire to thwart criminal investigations against him. “He says when [not if] he is president again, a new Republican administration will put a stop to the [Justice Department] investigation that he views as the Biden administration working to hit him with criminal charges — or even put him and his people in prison,” a source with knowledge of the situation said.

In a press conference on Wednesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland emphatically stated that “no person is above the law in this country.” He repeated himself when asked if that statement included “a former president.”

Attorney General Merrick Garland on possibility of charging a former president related to January 6th: ""No person is above the law in this country."" pic.twitter.com/1GAt7aJRFi — CSPAN (@cspan) July 20, 2022

Winning the White House would give Trump renewed power over the Justice Department and protect him from its investigations, as department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Simply declaring oneself a candidate, however, does not confer any automatic protections.

Investigating a presidential candidate has vexed federal law enforcement before, as agencies have tried to walk a line between upholding the law and avoiding the influence of political interference. During the 2016 election, the FBI and Justice Department took pains to keep quiet about the extent of their investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russian operatives.

But with regard to the Jan. 6 investigation, Monaco said, the department would not let a potential Trump candidacy deter them from investigating the insurrection to the fullest. “The mandate the team has remains, which is to follow the facts wherever they go, regardless of what level, regardless of whether the subject of those investigations were present on Jan. 6,” she said.

The announcement days hours after an internal DOJ memo was released by Rachel Maddow on Tuesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland indicated that his personal approval would be required for investigations of presidential candidates in the 2024 election, citing “election year sensitivities.”

The practice outlined by Garland is not new, it was initially instituted by Trump’s attorney general Bill Barr, largely as a measure to counteract potential investigations by the department that could damage Trump politically. Trump’s criminal exposure spans both state and federal investigations, some of which were stalled throughout his presidency as there is very little precedent for the pursuing of criminal complaints against a sitting president.",Q3
https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/who-alice-roosevelt-longworth-white-house-wild-child-washington-historian,"Who is Alice Roosevelt Longworth? White House wild child and original ‘wit of Washington,’ says historian","The U.S. has had its fair share of rebel teens in history, but an original American wild child grew up in the White House.

Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the eldest daughter of 26th President Theodore Roosevelt, was of fascination to the entire nation and remains so to this day.

Beautiful, intelligent, hilarious and outspoken, Longworth was coined the ""original wit of Washington"" by presidential historian and Reagan biographer Craig Shirley.

ROBERT MESNIER, WHITE HOUSE PASTRY CHEF FOR FIVE PRESIDENTS, PASSES AWAY AT 78

""Nobody has even come close to Alice Roosevelt Longworth [in history],"" Shirley said in a video interview with Fox News Digital.

Longworth, nicknamed ""Princess Alice,"" reportedly nagged at her father for wanting to be ""the bride at every wedding, the baby at every baptism and the corpse at every funeral.""

""But, of course, she loved attention, too,"" Shirley said.

Longworth made a name for herself due to her shocking antics, such as carrying around a pet boa constrictor named Emily Spinach — often worn around her neck — and for smoking on the roof of the White House.

""She had no filter and she didn’t care. And she did it with wit and verve.""

At 17 years old, she became a media spectacle for racing her car up and down the streets of Washington, chewing gum, playing poker, wearing pants, sleeping until noon and partying all night long with the Vanderbilts, according to All That's Interesting.

Her behavior shocked the public, as these tendencies were something presidential daughters of the early 20th century — or women, period — simply didn’t do.

""She broke the mold and then split it into a million pieces,"" Shirley told Fox News Digital.

""Presidential families, and especially daughters, were supposed to be quiet and low key and polite — and she was none of them.""

Shirley explained that Longworth was the first to say ""whatever was on her mind"" and even kept a pillow with a needle-point message that read, ""If you haven’t got anything nice to say about anyone, come and sit here by me.""

""She had no filter and she didn’t care,"" he said. ""And she did it with wit and verve.""

When concerns were brought to the president’s attention about his carefree daughter, Teddy Roosevelt famously admitted that he could not control Alice and run the country at the same time.

While some of the public despised her antics, much of the nation adored its casual first daughter.

Yet Longworth didn’t care either way, according to Shirley.

""She was in the newspapers all the time,"" he said. ""She was a gossip.""

""She was not only the original TMZ — she was probably the inspiration for TMZ.""

Shirley mentioned that Longworth’s erratic behavior was always accompanied with class and elegance, including her ability to ""cut down a man as soon as look at him.""

""She had no precepts against hurling insults against her opponent, or some of her friends, for that matter.""

‘Already a handful’

Longworth was born on Feb. 12, 1884, by virtue of Teddy Roosevelt’s first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, who died two days after their daughter was born.

Roosevelt’s own mother died that same day.

ON YELLOWSTONE'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY, 150 FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT AMERICA'S FIRST NATIONAL PARK

Torn with grief, Roosevelt spent two years exploring the mountain west region of the U.S. as a cowboy, Shirley noted.

""That’s where he learned a lot about life and it helped prepare him to become the president,"" he said.

During this time, a young Alice lived with her aunt, Anna Roosevelt, until her father got remarried — to Edith Kermit Carow in 1886.

Longworth was first introduced to the White House at 17 years old in 1901, the year her father was elected commander-in-chief. Throughout her father's years as president (1901-1909), Longworth grew her reputation for antics and for being naturally outspoken.

But Shirley said the first daughter was born with rebellious tendencies.

""She was already a handful,"" he said. ""[Roosevelt] never complained about his other children, but he was honest and frank about Alice — she was a handful.""

Longworth's behavior has been pinned to the early 20th century suffrage movement, as a reaction to America's changing perspective of womanhood.

Wedding bells

Alice Roosevelt married House Speaker Nicholas Longworth, R-Ohio, on Feb. 17, 1906, according to the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University.

The wedding ceremony took place in the East Room of the White House.

The couple's marriage lasted 25 years until Nicholas Longworth died in 1931.

When asked if she’d like to be buried next to her husband in Ohio, Alice responded that it would be a ""fate worse than death,"" according to Shirley.

Roosevelt Longworth only had one child in 1925 — a child conceived in an alleged affair with Sen. William Borah, R-Idaho.

The illegitimate daughter, Paulina Longworth Sturm, had nothing of her mother’s outspoken energy.

""She was actually meek and mild and very, very polite,"" Shirley said. ""She was nothing like her mother.""

Banned from White House

Even after Teddy Roosevelt left the White House, Longworth continued to wreak havoc on Washington, according to accounts.

Longworth was kicked out of the Woodrow Wilson White House for ""making cracks"" about the 28th president at his expense, according to Shirley, and for burying a voodoo doll of first lady Edith Wilson on the White House lawn.

She was also banned for smoking in the White House, which infuriated her; she even launched a one-woman lobbying campaign against Wilson’s League of Nations proposal.

""And she may have sunk it to defeat just by her own efforts,"" Shirley said.

Longworth had a five-story mansion on Massachusetts Avenue; various lawmakers and politicians would visit and try to court her, Shirley said.

She kept a close relationship with Richard Nixon and remained in the news until at least his second term as president.

""If she was president, she either would’ve been impeached or she would’ve been on Mount Rushmore,"" Shirley commented.

The first daughter went on to write an autobiography in 1933 called ""Crowded Hours,"" airing out the dirty political laundry of her time.

Greene County Circuit Court Judge Calvin Holden found Rebecca Ruud not guilty of first- and second-degree murder, tampering with evidence and felony abuse or neglect of a child but found her guilty on the remaining charge, illegally abandoning a corpse. The charges stemmed from the July 2017 death of 16-year-old Savannah Leckie, whose remains were found in a burn pit on Ruud’s remote property near the Arkansas-Missouri border.

According to the Law & Crime Network, Ruud had requested a bench trial instead of placing her fate in the hands of a jury. Closing arguments in the trial wrapped on June 30 and Holden returned a verdict on Friday – 29 days later, according to the report.

Ruud is scheduled to be sentenced on the last charge Sept. 15 by Holden, who heard the case instead of a jury in Springfield after a change of venue from Ozark County to the southwest. Ruud could get up to four years in prison.

The video and audio recordings of the incident as well as an examination of evidence by the South Dakota Forensic Laboratory corroborated the findings of DCI investigators and troopers’ accounts that they faced clear and present danger and that there was danger to the public, according to the release.

“This was a fast moving and tense situation that included high speed pursuit during which a crime suspect fired a weapon at Troopers,” said Vargo. “There was a clear danger to the Troopers and the public and the Troopers’ use of lethal force was warranted.”

What led up to the shooting?

On July 14, members of the Sioux Falls Area Drug Task Force requested assistance from the South Dakota Highway Patrol for a traffic stop of a suspected drug trafficker coming back from the Pipestone, Minnesota-area.

SFADTF told the SDHP the suspect vehicle would be coming into South Dakota somewhere near Flandreau. They advised the troopers they were looking for a Chrysler 300 being driven by James Lanpher, according to the release.

The troopers were advised that Lanpher would most likely run from officers and was going to be armed, according to the report. When the suspect vehicle did not stop after troopers initiated a traffic stop, a pursuit started as the vehicle traveled through Moody County.

Speeds during this portion of the pursuit reached approximately 60 to 90 mph, according to the report.

During the pursuit, Lanpher shot multiple rounds at troopers, according to the release. At one point when he finally stopped driving he pointed a black rifle at troopers and fired four shots.

One trooper returned fire and fired 11 rounds through their windshield at Lanpher. Another trooper fired four rounds from their handgun while standing outside of their patrol vehicle, according to the release.

Lanpher dropped the rifle in the roadway and fled from the scene. Lanpher fled to the west and was apprehended near a local business on the west side of Madison. Lanpher was arrested and taken to the Lake County Detention Center, according to the release.

SEATTLE (September 21, 2022) – Bloodworks Northwest has opened a new blood donation center in Renton in place of its previous one in Tukwila. The new center is located in Time Square Business Park at 660 SW 39th Street #100, directly across the street from Bloodworks’ testing and processing lab and two blocks from IKEA. This convenient location will provide better efficiencies between the two facilities and allow for faster processing times. The goal of the new, vibrant, modern donation center is to attract younger donors and serve the region.

The Bloodworks Renton Donor Center will operate seven days a week and increase the number of available donor beds by 10%. As a result, Bloodworks expects to collect more than 18,000 donations at the new center in the next year. The organization provides 95% of the blood supply to hospitals in Western Washington and Oregon, including nearby Valley Medical Center. It takes approximately a thousand people each day to provide a safe and reliable blood supply for those in need of transfusions for cancer, trauma, and surgeries in the Pacific Northwest.

“We are thrilled to bring a bigger and better donation center to our community,” said Bloodworks Northwest President and CEO Curt Bailey. “Blood donation is vital to the health and well-being of our community. Our new donor center in one of Washington’s ten largest cities will make it easier for people to donate blood, encouraging them to step up and save lives.”

Bloodworks is also trying to make the experience more donor friendly, with an outlet for cell phone charging behind every bench. There will also be free parking, and the center is near shopping outlets and freeways.

“We wanted something close to our center in Tukwila, which closed in August after 52 amazing years, but also looked at the possibility of adding some efficiencies by being located right across from our lab space,” said Executive Vice President of Blood Services Vicki Finson. “Traffic delays in getting blood processed can be a concern. A unit of blood donated at the new Renton Donor Center will now be in our laboratory within minutes and starting its journey toward helping a patient in need. We look forward to our loyal Tukwila center donors following us 1.2 miles to our new location in Renton and welcoming many new donors as we grow.”

The new donor center will also facilitate employee training of blood collection specialists since it is directly connected to the Bloodworks Northwest Training Suite. It’s also just steps away from the mobile hub, from which staff and mobile collection vehicles are drawn for blood drives within an approximately 50-mile radius.

On September 29 from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., Bloodworks Northwest will have a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the opening of the new donation center. President and CEO Curt Bailey, Executive Vice President of Blood Services Vicki Finson, Renton Mayor Armondo Pavone, Renton City Councilmember Ed Prince, and CEO Valley Medical Center Jeannine Grinnell will be on-site to celebrate the occasion, as will local blood recipient Mack Bell, who owes his life to transfusions from donors in his fight with a deadly condition called aplastic anemia.

https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/01/white-house-whitewashes-dems-school-closure-debacle-blaming-trump/,White House Whitewashes Dems’ School Closure Debacle By Blaming Trump,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre blamed former President Donald Trump and Republicans for the debacle caused by school closures at Thursday’s briefing.

A reporter cited a report by the National Center for Educational Progress that concluded 9-year-olds’ reading and writing comprehension skills had a significant decline since the pandemic, the largest since 1900. She asked if the administration takes any accountability for not pushing to reopen schools at an earlier date.

The press secretary said former President Donald Trump’s administration “mismanaged” the pandemic, which she said led to school closures. She then touted that nearly all schools reopened after only 46% had been open six months before.

“That was the work of this president and that was the work of Democrats, in spite of Republicans not voting for the American Rescue Plan which $130 billion went to school, to have the ventilation, to be able to have the tutoring and the teachers and being able to hire more teachers and that was because of the work that this administration did.”

She criticized congressional Republicans who voted against the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to pour money into reopening schools, businesses and additional relief.

“Our priority remains to make sure states and schools and districts are using these funds, that $130 billion. This is going to go, again, to tutoring, to more teachers, real solutions. Real solutions to make sure that our kids are getting what they need. And, you know, every Republican congress voted against that money. That is the reality. We had to do this on our own,” Jean-Pierre said.

“And so, you know, we’re going to make sure that those funds are directed to the most resources towards students who fell the furthest behind, which is important and we must repair the damage that was done by the last administration, the mismanagement that was done by the last administration, but again, this is something that we took very seriously which is why we passed the American Rescue Plan, which is why we put in $130 billion to deal with what we were seeing in schools.”

The Trump administration, however, advocated to reopen in the Fall of 2020 after schools had shut down in the spring. The former president tweeted, “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” in a July 6 post. He called on Democrats to pass the Republican-backed coronavirus relief bill that intended to fund $105 billion toward reopening schools in the fall, CNBC reported.

The former president warned that school closures would cause “more death” and argued that the risk of fatality among children is low, and therefore school should be open, CNBC reported. He even threatened to slash funds to schools and allocate them to families if they did not reopen. (RELATED: Dem Ad Comes Back To Bite The White House In The A** As They Try To Blame Trump For School Closures)

Trump clashed with teachers’ unions who largely opposed reopening schools during the height of the pandemic. These unions donated several thousands and up to over $1 million to Democratic fundraisers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found in January 2021, that transmission is lower in school than in the surrounding community.

Karla Hernandez-Mats, the Democratic running mate of Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ opponent, is the president of United Teachers of Dade (UTD). She strongly advocated against reopening schools and criticized both Trump and DeSantis for their efforts.

The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) President Randi Weingarten strongly condemned the plan to reopen schools. The AFT and National Education Association (NEA) both supported a lawsuit opposing Florida’s plan to reopen in-person learning.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer bowed to pressure by teachers’ unions to keep schools closed. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged questions on whether the administration would stand up to the teachers’ unions.

“I think it’s unfair how you posed that question, but President Biden wants schools to be open, teachers want schools to be open, families want schools to be open, but we want to do it safely,” she said in February 2021. “But the president is clear. He wants schools to open and stay open. He doesn’t want them open for a month. That’s disruptive for students, for teachers, for families, so he wants the proper steps to be taken so they can reopen and stay open.”",Q3
https://pakobserver.net/govt-lifts-ban-on-import-of-luxury-goods/,Govt lifts ban on import of luxury goods,"Imported phones, vehicles, home appliances to become expensive

Ijaz Kakakhel Islamabad

The federal government on Thursday announced lifting ban on import of non-essential and luxury items, three months after the restriction was imposed.

Addressing a press conference, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail announced that the federal government was lifting the ban, noting that the restrictions were imposed in line with the International Monetary Fund’s demands. The finance minister said that the government’s top priority was to provide basic necessities to the population as the country had a limited amount of dollars.

Miftah said that after much back-and-forth, the IMF has finally announced that its board meeting will take place on August 29, for considering Pakistan’s request for the release of the $1.17 billion tranche. The finance minister noted that the government has also fulfilled all the pre-requisites of the lender, while the funding gap of $4 billion has also been met after friendly countries agreed to help Pakistan financially. Miftah said that after the import ban, it became easier for the government to import necessary commodities, which were essential for the masses.

“We had to choose between importing cars and wheat. Therefore the government had imposed a ban on the import of non-essential items,” the minister added. He further said that the government was scrapping the import ban as it was a requirement of the international community. However, Miftah said, the government would be imposing heavy regulatory duties on these items, adding that as a result these items would not be imported as finished goods. The minister pointed out that the heavy duties will be imposed on completely built-up commodities — cars, mobile phones, and electronic appliances — and apart from them, the imported fish, meat, purse, and other such non-luxury items. “Even then, if a person wants to import a car that is originally worth Rs60 million [but after the regulatory duties] it will cost them Rs300-400 million, they can import it.”

Miftah said the government’s purpose was not just to allow imports of such items but to comply with the IMF conditions and other international agreements while also keeping the current account deficit in check.

The government had aimed to collect Rs42 billion through retail taxes but it would not be able to meet that target, Ismail conceded. “Our revised target is Rs27bn and we will be able to achieve this.” He said the government would pass an ordinance to remove the fixed tax on small traders. However, the variable taxes — 5pc sales tax and 7.5pc income tax — would remain on every trader for the next three months, he said.

After the three months, the variable taxes would remain the same for traders using between one to 50 units of electricity while they would be increased for those whose units were above 50, he added.

“To meet the gap, we are imposing a further tax of Rs36bn on the tobacco industry. The current tax of Rs1,850 per 1,000 cigarettes on tier 2 packs will be increased to Rs2,050 and Rs5,900 per 1,000 cigarettes on tier-1 packs will be raised to Rs6,500. The Rs10 per kg cess tax on tobacco is being increased to Rs380 per kg.”

The minister said the Federal Board of Revenue used to impose taxes on subsidized electricity as well in the past, which had now been removed while sales tax on it would be removed through the upcoming ordinance.

“For example, we used to provide electricity to a small consumer for Rs9 per unit while Ogra (Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority) would fix the price at Rs22. So, the FBR would demand sales tax at the price of Rs22 per unit, but we said the tax will not be imposed on the subsidized amount,” he explained, adding that the government would introduce similar measures for gas.

He said that he would address the sales tax imposed on agricultural machinery as well. “It is a very minor thing and will have little fiscal impact.” He said the country’s exports this year so far were 7-8pc more compared to last year while imports were 18-19pc lower and the trade deficit was around 30pc lower. The money received in the banking system was $600 million higher than last year, he added.",Q3

Pizarro was sitting in a red Honda Civic, saving a parking spot, when another man opened the driver’s door and shot him, officials said.

Arriving officers found Pizarro unconscious and unresponsive. The crewman was hit in the head and neck, NYPD said.

He was rushed to Woodhull Medical Center by EMS where he was pronounced dead, police said.

NYPD said there has been no arrest in the shooting as of Wednesday, July 20.

Pizarro, who was working as part of set security and parking enforcement for the production, was raising six children in Ridgewood, Queens, according to Variety.

After the shooting, production on the popular show was canceled for the day.

Several people who said they were part of Pizarro’s inner circle told Variety they were shocked over the shooting and speculating about a motive. As of the late afternoon, a makeshift memorial had sprouted with candles and flowers sitting near Pizzaro's still-running vehicle.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement to Variety following the murder: “The safety of all New Yorkers is our top priority. No shooting is acceptable, which is why we are working every day to get illegal guns off New York City streets,” the statement said. “The NYPD is actively investigating the fatal shooting of a crew member of ‘Law and Order: Organized Crime’ early this morning.

""We offer our deepest condolences to the victim’s family, friends, and coworkers during this difficult time, and will work diligently to bring the suspect to justice and stem the tide of gun violence we are seeing.”

https://www.ammoland.com/2022/09/taking-california-and-new-york-on-is-essential/,Taking California And New York On Is Essential,"New York/California – -(AmmoLand.com)- While Second Amendment supporters have scored huge victories in federal courts and are advancing in many states, there are two states they need to deal with: California and New York.

In some ways, this was to be expected after NYSRPA v. Bruen. New York and California’s defiance will, in the next few years, make Clarence Thomas’s day with their actions. However, having the legal right is one thing. Being able to exercise that right can be very different.

California and New York aren’t just defying the Supreme Court, they are looking for any way they can harass firearms manufacturers, pro-Second Amendment organizations, and even average Americans who wish to exercise their Second Amendment rights. These states can overwhelm just about any major firearms manufacturer – to say nothing of a local FFL who is the victim of someone using a fake ID or straw purchaser.

California, in particular, has been aggressive about attacking states who pass laws that the regime in that state through travel bans. It may be time for some pro-Second Amendment states to impose similar measures in response, especially if California continues to defy the Supreme Court.

New York is a much different threat. In this case, Letitia James has presided over multiple attacks on the Second Amendment community: She’s sued companies that sold kits or even 80% receivers, she’s targeted the NRA, and her office leaked tax data on Nikki Haley’s advocacy group.

Maybe Nikki Haley isn’t the top candidate for loyal Ammoland readers, but she did not have a bad record on Second Amendment issues, either. Unlike Liz Cheney, she hasn’t turned her back on us. Therefore, we need to have her back in this fight, regardless of any minor disagreements (and given the way Joe Biden is talking about us, there is a lot of stuff that now has to fall under minor disagreements). It is well past time to demand investigations into Letitia James by Congress.

The fact is, anti-Second Amendment extremists in state AG offices can launch attacks and drown the firearms industry in legal fees. That was the plan behind the suits by big cities (and some states) 25 years ago, before the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005. James is trying to replicate that now, to enact controls that have been and likely will be rejected by state legislatures and Congress.

One thing that is essential is for Second Amendment supporters to urge their state lawmakers to protect the FFLs and manufacturers in their states, and requiring that these states intervene in suits like the one James filed against companies that sell 80% receivers. One nuclear option could involve having states like Texas, Florida, or West Virginia sue New York directly, using the language of Article III that states suits by states against other states are cases where the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction. A similar approach could be used against California.

The fact is, Second Amendment supporters can make major gains by defeating anti-Second Amendment extremists via the ballot box at the federal, state, and local levels. But they also need to ask their elected officials to stand up against what California and New York are doing, or else our legal wins could be a dead letter.

Kabul car bomb leaves 7 dead, 41 hurt

KABUL, Afghanistan -- A car bomb went off Friday as worshippers were leaving a Kabul mosque, killing at least seven people and wounding 41, including several children, a Taliban official said.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing.

A Taliban-appointed Interior Ministry spokesman, Abdul Nafi Takor, said the vehicle with explosives was parked by the roadside near the mosque and detonated as worshippers were coming out after Friday prayers. He added that an investigation was underway, with police at the site.

The Italian Emergency Hospital, one of Kabul's clinics that treated the victims, said it received 14 casualties from the site, with four dead on arrival.

""Targeting mosques and worshippers is an unforgivable crime. The nation should cooperate with the regime in eliminating criminals,"" said Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.

Crew abandons migrant boat as it sinks

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Two Cambodian crew members abandoned their boat with 41 Chinese nationals on board as it sank in the Gulf of Thailand, leaving at least one person dead and 19 missing, authorities said Friday.

The small wooden fishing vessel foundered Thursday morning near Cambodia's Koh Tang island.

Eighteen people were rescued at the time but another 23 were reported missing. Three men were found alive Friday and a woman was found dead, according to provincial government spokesperson Kheang Phearom.

Provincial police chief Gen. Chuon Narin told local media that the group of passengers had set off Sept. 11 from the Chinese port of Guangzhou on a speedboat and had been transferred Sept. 17 to the Cambodian fishing boat in international waters.

The boat had been close to its destination of the Cambodian province of Sihanoukville when its engine stopped and it began to sink, he said.

Another Cambodian boat arrived and rescued the two Cambodian crew, leaving the Chinese passengers to fend for themselves, Chuon Narin said. The two Cambodians were arrested and were being questioned by police.

It was not immediately clear why the Chinese were being brought to Cambodia, but Cambodian National Police deputy chief Gen. Chhay Sinarith said last month that authorities in recent years have uncovered numerous illegal online schemes luring workers to the country.

Pakistanis fight illness after flooding

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan deployed thousands more doctors and medics to battle the outbreak of disease as the death toll from the unprecedented floods that have gripped the country this summer surpassed 1,600 Friday, officials said.

The disaster management agency said 10 more people had died from the floods in the past 24 hours -- four in Sindh, the worst-hit province in the deluge, and six in Baluchistan province -- bringing the overall number of fatalities to 1,606 across Pakistan.

Some of the doctors who refused to work in Sindh province have been fired by the government, according to the provincial health department. Floods have killed 728 people, including 313 children and 134 women in the province since July.

Over the past two months, Pakistan sent nearly 10,000 medical staff to tend to survivors in across Sindh. About 18,000 doctors and nearly 38,000 paramedics are treating survivors in the province, according to the latest data from the health department.

Waterborne and other diseases in the past two months have killed 334 flood victims, authorities said.

Also Friday in Sindh, teams of fumigators fanned out across flood-hit areas, spraying in an effort to keep mosquitoes at bay and prevent further outbreaks of dengue fever and malaria. Over 134,000 cases of diarrhea and 44,000 cases of malaria were reported in the hardest-hit areas of Sindh this past week.

Dengue fever is also on the rise, especially in Karachi, the provincial capital, where health teams were spraying insecticide onto puddles of water in the streets.

Cancel Abe's funeral, protesters insist

TOKYO -- Several hundred protesters demanded the cancellation of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's state funeral as they shouted slogans and waved banners Friday in a Tokyo park.

Abe, who was assassinated in July, was Japan's longest-serving leader and one of its most divisive in the postwar period because of what critics call an autocratic approach and cronyism.

Opposition to the state funeral has also grown because of politicians' close ties to the Unification Church.

Social media posts attributed to the suspect in Abe's assassination show he blamed the church for ruining his life. Police say he targeted Abe over his links to the organization.

The government's plans for his state funeral to be held Tuesday have galvanized public opposition against the governing Liberal Democratic party, which has ruled Japan for nearly the entire postwar period.

Protests and marches opposing the state funeral have been popping up nationwide.

DALLAS — On the first day of testimony, Yaser Said sat stoically as prosecutors painted a picture for the jury of a jealous and angry man who controlled his daughters' lives.

“He controlled what they did, who they talked to, who they could be friends with and who they could date,” said Lauren Black, the prosecutor.

Prosecutors say Said killed Sarah and Amina because he was jealous and didn’t want them dating boys who were Americans.

“You’ll hear in this case that leading up to the murders of Amina Said and Sarah Said, the defendant's behavior got extremely dangerous,"" Black said.

Sarah’s boyfriend, Erik Panameno, testified they kept their relationship secret.

""She didn’t want dad to find out and if he did something bad would happen to me or something bad would happen to her,"" Panameno said.

Prosecutors read a letter Amina wrote to their history teacher just 10 days before the girls were killed, talking about their father.

""He has simply made our lives a nightmare. He’s one man, not God,” Amina wrote.

The email came from her account, pinkangelamina@hotmail.com.

In the email, Amina wrote that she and Sarah felt they could trust her to keep the email confidential so that's why they were writing her of their plans.

""We don’t want police involved until we are totally ready,"" Amina wrote. ""I am so scared right now. It’s crazy. OK, well as you know we’re not allowed to date and my dad is arranging my marriage. My dad said I cannot put it off any more and I have to get married this year.""

Amina wrote that she and her sister did not want to live by their father's culture and did not want to marry men from the Middle East ""especially men we don’t know or love.""

In the email, Amina wrote that their father had begun checking their phone records and had threatened to hurt Sarah ""very badly if she didn’t tell what was going on.""

Amina wrote that they did not plan to tell or bring their mother because they worried she would tell Yaser ""out of fear.""

Four days after Amina sent the email, the girls, their mother and their boyfriends fled to the state on Christmas Day 2007. They initially went to Kansas, but then decided to go to Oklahoma where they rented an apartment.

A day after they disappeared, Yaser Said reported his wife, Patricia Said, and two daughters missing. Lewisville police officer Jason Williams took the report.

""Right before we left, he grabbed my hand, took both of his hands around my hands and said, 'Find my daughters. I need them,'"" Williams said.

Panameno, Sarah's boyfriend, testified Said had threatened Amina.

“Her dad pulled a gun on her and said he was going to kill her,” said Panameno.

In the letter to her teacher, Amina wrote she feared her father would find them.

""I know he will search until he finds us and he will without any drama or any doubt kill us,"" the email said.

Witnesses testified the girls returned back to DFW on New Years’ Eve after their mother convinced them to go back home.

Sarah agreed to return to the family home. But Amina refused, instead seeking shelter at the home of her boyfriend, Edgar Ruiz.

Connie Moggio, the girls’ aunt, testified she spoke with Amina just hours before her death.

“She said her mom was wanting her to go home and she didn’t want to. She said she would rather be dead than go back there,” said Moggio.

The girls' bodies were found on New Year’s Day 2008 in a taxi cab that prosecutors say was driven by their father.

They will play a 911 call Sarah made as she was dying.

""She’s asking for help and she names her killer, her father, Yaser Said,” said Black.

The last person to testify on the first day was Ruiz.

Ruiz testified that the girl's mother was using Sarah to text Amina asking her to come home. Then Patricia showed up at his doorstep.

He said he told Patricia that he feared for Amina's safety and he did not think Amina should leave.

""She kept saying they needed to go. They were running out of time. They need to go back home,"" he said.

Ruiz said Amina did not want to go.

""Patricia just took her by the hand and just took her,"" he said.

He says as he left Amina she told him he failed to protect her.

""She said that I would never see her again. This was the last time I would ever see her,"" he said. ""Then she walked out.""

He said he believed she believed her father would kill her.

""She knew she was going to die,"" he said.

About 30 minutes after Patricia left with Amina, he said he spotted Amina, Sarah and their father in a cab. Patricia was not with them and he thought that was odd.

Sarah was in the back seat. Amina was in the front passenger seat.

""Her look was in fear,"" he said. ""She didn’t look like she wanted to be there.""

Amina and Sarah were later found dead inside that cab. Amina had been shot twice. Sarah had been shot nine times. Their father was nowhere to be found.

Before she died, Sarah made two calls to tell 911, telling the operator that their father had killed them.

Defense attorneys told the jury they would try to prove that Said was targeted by law enforcement because of his Muslim faith and cultural beliefs.

""We’re more worried about the Muslim than the murders,” said Joel Patton, Said's defense attorney.

Said was on the run for more than 12 years after he was charged with his daughters' murders.

The trial will continue Tuesday.",Q3

Officials say 24-year-old Keyshlyne Patterson is the suspect in an attempted murder of a man and the woman July 31st, on the 2100 block of North Darien Street. She was arrested on Monday, more than two weeks after the double shooting.

MORE HEADLINES:

According to officials, a 23-year-old woman, identified as Jhayden Gunter, was shot twice in the head while sitting inside a car on the 2100 block of North Darien Street, July 31st, just before 10 in the morning. She was rushed to Temple University Hospital by police and listed in extremely critical condition.

A 28-year-old man was also shot several times as he stood next the woman’s car. He was also transported to Temple and listed in stable condition. Police said the man is Gunter's boyfriend. He was inside a store where, police say, he got into a verbal argument with a woman and, when he got back to the car, the incident escalated into gunfire.

""The female he argued with pulls out a gun, fires at him multiple times, hitting him in the right arm. As he runs from the car, his girlfriend is sitting in the front seat. Ms. Patterson goes up to the passenger side as the door is opening and fires a shot directly into her forehead,"" Philadelphia Police Captain John Walker stated.

Gunter just graduated from West Chester University last year. She now faces an uncertain future. Her mother, Heather Morris, is demanding justice. ""There are repercussions to everything you do and this person has to be held accountable for the damage she's done, single-handedly, on the morning of a Sunday, to an entire family that loves her.""

While she prays for her daughter's future, Morris worries for Philadelphia. ""I don't know what we're going to do. I'm very scared for the city, at this point. It's a beautiful city, but this type of stuff happening constantly, on an everyday basis, is gonna crush this city.""

Patterson has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, firearm carried without license, possessing instrument of crime, carrying firearms in Philadelphia, simple assault and recklessly endangering another person.",Q3

https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/otero-county-commissioners-vote-to-ban-voluntary-abortions-abortion-clinics/,"Otero County commissioners vote to ban voluntary abortions, abortion clinics","OTERO COUNTY, N.M. — The fallout from the repeal of Roe v. Wade continues to be felt in New Mexico.

Otero County commissioners unanimously passed a resolution Thursday naming their county a “sanctuary for unborn life.” The resolution essentially bans voluntary abortions, abortion clinics, and miscarriage-inducing medication.

During the meeting there was plenty of opposition.

“I believe this is a misguided political stunt and religiously misrepresents the faith,” Otero resident Michael Drinkwater said.

“I am not Christian, I am atheist, I don’t prescribe to any religion. You cannot force me to prescribe to your religions rules,” Shayna Young added.

Out of the more than 20 public comments at today’s county commissioner meeting, a majority were against the resolution.

“I urge you to in the strongest possible terms to vote against its passage, thank you,” Nancy Gregory said as she ended her three minute public comment.

But there were also those who wanted to voice their support.

“I am a pro-life advocate and believe life is precious at all stages,” resident John Block said.

“It is the understanding of the law life begins when the infant is in the mother’s womb by the law that life is protected,” Ben Luna read from his prepared speech in front of the county commissioners.

Many community members voiced their concerns this resolution would limit a woman’s access to life-saving medical procedures if her pregnancy put her life in jeopardy. There is a clause in the resolution that states abortions would be allowed in a hospital, not a clinic, if it will save the mother’s life – or in instances of rape or incest.

“Three years ago, when this came up, it was the first year Griffin and I were on the board. I was against it, I was against it for two reasons – medical issues with the baby or if the mother had issues, two, was rape or incest. This now has this incorporated in it,” District 1 Commissioner Gerald Matherly said.

With those changes added to the resolution, it passed unanimously. Afterwards, Couy Griffin made an announcement.

“I would like to just put one more call out to commission boards across the state of New Mexico to get the same type of resolution passed in their counties,” Griffin said.

While abortion is technically legal in New Mexico – there are few, if any, regulations on the books. The legislature repealed an abortion ban in 2021 but it was never replaced with anything.

After the Roe v. Wade decision came down from the Supreme Court, New Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order further protecting abortion access. But no congressional action has been taken.

Leaving measures, like the one Otero County just passed, in a sort of legal limbo.

After the resolution passed, many are saying this bill wont hold up in court – including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who calls this decision a political stunt.

“This action has no effect whatsoever and I think it is another desperate cry for attention,” Lujan Grisham said.

So it the Otero County “sanctuary for unborn life” legal? KOB 4 sat down with UNM Law Professor Maryam Ahranjani.

“I think it is important to understand that the court did not say that abortion is illegal, it just said the Constitution, five judges agreed the federal Constitution, does not explicitly mention or protect the right to abortion and it is still up to state to determine,” Ahranjani said.

After the Roe v. Wade decision came down from the Supreme Court, Lujan Grisham signed an executive order further protecting abortion access.

“I really think it is going to come down to the details of what exactly the ordinance says and potential legal claims in terms of where those parts of the ordinance may violate existing law,” Ahranjani said.

Ahranjani said in New Mexico abortion is legal. The state does have some protections in place – protections that can’t be overturned by county or city officials

“I do believe, ultimately, it will be unenforceable if this goes to the court, that that the ordinance will not be upheld. But the real shame in these instances is the waste of taxpayer dollars to defend those suits for the county, to have to defend themselves and hire attorneys,” Ahranjani said.

This is also why both supporters and opponents of abortion access want the state legislature to put some sort of law on the books the next time it meets.",Q3
https://www.aol.com/news/queen-elizabeth-iis-funeral-5-161909167.html,Queen Elizabeth II's funeral service: 5 key takeaways and moments,"LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral took place at London’s Westminster Abbey on Monday following 10 official days of national mourning.

Attending were the late monarch’s closest family members as well as some 500 world leaders and foreign dignitaries. In total, 2,000 guests bid farewell to Britain’s longest-reigning monarch.

Hundreds of thousands of mourners flooded the streets and parks of the capital city while millions tuned in online to watch Queen Elizabeth make her final journey back to Windsor Castle, where she is to be buried alongside her late husband, Prince Philip.

Here are some of the key takeaways from Monday’s events.

President Biden's arrival

President Biden, attending with first lady Jill Biden, was the only world leader allowed to arrive at the queen’s funeral in a private vehicle. After flying to the U.K. on Saturday, the Bidens made their way to the funeral in the presidential limousine, the ""Beast,” as part of a motorcade. Other world leaders — including French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern — traveled to the funeral by bus.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Biden was given special permission to travel to the event in his own car. Shortly after the ceremony concluded, he headed back to Washington, D.C.

King Charles's goodbye note

The queen’s coffin was draped with the royal standard — a flag that represents all nations in the U.K.: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Colorful wreaths were also placed on the coffin along with a goodbye note from the queen’s eldest son and heir, King Charles III.

The card read: “In loving and devoted memory, Charles R.” The “R” in Charles’s signature stands for rex, the Latin word for king.

Harry and Meghan relegated in seating arrangements

Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, were seated in the second row of the funeral, while Harry’s father, King Charles III, Queen Consort Camilla, Prince William and Kate Middleton were seated in the front row alongside their children. Also in the first row was the queen’s son Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles earlier this year due to his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex — who stepped back from their royal duties in 2020 and moved to California — sat next to Harry’s cousins, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Harry was barred from wearing his military uniform at the funeral despite having served the greatest amount of time in the army, rising to the rank of captain and serving two tours in Afghanistan.

There was significant meaning behind the jewelry that Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, and Meghan wore to the queen’s funeral. Kate wore a four-string pearl and diamond choker necklace that was owned by the queen. The necklace had previously been worn by her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. The piece dates back to the 1970s, when it was presented to the queen as a gift from Japan. Kate previously wore the choker for the queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017, and again for the prince’s funeral last year. Paired with the choker, Kate wore pearl drop earrings that were a gift to the queen from the ruler of Bahrain for her wedding in 1947.

Meghan also wore a pair of meaningful earrings that featured diamonds and pearls. A gift from the queen, Meghan wore them on her first solo outing with her grandmother-in-law in 2018.

A two-minute silence was observed across the U.K. to mark the end of the queen’s funeral. Crowds watching the funeral on screens in Hyde Park and other royal parks stood in silence to honor the queen. Inside Westminster Abbey, the end of the silence was followed by the singing of “God Save the King.”",Q3

The confession of a Lubbock murder suspect will not be thrown out, according to the Lubbock County District Attorney.

Back in November of 2018, human remains were found in the backyard of a Lubbock home. These remains were identified as belonging to Zoe Campos, who was 18-years-old when she disappeared 5 years prior.

Carlos Rodriquez was charged with murder after he confessed and led officers to the body. It was in the backyard of his former residence.

On Thursday, August 5th, 2022, Rodriquez team tried to get his confession thrown out, saying that the confession was obtained by investigators while his attorney was not present. The defense also said that detectives lied to Rodriguez about his DNA being on Campos' body, leading to his confession.

KAMC News reports that Rodriquez initially waived his right to a lawyer when he led investigators to the body, but he was quoted by the defense as saying ""I don't want to tell my side without legal advice.""

Despite all of this, a judge has decided not to throw out Rodriquez's confession. He remains booked in the Lubbock County Detention Center on the charges of murder, stalking and making a terroristic threat. He was arrested in 2017 for stalking and was sentenced to 4 years in prison for it. The murder charge wasn't added until later.

Although the boundaries of East Bengal were based ostensibly on religion, they did not entirely reflect it. Owing to disagreements between the Hindu and Muslim contingents of the commission tasked with delimiting the province, the frontiers were ultimately determined by the head of the commission, Sir Cyril Radcliffe. Excluded wholly or partly from East Bengal were such Muslim majority districts as Murshidabad and Nadia; included, however, were Khulna, which was nearly half Muslim, and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, where Muslims constituted only a small fraction of the population. Even Sylhet, a predominantly Muslim district of Assam that joined Pakistan through a referendum, lost a part of its territory to India. The partition catalyzed large-scale migration on both sides of the new boundary as hundreds of thousands of people who believed themselves to be members of a threatened minority moved into what they perceived as a place of refuge. Along with Muslim Bengalis arriving in East Bengal from Hindu majority districts, there were many Muslims who came from other parts of India, mostly from Bihar.

Pakistan began as a parliamentary democracy with a constituent assembly that was charged with the dual function of drafting a constitution and serving as the new country’s legislative body; however, overbearing central leadership eventually nullified the system. Failing to earn the support of Jinnah, who had become the first governor-general of Pakistan, Suhrawardy stayed in India to work with Gandhi for communal harmony, and Khwaza Nazimuddin became chief minister of East Bengal. In the central government (based in the western wing of Pakistan) Bengalis held the majority in the legislative branch but had little representation in the executive. Physically and linguistically separated, the two parts of Pakistan had only tenuous links; their overriding common interest was fear of Indian domination. Jinnah and his advisers believed that unification might be achieved through a common language, Urdu, which was used in the army and administration. By 1948, however, Bengalis had begun to resent the nonacceptance of Bengali as an official language, the domination of the bureaucracy by non-Bengalis, and the appropriation of provincial functions and revenue by the central government.

During Jinnah’s tenure as governor-general, he maintained a powerful central government under his authority. When Jinnah died in 1948, Nazimuddin became governor-general, but the real power lay with Liaquat Ali Khan, the prime minister. When Liaquat was assassinated in October 1951, Nazimuddin succeeded him as prime minister and installed Ghulam Mohammad, a Punjabi, as governor-general. Ghulam Mohammad consolidated a coalition of civil and military forces in the central government and secured a virtual transfer of power from the politicians to the coalition, first by dismissing Nazimuddin (who still had a majority in the legislature) in 1953 and then by dismissing the entire constituent assembly shortly after the general elections of 1954. In those elections, almost all the seats had been won by the United Front, a coalition of opposition parties led largely by Fazl ul-Haq and his revamped Peasants and Tenants Party (now called the Peasants and Workers Party) and by Suhrawardy, who had made a comeback with a new party, the Awami League. In 1955 Ghulam Mohammad left office, and Maj. Gen. Iskandar Mirza, who had served both as governor in East Bengal and as a central minister, took office as governor-general. Under Mirza, East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan.

With a newly elected constituent assembly, Pakistan in 1956 at last adopted a constitution in which both the eastern and western wings of the country were equally represented. The new constitution also gave the federal government wide powers. Mirza became president and was obliged to appoint Suhrawardy, heading an Awami League coalition, as prime minister; by late 1957, however, Mirza had orchestrated Suhrawardy’s exit from office. In December of that year Firoz Khan Noon became the prime minister, with support from the Awami League.

In 1958 the government of Pakistan came under military control, and Mirza was exiled. The elite civil servants assumed great importance under the military regime, which adversely affected the country’s eastern wing. In 1947 there had been very few Bengali Muslims in the Indian Civil Service (ICS), whereas the western wing had produced several dozen. Although equal recruitment from the two wings was national policy, by 1960 only about one-third of the members of the Civil Service of Pakistan (successor to the ICS) were Bengalis. Moreover, the military installations were concentrated in West Pakistan, as was the bulk of economic aid and development.

Bengali discontent festered, finding a voice in Mujibur Rahman (popularly known as Sheikh Mujib). Like previous leaders, Mujib belonged to a landed family. He had been one of the founders of the Awami League in 1949 and became its leading figure after Suhrawardy’s death in 1963. A superb organizer and orator who was jailed repeatedly by the military, Mujib acquired an aura of martyrdom. Following a 1965 clash between India and Pakistan, primarily over control of territories in the Kashmir region of the western Himalayas, he announced a historic six-point demand for East Pakistani autonomy. When in December 1970 Yahya Khan, president of Pakistan and commander in chief of the armed forces, ordered elections, Mujib’s essentially separatist Awami League won 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan in the National Assembly. This gave the league an overall majority in a chamber of 313 members. In West Pakistan the Pakistan People’s Party, led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, won 81 of 144 seats; Bhutto consequently saw himself as Mujib’s rival.

Throughout March 1971 Pres. Yahya Khan negotiated at length with Mujib in Dhaka while government troops poured in from West Pakistan. Then, on March 25, the army launched a massive attack; destruction was immense, and many students were among the casualties. Mujib was arrested and flown to West Pakistan. Most of the Awami League leaders fled, set up a government-in-exile in Calcutta (Kolkata), and declared East Pakistan the independent state of Bangladesh. Internal resistance was mobilized by some Bengali units of the regular army. Among the most notable of the resistance leaders was Maj. Zia ur-Rahman, who held out for some days in Chittagong before the town’s recapture by the Pakistani army. He then retreated to the border and began to organize bands of guerrillas. A different resistance was started by student militants, among whom Abdul Kader Siddiqi, with his followers, known as Kader Bahini, acquired a reputation for ferocity.

Some 10 million Bengalis, mainly Hindus, fled over East Pakistan’s frontier into India while the Indian government watched with alarm. The Awami League, which India supported, was a moderate middle-class body like the Congress Party; many guerrillas, however, were leftist and a cause of concern. With some of the major world powers taking sides—the United States and China for a united Pakistan, and the Soviet Union and India for an independent Bangladesh—the Indian army invaded both the western and eastern wings of Pakistan on December 3, 1971. The Pakistani defenses surrendered on December 16, ensuring Bangladesh’s independence. A few days later, Yahya Khan was deposed in Pakistan and replaced by Bhutto; Mujib was released from jail and returned to Dhaka to a hero’s welcome.",Q3

The Supreme Court might ban it for good,"Lawsuits before the Supreme Court over race-conscious admissions policies are the latest chapter in the contentious history of affirmative action.

By the late 1960s, many colleges had begun to consider race as one of many factors in admissions, amid the civil rights movement and urban uprisings.

In the decades after affirmative action was instituted, selective colleges saw dramatic increases in their numbers of Black, Latino, and Native American students, experts say.

Along with the gains, came the backlash, with some white students equating affirmative action with ""reverse discrimination.""

In a few weeks, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge to race-conscious admissions policies at two universities, the latest chapter in the contentious history of affirmative action in higher education.

For decades, affirmative action has been used to improve equity and diversity in workplaces and colleges.

But the two lawsuits from Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action group founded by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum, accuse the University of North Carolina and Harvard of discriminating against Asian American students and giving unfair preference to Black and Hispanic applicants – challenging decades of legal precedent. In the lawsuit against UNC, the group says the school also discriminated against white applicants.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani search teams found the wreckage of a helicopter that went down the previous day in the country’s flood-stricken southwest, the military said Tuesday. An army general and five others on board were killed, it said.

The aircraft had lost contact with the air-traffic control tower in Baluchistan province on Monday evening while flying on a relief mission in a flood-hit area in the southwest.

A military statement identified the deceased officer as regional commander Lt. Gen. Sarfraz Ali. It said that, according to an initial probe, the crash happened due to bad weather.

The helicopter was part of aid efforts in the flood-affected Baluchistan, where rains and flash floods since June have killed nearly 150 people. The military provided no further details.

Pakistan's President Arif Ali, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and other senior politicians offered their condolences to the victims' families.

Pakistan is currently using helicopters and boats to evacuate flood victims from various parts of the country, including Baluchistan and Rajanpur, a district in eastern Punjab province.

Rains and flash floods have killed at least 478 people across the country since June. The deluges have also completely destroyed or damaged nearly 37,000 homes in the flood-hit areas, according to a report released by the National Disaster and Management Authority.

Rescue workers backed by the military have evacuated thousands of marooned people, including women and children. More rains are expected this week in Pakistan, where the monsoon season runs from July through September.",Q3

Without any one of these parts, a “law” is no law at all, and is really nothing more than a weightless demand. For example, if a government suddenly declared that murder was legal, that declaration would have no authority over any citizen. It would not really be a law, because it is not in accord with reason and is detrimental to the common good of the community. It could not alter the reality that murder is intrinsically wrong.

But why talk in hypotheticals? Roe v. Wade was just such a so-called “law:” it made the murder of babies “legal.” It does not meet the requirements of Aquinas’s definition (it is not in accord with reason and does not benefit the common good), and therefore does not have the authority of a law. But conservative Americans have sought to overturn of Roe v. Wade through the legislature for years. Why have we been appealing to the legislature to change something that has no real legal authority? It is because we have bought off on common misuse of the term “law.”

Since the problem I’m referring to is a misunderstanding of a definition, I’m going to pause here to define my terms. The problem is legal positivism, which is a form of nominalism that considers laws as deriving their validity simply from their having been legislated (without any regard for whether they ought to have been legislated).

This stands in stark contrast to the Catholic tradition, which recognizes that human laws are valid only insofar as they conform to the natural and divine laws. Rather than seeing laws as recognitions of the particularities of the natural law, legal positivists see human law as something that can be made or unmade arbitrarily, as if out of thin air. This view is culturally prevalent in the U.S. as is indicated by the fact that both liberals and conservatives, at least implicitly, recognize Roe v. Wade as having had the force of law.

Conservative Americans have been using their pro-life stance as an indicator of their righteousness for far too long. Finding the murder of innocent babies wrong doesn’t actually say much about your character other than that you’re possibly a decent, more-or-less sane human being. It’s become the conservative/Christian right-wing form of virtue signaling, masking the fact that we’re all legal positivists here in America, across both the Left and the Right. For abortion isn’t the central issue of the Roe v. Wade story. It’s a deadly consequence of the true problem at the heart of the baby-murdering debate: the false belief that laws shape reality rather than the other way around. This kind of legal positivism is the reason that Roe v. Wade could have ever been decided in the first place, and its inculcation among even pro-life Americans has left them defenseless against such “legislation.”

Case in point: across the country, conservatives have recently been celebrating the fact that Roe v. Wade was “overturned.” What they’re missing is that because there was no justification for Roe v. Wade’s legality in the first place, there was actually nothing there to be overturned—only the false belief that Roe v. Wade provided any real authorization of abortion.

LAHORE: The Punjab Police conducted a raid on the residence of Special Assistant to Prime Minister Attaullah Tarar in Lahore, it emerged on Saturday morning.

Confirming the raid, the Lahore police said that Attaullah Tarar, however, was not present at his residence.

Reacting to the development, the PML-N leader criticised Punjab Home Minister Hashim Dogar and asked him not to cross the line in defence of the “anti-state narrative”.

“Hashim Dogar Sahib! you have turned out to be a very unserious character,” he added.

""What do you want to prove by sending the police to a house where I lived 15 years ago?""

The police, however, did not share details why the raid was conducted.

The PTI leaders had earlier announced that the Punjab government will launch an inquiry and probe the May 25 ""crackdown"" on Azadi March participants. A committee was also formed by the party to oversee the matter.

‘Law awaiting you’

In a statement, Punjab Home Minister Hashim Dogar asked Attaullah Tarar to present himself before the police, adding that law is awaiting him.

The police went to Tarar’s house to deliver a notice, clarified the home minister.

Tarar should present himself before the Lahore police if he understands the power of law, warned Dogar.",Q3
https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/with-record-suicides-america-is-killing-its-own/,"With record suicides, America is killing its own","America is an aging society, but this is no country for old men.

Last year nearly 50,000 Americans took their own lives, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The figures are preliminary, but that looks like it translates into the highest suicide rate since World War II.

Among Americans 65 or older, suicides increased by 8% in the past year.

They climbed 7% among Americans 45 to 64.

The median age in our country today is 38.9, and it’s only rising.

Will suicides rise with it?

The CDC says men account for 80% of suicides, and white men have particularly high rates.

So do rural Americans — areas with the lowest population densities, those designated “micropolitan” and “non-core,” have the highest suicide levels, 19.2 and 21.7 per 100,000 people respectively.

There are differences by occupation as well: Mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction has the highest rate (54.2 per 100,000 men), followed by construction (45.3).

Veterans kill themselves at a rate 57.3% higher than the average for other Americans.

The raw number of suicides last year exceeds the number of Americans who died in the Korean War and the 46,233 who were killed in action or died of wounds during the Vietnam War — a conflict that lasted nearly a decade.

Suicide is one of our nation’s deadliest enemies.

The epidemic of self-murder has many causes, some of which are unique to each case, but others that are culture-wide.

Christianity always discouraged suicide, both by designating it a mortal sin and by offering hope of a new life to even the most wretched earthly sufferer.

In our culture today, Christian assumptions no longer prevail — the taboo on suicide has weakened, and millions believe there is no life beyond divorce, unemployment, addiction, dishonor, sickness and pain in the here and now.

The new numbers could be the highest suicide rate in the United States since World War II. Shutterstock

The blessings of modern medicine can also be a curse.

The elderly and seriously ill can live longer, but prolonged treatment is costly, and men who’ve lived independent lives don’t want to end up sustained by machines.

The opioid scourge, meanwhile, condemns the despairing in two ways: Prescription pain medication is now heavily restricted, leaving some Americans in agony to feel they have no escape, while others who have abused and become dependent on the drugs see no future beyond them.

The main prey for suicide is not a recognized victim group — rural whites and men with blue-collar or military backgrounds receive little sympathy from the highly educated elite who’ve been taught all their lives that the industrial economy is a fossil and America must become more diverse to be truly good.

When economists laud the global economy’s “creative destruction” and progressives rail against “white privilege,” their implication is that the world would be better off without older working-class whites.

And when those obsolete Americans respond by voting for Donald Trump or other populist candidates, that only confirms the sensitively educated liberal’s judgment — these people are deplorables, human obstacles to a more efficient and enlightened future.

The old American left put a great deal of emphasis on solidarity and mutual aid; it also built the entitlement programs that promised to provide for the material needs of the old and unemployed, though these programs totter as the ratio of dependents to workers rises.

The new left now elevates diversity over solidarity and exalts moral purity — in identity-politics terms — above traditional economic class.

Men account for 80% of suicides, according to the CDC. Shutterstock

The emerging America of the 21st century is not only more “diverse,” however, it’s more alienated, with fewer common bonds of religion or civilizational inheritance and without the public as a whole feeling well-represented by the institutions or government or the media.

Older Americans have lived through a cultural revolution that has turned them into strangers in their own land.

In these conditions, as the connections between young and old dissolve and the Christian background of our culture fades away, the rise of suicide is not surprising.

Simple partisan politics is not to blame, but the move of our culture and economy away from the commitments that used to give meaning to Americans’ lives has left tens of thousands of our countrymen lost and looking for a way out.

America is a worse place for the 50,000 men and women we lost to suicide last year.

The next 50,000 need to hear that before it’s too late.

https://www.newswise.com/coronavirus/six-country-african-study-shows-covid-19-can-be-dangerous-in-pregnancy/?article_id=774714,Six-Country African Study Shows COVID-19 Can Be Dangerous in Pregnancy,"Newswise — A new study involving hospitalized women in six African countries from the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s (UMSOM) Institute of Human Virology (IHV) showed that pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had double the risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and four-times the risk of dying in-hospital than pregnant women who did not have COVID-19.

The researchers stated that their findings suggest that women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should avoid getting COVID-19 and protect themselves as best as they can with available vaccines.

The findings were published on June 8, 2022, in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, along with an accompanying viewpoint.

“If the mother does not do well, then the baby does not do well either. As we do not yet have vaccines for babies less than six months old, pregnant women should get the vaccine to protect their unborn children and newborns,” said Nadia Sam-Agudu, MD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics at UMSOM, Senior Technical Advisor for Pediatric and Adolescent HIV at the UMSOM’s Institute of Human Virology, and International Senior Technical Advisor of Pediatric and Adolescent HIV at the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria.

Dr. Sam-Agudu added that currently available evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines indicated for use in pregnancy are safe, and emerging data show that they provide protection for newborns as well as mothers.

The new study was conducted by the African Forum for Research and Education in Health (AFREhealth) Research Collaboration on COVID-19 and Pregnancy. The study examined data on 1,315 women hospitalized in Ghana, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa, including 510 pregnant women with COVID-19, 403 non-pregnant women with COVID-19, and 402 pregnant women without COVID-19.

Women with other risk factors such as diabetes, HIV, history of tuberculosis, or sickle cell disease were at greater risk for severe COVID-19. About 32% of pregnant women with COVID-19 needed in-hospital oxygen therapy compared to 16% of pregnant women without COVID-19. Some 19% of pregnant women with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU, compared to 6% of pregnant women who did not have COVID-19. Among the women hospitalized with COVID-19, 10% of those who were pregnant died compared to the 5% that were not pregnant.

“I would like to appeal to healthcare providers to consider the data with respect to vaccine safety for pregnant women, and to counsel women to help them consider the vaccine in light of the consequences of COVID-19,” said Dr. Sam-Agudu. “Knowing that we have tools to prevent this disease from progressing, we should be more intentional, educational, and supportive about vaccination in pregnancy, so that pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant can access and receive vaccines.”

Overall, COVID-19 vaccination rates remain much lower in Africa compared to much of the rest of the world. As of today, with the exception of a few, full vaccination rates in African countries do not top 40%. According to the researchers, COVID-19 vaccination rates are likely to be much lower among pregnant women in these settings.

African countries still contend with low and inconsistent COVID-19 vaccine supplies, largely due to persistent inequity in access to global vaccine supply and manufacturing. Experts remain concerned that vaccine demand and acceptance may wane, and vaccine apathy may set in, as inconsistent access and supply persist.

“This study furthers confirms that pregnant women face special risks and potential complications from COVID-19,” said Man Charurat, PhD, MHS, Professor of Medicine at UMSOM and the Division Director of Epidemiology & Prevention at UMSOM’s Institute of Human Virology. “Public health experts and physicians need to make more effort to solve the problem of vaccine inequity in Africa.”

E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean, UMSOM, said, “We need to make every effort to ensure that all countries or regions have available access to resources such as COVID-19 vaccines to prevent any unnecessary suffering. It is imperative that we encourage pregnant women to use the tools we now have developed to prevent their own disability and promote healthy births.”

https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/world/nikolas-cruz-trial-graphic-footage-of-parkland-school-shooting-played-for-jurors/,Footage of Parkland school shooting played for jurors,"Few Americans outside law enforcement and government ever see the most graphic videos or photos from the nation's worst mass shootings — in most states, such evidence is only displayed at trial and most such killers die during or immediately after their attacks. They never make it to court.

That has made the penalty trial of Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz for his 2018 murder of 17 people at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School unusual.

As the worst US mass shooting to reach trial, the surveillance videos taken during his attack and the crime scene and autopsy photos that show its horrific aftermath are being seen by jurors on shielded video screens and, after each day's court session, shown to a small group of journalists. But they are not shown in the gallery, where parents and spouses sit, or to the general public watching on TV.

Some online believe that should change — that to have an informed debate on gun violence, the public should see the carnage mass shooters like Cruz cause, often with high-velocity bullets fired from AR-15 semiautomatic rifles and similar weapons.

Others disagree. They say the public display of such videos and photos would add to the harm the victims' families already endure and might entice some who are mentally disturbed to commit their own mass shootings. They believe such evidence should remain sealed.

Liz Dunning, a vice president at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, doesn't believe releasing such videos and photos would have the political impact some think. Polls show that most Americans already support stronger background checks for gun buyers and bans or restrictions on AR-15s and similar weapons, said Dunning, whose mother was murdered by a gunman.

""Public perception is not the issue,"" Dunning said. ""We should be asking more of the powerful.""

Since most of the worst US mass shooters were killed by themselves or police during or immediately after their attack, it is rare for anyone outside government to see such surveillance videos or police and autopsy photos. The public didn't see such evidence after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, Orlando in 2016, Sandy Hook in 2012, Virginia Tech in 2007 and others.

But Cruz, 23, fled after his shooting and was arrested an hour later. He pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of first-degree murder - his trial is only to determine if he is sentenced to death or life without parole. The videos and photos are part of the prosecution's case.

Since the trial began July 18, everyone in the courtroom and watching on TV has seen and heard heartbreaking testimony from teachers and students who saw others die. They have heard the gunshots and screams as jurors watched cellphone videos.

But when graphic videos and photos are presented, those are not shown. Usually, they only hear medical examiners and police officers give emotionless descriptions of what the jury is seeing.

Then at the end of each day, a group of reporters reviews the photos and videos, but are only allowed to write descriptions. That was a compromise as some parents feared photos of their dead children would be posted online and wanted no media access.

Miami media attorney Thomas Julin said in Florida before the internet, any photos or other evidence presented at trial could be seen and copied by anyone. Newspapers didn't print the most gruesome photos, so no one cared.

But in the mid-1990s as the internet boomed, Danny Rolling faced a death penalty trial for the serial murders of four University of Florida students and a community college student. The victims' families argued that the publication of crime scene photos would cause them emotional harm. The judge ruled that anyone could view the photos, but no one could copy them. Such compromises have since become standard in Florida's high-profile murder trials.

The surveillance video of the Stoneman Douglas shooting is silent. It shows Cruz moving methodically from floor to floor in a three-story classroom building, shooting down hallways and into classrooms. Victims fall. Cruz often stops and shoots them again before moving on.

The crime scene photos show the dead where they fell, sometimes on top of or next to each other, often in contorted shapes. Blood and sometimes brain matter are splattered on floors and walls.

The autopsy photos show the damage Cruz and his bullets did. Some victims have massive head wounds. One student had his elbow blown off, another had her shoulder blown open. Another had most of her forearm ripped away.

Yet, despite their gruesomeness, Columbia University journalism professor Bruce Shapiro says most autopsy and crime scene photos wouldn't have a lasting public impact because they don't have context.

Sgt Richard Van Der Eems describes the scene he encountered at the school after the mass shooting. Photo / AP

The photos and videos that have a strong effect on public opinion tell a story, said Shapiro, who runs the university's think tank on how journalists should cover violence.

The photos of Emmett Till's battered body lying in its coffin after the Black teenager was tortured and killed by Mississippi white supremacists in 1955. Mary Ann Vecchio screaming over Kent State student Jeffrey Miller's body after he was shot by National Guard troops in 1970. Vietnamese child Phan Thi Kim Phuc running naked after being burned by a napalm bomb in 1972. The video of police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck until he's dead in 2020.

""They work not just because they are graphic, but because they are powerful, stirring images,"" Shapiro said.

And even if the graphic photos and videos were released, most major newspapers, wire services and television stations would be hesitant to use them. Their editors weigh whether the public benefit of seeing an image outweighs any prurient interest — and they usually pass.

That would leave most for only the most salacious websites. They would also become fodder for potential mass shooters, who frequently research past killers. Cruz did; testimony showed he spent the seven months before his attack making hundreds of computer searches about committing massacres.

""The images of the carnage will become part of their dark fantasy life,"" Shapiro said.

https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/07/21/candidates-clash-in-debate-over-policing-at-mass-and-cass,Candidates clash in debate over policing at Mass. and Cass,"About seven weeks ahead of Massachusetts’ primary election, candidates presented different approaches to tackle a crisis of mental health, substance use disorders and criminal activity in the area of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, also called Mass. and Cass.

Candidates for the state Senate 2nd Suffolk District, Suffolk County sheriff and Suffolk County district attorney faced off at a debate Wednesday in Roxbury hosted by grassroots political organization Boston’s Communities of Color. Throughout roughly four hours of debates, candidates primarily focused — and clashed — on the roles police, prisons and incarceration should play for those living in the long-embattled neighborhood.

During the district attorney candidates' debate, incumbent Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden proposed the expansion of programs to assist people arrested on non-violent charges, while cracking down on predators.

“There are vulnerable people who are suffering from substance use disorder down there, who are homeless, who have mental health issues, and there are people who are coming into Mass. and Cass to sell and distribute drugs and prey on those vulnerable people,” Hayden said. “There is a difference, and they need to be treated differently.”

Earlier this year, Hayden’s office allocated $400,000 in funds seized from drug-related convictions toward Services Over Sentences , a program designed to provide an alternative to prosecution for those convicted of “low-level offenses” at Mass. and Cass. The district attorney's office will distinguish what constitutes a “low-level offense” on a case by case basis, Hayden said.

District attorney candidate and current Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo argued that incarceration has historically been a roadblock to recovery, citing a 2016 study from the Massachusetts Department of Health that found that people who receive involuntary treatment are 2.2 times more likely to die of opioid-related overdoses than people who voluntarily seek treatment.

“When you try to rehabilitate folks with the threat of jail or a conviction, it is incredibly ineffective,” Arroyo said. “They say it's voluntary, but then there are no beds for rehabilitation or mental health, and you end up on a waiting list at the jail, which creates a backlog in our prisons, and you create a situation where they are on probation.”

Arroyo, who has called for reallocation of funds for police into community-based services and public health resources, said funds spent on police overtime and patrols at Mass. and Cass over the past five years alone “is money that could have gone to rehabilitation centers or treatment beds and that would have had a better impact,” Arroyo said. “This is a system that has had rapid overtime fraud repeatedly over the course of the last few decades.”

Hayden did not agree with the idea of removing funding from the police department, offering instead that additional funding be provided to improve issues within the police department and create programs like community policing, integrity reviews or community outreach. “I think that's perfectly OK,” Hayden said. “But just to defund them I don't think is an answer or a solution. I don't think that's ever, ever helped.”

Activist and former Sheriff's Department aide Sandy Zamor Calixte and Suffolk County Sheriff Steve Tompkins at a debate about Mass. and Cass in Roxbury, Wednesday, July 20, 2022 Tori Bedford GBH News

The candidates for Suffolk County sheriff clashed over a proposal to convert the empty Suffolk County House of Correction, a former ICE detention facility, into temporary housing for people experiencing homelessness in the area. Initially pitched last year , the plan would utilize Section 35, a state law that allows someone to be civilly committed and treated involuntarily for an alcohol or substance use disorder.

“For anyone to say that we were trying to criminalize the situation, not only is that wrong, it's negligent,” said Sheriff Steve Tompkins. “What do we do? Do we just let people die on the street?”

Tompkins, a nine-year incumbent, faces a primary challenge from activist and former Sheriff’s Department employee Sandy Zamor Calixte, who argued that the office should focus on building relationships with mental health and housing agencies. The former detention facility could be transformed, she said, without “going back in the direction of locking people up” and leaning on a system of incarceration.

“What’s negligent is the fact that there's a building that could be used … and the only proposal is another lockup,” Calixte said. “We need to get rid of the mentality of locking people up, first and foremost.”

Because people with mental health issues are overrepresented in jails and prisons and incarceration can exacerbate depression and other mental health conditions , Calixte said state officials have a responsibility to provide cognitive behavioral therapy and a pathway to housing for those who are incarcerated.

“If we want to make sure people are successful when they come back to the community, that means leveraging our relationships with agencies and creating a continuum of care,” Calixte said. “We have to tackle education, we have to tackle mental health issues, and we have to tackle homelessness.”

Once people leave a carceral facility, “we are not mandated to do anything with them because we don't have jurisdiction over them,” Tompkins said. “That said, this is not your grandfather's correctional facility anymore. We have to do everything that we possibly can to strengthen people while they're with us, and we're doing that … but once they've left us, they're out of our care.”

Tompkins was asked about four people who died last summer while seeking medical treatment at facilities overseen by his office. “The four people that passed away last summer, frankly, should not have been there, and it's just a confluence of incidences that they died on our watch,” Tompkins said. “They died within 48 hours of coming to us, so they hadn't even been there that long.”

In December, the Suffolk County Sheriff’s office reported its fifth death in six months .

“It wasn't like we did anything untoward to help them along that path of expiring, they would have left. They would have passed wherever they were,” Tompkins said, speaking directly to an audience member who interrupted his answer to accuse him of lying about the circumstances surrounding the deaths.

In the final debate between state Senate candidates for the 2nd Suffolk District, state Rep. Liz Miranda pushed for increased funding for mental health and rehabilitation programs, calling out local activists who highlighted “a looming crisis” some eight years ago, “but sadly nobody listened,” Miranda said.

Former state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson emphasized decentralization of resources in an effort to improve the nearby neighborhoods for residents and businesses.

“Go to Nubian Square, you'll see the fallout. Go to the South End, you'll see the fallout. Go to the businesses over there and you'll see the fallout,” Wilkerson said. “People can say it's not a Boston problem, but Boston has been owning that problem and we never should have. Those other communities have to bear the burden. It's got to be more than the state stepping in.”

Attorney Miniard Culpepper agreed, adding that surrounding states should be involved in addressing the concentration of homelessness and substance use at Mass. and Cass.

“They come from New Hampshire, they come from Rhode Island,” Culpepper said. “We need to have a solution where everyone that is coming to Mass. and Cass to get high, everyone from those different communities need to participate in the solution.”

State Rep. Nika Elugardo pushed back on Culpepper, pushing for increases in housing stock across the city and citing her own personal experience as the child of two parents who struggled with substance use disorder and homelessness throughout the majority of her life.

“People don't come to Mass. and Cass to get high,” Elugardo said. “They come to Mass. and Cass because there's been a breakdown that is tied to people's race, tied to where they grew up, tied to their poverty. People come to Mass. and Cass for the same reason that there are public health breakdowns across the state, and that is that we don't focus our resources on the people who are doing the work.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/16/opinion/ireland-abortion-roe.html,Irish Eyes Aren’t Smiling - The New York Times,"GALWAY, Ireland — I came to Ireland four years ago to cover the searing story of the Scarlet Letter in the Emerald Isle.

Back then, Ireland had a harsh abortion law, shaped by the views of the Catholic Church. The Eighth Amendment to the Irish Constitution, added in 1983, gave fetuses rights equal to the mother’s, ensuring abortion would be illegal, even in cases of rape or incest. Anyone getting the procedure or buying abortion pills online faced up to 14 years in prison. Women were forced to sneak out of the country and go to London if they wanted abortions. Some women went to loan sharks to get the money to travel.

In 2018, a referendum on repealing the Eighth Amendment roiled Ireland with turbulent arguments on a subject that had been subterranean for eons. Edna O’Brien captured the tortured drama in her novel “Down by the River,” based on the sensational 1992 case of a 14-year-old who was raped by a friend’s father and became suicidal when she was barred from leaving the country to get an abortion. She later miscarried.

There was also the heart-wrenching 2012 story of Savita Halappanavar, who rushed to a Galway hospital in distress the day after her baby shower. She was told that her 17-week-old fetus was going to die. As she went into septic shock, she begged the medical team to remove the fetus and save her life. One midwife coldly reminded her that she was in “a Catholic country.” She died after her stillborn infant. The horror of that case galvanized the Emerald Isle.",Q3

The second amended complaint filed Thursday afternoon is the latest legal wrinkle in Disney's two lawsuits stemming from its protracted battle with DeSantis that began last year, when the company publicly denounced the controversial classroom bill dubbed ""Don't Say Gay"" by critics.

DeSantis has leaned into culture-war battles as governor and on the campaign trail, as he seeks the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. He has tarred Disney with the politically loaded term ""woke"" and accused the company of ""sexualizing children"" — a claim Disney CEO Bob Iger called ""preposterous and inaccurate.""

After Disney came out against the bill, which limits classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, DeSantis and his allies targeted the special tax district that had allowed Disney to effectively self-govern its Orlando-area theme parks for decades.

The governor signed measures changing the district's name — from Reedy Creek Improvement District to Central Florida Tourism Oversight District — and replacing its five-member board of supervisors with his own picks.

Before the new board took charge, Disney crafted development contracts that it said were intended to secure its future investments in Florida. In April, the DeSantis board voted to nullify those contracts, prompting Disney to file its federal lawsuit.

The board countersued in state court in Orange County days later.

Following Disney's latest amendment to its federal complaint, the board said it was ""pleased that Disney backtracked on these legal claims against the district in their federal case.""

""Disney's latest legal move puts them in line with the position of what the district has been advocating for months now: that these matters should be decided in state court. We hope this helps expedite justice for the people of Florida,"" said Alexei Woltornist, a spokesman for the district, in a statement to CNBC.

In the state-level case, Disney has filed counterclaims — including a breach of contract claim — and is seeking damages against the board. Earlier Thursday, the board asked that court to dismiss Disney's counterclaims.",Q3
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-20/la-me-rural-california-prison-closure,"A rural California prison was set to close this summer. It’s still open, and inmates want a say","The California Correctional Center in Susanville, a rural town whose residents depend on jobs at the minimum-security state prison to sustain their economy.

When it rains, water pours through the ceilings of the California Correctional Center in Susanville, sometimes flooding the cells of incarcerated men who have resorted to using soap to seal leaks.

Some toilets in the prison don’t flush and are filled with green algae.

And when the Dixie fire — the second-largest wildfire in California history — burned last summer a few miles outside town, inmates were not moved from the facility, even as electricity and water were shut off, smoke filled their cells, and they had to cover their faces with wet towels to breathe, according to court documents filed in Lassen County Superior Court, signed by about 100 men incarcerated there.

“These kinds of barbaric, inhumane conditions are unacceptable in a civilized society,” the documents say.

Inmates and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation agree on one thing: The remote, aging prison, which needs millions of dollars in repairs, must be shut down.

The state was supposed to close the facility by June. But it remains open.

The town of Susanville — where local officials say they face economic devastation if they lose more than 1,000 prison jobs — sued the state last year, and a Lassen County judge issued a temporary restraining order that halted the closure.

As the outside world debates the future of the prison, the men incarcerated there say their voices must be heard.

This summer, prisoners tried to file an amicus brief in support of the closure, detailing problems in the facility.

Judge Robert Moody declined to consider it.

An amicus brief filed last year by Service Employees International Union Local 1000, which represents prison employees, argues that if the facility were to close, workers “risk losing their livelihoods and will be forced to upend their lives and families, decimating their community in the process.”

The lawsuit — with a mostly white town arguing that its survival depends on the incarceration of mostly Black and Latino men — has “this kind of gross, unseemly character,” said Shakeer Rahman, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represented inmates who signed the amicus brief.

“The court is deciding whether a form of bondage, a form of cruelty, is going to continue based on the personal financial benefits of the people around the prison,” Rahman said. “At every single turn, the judge and the city have silenced the voices of our clients in order to keep marching on in this decision making that treats them as a source of revenue.”

The inmates are not challenging their convictions, Rahman noted; they simply want to report dangerous conditions that justify the prison’s closure.

The case in rural Lassen County could foreshadow conflicts to come as California’s inmate population declines and other prisons are considered for closure.

California George Floyd protests reached deep into rural California. The reactions were mixed, sometimes scary Antiracism protests following the death of George Floyd are happening even in rural, mostly-white communities. Along with them have come threats and rumors.

The Deuel Vocational Institution in the San Joaquin Valley city of Tracy closed last September. In this year’s budget, the administration of Gov. Gavin Newsom said it was “committed to right-sizing California’s prison system to reflect the needs of the state” and could close three more prisons, in addition to the California Correctional Center, by 2025.

In its lawsuit, Susanville argued that when the state announced the prison’s closure in April 2021, it violated the California Environmental Quality Act because it had not conducted the proper reviews of the shutdown’s impact on the town. After the temporary restraining order was issued, the state began the environmental impact review process in January.

But tucked into this year’s budget — which Newsom signed June 30 — was a trailer bill that says California law exempts the closure of state prisons and juvenile facilities from review under the state’s environmental law.

The bill says the California Correctional Center must close by June 30, 2023. For now, the temporary restraining order remains in effect, said Vicky Waters, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

Susanville City Administrator Dan Newton said the state has not been transparent about why that facility was chosen over older, more rapidly deteriorating prisons and those in cities with more employment opportunities.

With their trailer bill, state lawmakers appear to have “changed the law to suit their process,” Newton said.

Few places rely on a prison as much as Susanville, the only incorporated city in Lassen County. The nearest city, 86 miles away, is Reno, Nev.

More than 45% of employment in Susanville is at the California Correctional Center and the adjacent High Desert State Prison, local officials told The Times.

Susanville’s population — about 16,000 last year, according to the census — has long included thousands of inmates at both facilities, a boost that makes the town seem bigger and more attractive to incoming businesses.

Attorneys for the inmates — many of whom are sent to Susanville from urban counties several hours away — said it is dehumanizing for city officials to consider them residents when that is beneficial but to disregard their concerns about basic living conditions.

In court papers, Duane Palm, who is serving life without the possibility of parole for two counts of first-degree murder and other charges, wrote that the prison’s remote location makes it hard for loved ones to visit.

“Isolation from the world,” he wrote, is the best description for the prison. “There’s a fear of dying in the event of a medical emergency due to having to travel from Susanville to Nevada for urgent care.”

Inmates wrote that conditions during the Dixie fire, which prompted evacuation orders in surrounding areas, were particularly harrowing.

Waters, the corrections department spokeswoman, said in an email that officials closely monitored the fire, and it “did not come close” to Susanville’s prisons.

“While fires in the area last year damaged power lines supplying electricity to High Desert and CCC — as well as the community there in general — both institutions used their respective generators in order to supply power and ensure appropriate prison operations,” Waters wrote.

Inmates, she added, were offered N-95 masks “to lessen the impact of unhealthy air days.”

Timothy Peoples — who is serving a life sentence for first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder and other charges — described with sarcasm what he said was an uncaring attitude by prison employees.

“Hey! The Dixie Fire is over and the ash from the fire was harmless and don’t worry about the smoke your lung’s are probably fine so there’s no need for medical to check,” Peoples, 52, wrote in court papers.

Patrick Everett Noel — who is halfway through a 37-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder, assault and other charges — wrote that inmates had to sit in dark cells during the fire because the electricity was off, and they were not allowed access to the outdoor yard for weeks.

Even as “we could see the flames of the fire from our windows over on the top of the mountain,” inmates were not informed of a fire safety plan, Noel, 38, wrote.

The delay in closing the facility has drawn criticism from those who say it is the morally and fiscally responsible thing to do.

“It is inarguable that the incarceration crisis disproportionately affects Black people and other marginalized groups,” said Brian Kaneda, deputy director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a coalition of groups dedicated to reducing incarceration in the state.

“CCC is a crumbling, 58-year-old prison,” he said. “Obstructing this process should be of concern to people because it’s wasting millions of dollars that would be better spent elsewhere, including to support jobs and economic development in Susanville.”

Bringing other industries to Susanville would be ideal, but that won’t be easy, said Mayor Pro Tem Thomas Herrera.

Local leaders, he said, are trying to ramp up tourism, focusing on the Bizz Johnson National Recreation Trail — an area for hiking, biking and horseback riding along a scenic, old railroad line — and reviving Main Street, as well as trying to bring in music festivals and other events.

But the loss of the prison would be “a very big punch to our community,” and transitioning will take time, Herrera said.

The reality is that even those who do not want to leave the already struggling town will have to do so if they lose their jobs.

“If you pull that big of a facility out of our community, that’s not just something you can recover from overnight,” Herrera said. “There is a desire to get better industry here. But it’s tough.”

https://pakobserver.net/evacuations-ordered-in-northern-california-after-new-wildfire-breaks-out/,Evacuations ordered in northern California after new wildfire breaks out,"Evacuations have been ordered around Klamath national forest in northern California after a major new wildfire broke out amid searing heat, a pro-longed drought and lightning across the region.

The fire, known as the McKinney fire, has grown to 18,000 acres in less than 12 hours and has zero containment. It has forced officials in Siskiyou county to order the evacuation of nearby communi-ties, a virtual repeat of the Washburn and Oak fires that have recently ignited in California’s western Sierra Nevada.

“The McKinney fire has grown significantly as winds from late evening thunderstorms kept the fire active through the night,” National Park Service officials tweeted.

“Runs on the north and south sides of the fire occurred. Firefighters were forced to shift from an offensive perimeter control effort to evacuations, point protection and structure defense.”

The park service said it had issued a red flag warning for the region. “Fire managers are expecting a very dynamic day on the fire as predicted weather is expected to be problematic for the firefighters,” park officials posted. It warned that “lightning and high fire danger will likely result in new fire starts”.

Nick Nauslar, a fire meteorologist with the Na-tional Interagency Fire Center, confirmed that the conditions would probably start new blazes. “We think that we’ll see ignitions and potentially a number of significant fires as well.”

Officials observed that after an initial bout of thunderstorms on Friday, the McKinney fire had grown explosively overnight, forming a towering pyrocumulonimbus cloud, or a fire-generated thunderstorm.

The region has been under a heat dome, or a ridge of high pressure in the upper atmosphere, for several days. That is now forecast to weaken as a trough approaches, bring with it the likelihood of further lightning strikes. But the Klamath national forest has no recent fire history, meaning that there is a large amount of combustible material on the forest floor.

“It’s a classic one-two critical fire weather punch with a preceding extended and intense heat wave followed by the breakdown of the ridge,” Brent Wachter, a fire meteorologist with the Northern California Geographic Coordination Center in Red-ding, California, told the Washington Post.—Reuters",Q3
https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/california/story/2022-07-22/newsom-signs-gun-bill-modeled-after-texas-abortion-ban-setting-up,"Newsom signs gun law modeled after Texas abortion ban, setting up Supreme Court fight","SACRAMENTO — California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a controversial gun control bill modeled after Texas’ vigilante abortion law on Friday, teeing up a legal battle with a U.S. Supreme Court friendly to 2nd Amendment groups and firearm owners.

Newsom started a game of legal chess in December when he called for gun control legislation in California modeled after a Texas law that authorizes private citizens to sue anyone who aids and abets in an abortion, which the high court declined to block.

State Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) and a coalition of Democratic lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 1327 in response to Newsom’s request as a way to test the Supreme Court’s legal logic while setting up a political rivalry with states that have used a conservative majority of justices to expand gun ownership and curb abortion rights.

“If they are going to use this framework to put women’s lives at risk, we are going to use it to save people’s lives here in the state of California. That’s the spirit, the principle, behind this law,” Newsom said during a news conference to sign the bill.

Newsom on Friday morning also announced that he was running a full-page ad in Texas newspapers targeting Gov. Greg Abbott “for refusing to protect human life and take action against gun violence.”

“If Texas can ban abortion and endanger lives, California can ban deadly weapons of war and save lives,” Newsom wrote in a tweet.

Earlier this month, Newsom ran another campaign ad in Florida, which claimed that freedom is “under attack” in the Sunshine State and urged residents to “join us in California.”

Abbott Press Secretary Renae Eze said Newsom should instead “focus on all the jobs and businesses that are leaving California and coming to Texas.”

The new gun law, set to go into effect in January, will allow private people to sue anyone who imports, distributes, manufactures or sells illegal firearms in California, such as assault weapons, .50 BMG rifles and so-called ghost guns. The law requires a court to order $10,000 in damages for each weapon used in an alleged violation, along with attorneys fees. The bill was written so that if Texas’ law is nulled, California’s would similarly be invalidated.

Newsom placed SB 1327 at the top of a list of more than a dozen bills he prioritized this year to help address a national crisis of mass shootings and to further limit the gun industry’s already restricted influence in California. Newsom signed another measure this month to establish a “firearm industry standard of conduct” and to allow local governments, the state Department of Justice and gun violence survivors to sue for violations of state law. Other bills he signed limit firearm advertising to minors, crack down on ghost guns and require school officials to investigate credible threats of mass casualty incidents on campus.

Proponents billed SB 1327 as a way to curtail gun violence by enlisting the legal help of private residents in stopping the spread of prohibited firearms in the Golden State.

The Texas statute that inspired California’s law allows citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone who helps a person to obtain an abortion after five or six weeks of pregnancy.

“You’ve gotta do everything possible to reduce gun violence,” Hertzberg said. “If Texas is going to use this legal framework to essentially outlaw abortion for women, California is going to use this legislation to save lives.”

Lawsuits against many, if not all, of the bills are expected, with several gun ownership groups citing the policies as an infringement on 2nd Amendment rights.

“It is obvious that this is a retaliation against lawful gun owners and the court because of the Texas decision,” said Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California. “There’s a full expectation that the firearms industry will have a very strong reaction towards the signing of this bill.”

“They are really, really trying to be nothing but vindictive against lawful people in the firearms industry,” Paredes added. “All of our attorneys are in the process of evaluating what we are going to do on this thing.”

When the Supreme Court upheld the Texas law, some 2nd Amendment advocates voiced fears it could be used against them by gun control advocates, with Erik Jaffe, a lawyer for the Firearms Policy Coalition, calling the decision a vehicle for “deterring the exercise of any and all rights.”

But other legal experts question whether California’s strategy to mimic the Texas abortion ban will render the same outcome if it is brought before the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.

“One big difference between this law and Texas’ [abortion ban] is the likely opinion of the Supreme Court,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor with expertise in 2nd Amendment issues.

Winkler pointed to the Supreme Court’s recent decisions that struck down abortion rights guaranteed in Roe vs. Wade and a New York law that restricted concealed carry as evidence against its likelihood in upholding California’s new private right to action.

“The Supreme Court is much more likely to strike down California’s law than the Texas law. We now know one of the reasons the Texas law was not struck down is the court, within a matter of months, would overturn Roe vs. Wade,” Winkler said. “The same court is expanding 2nd Amendment rights and is now likely to take a ban on assault weapons as unconstitutional.”

The American Civil Liberties Union also raised serious concerns with the new law’s enforcement tactics.

Shilpi Agarwal, legal director at the ACLU of Northern California, said the group doesn’t object to what the bill aims to accomplish in limiting access to illegal firearms. Instead, Agarwal said the ACLU disagrees with circumventing the courts by allowing a private right to action as a way to enforce those restrictions, which could essentially establish a “constitutional arms race” with other states.

“The federal Constitution creates the floor on our rights that states can’t go below. That is what ensures that all citizens, no matter what state they live in, enjoy a baseline level of rights, which courts then enforce,” Agarwal said. Texas’ abortion ban “is meant to create a trap door in that floor. And now other states are creating their own trap doors. California is creating one as well. And with all of these trap doors, the floor becomes meaningless.”

A legislative analysis of the bill cautioned that replicating a Texas-style private enforcement strategy “may be flawed and dangerous” and noted that California already “tightly controls, regulates, and criminalizes activities related to restricted firearms.”

Hertzberg said the strategy is still worth trying.

“We don’t like the framework, but if we can take advantage of it and save lives, why is that wrong?” he said.

Newsom said that California has to assert itself after the Supreme Court “opened the door.”

“It was a terrible decision, but these are the rules that they have established.”

Honolulu police announced on Friday night that the man arrested for the death of his estranged wife has been charged with second-degree murder.

Bryant Tejada Castillo, 29, is accused of stabbing Dana Alotaibi, 27, on the H-3 Freeway on Wednesday night. Police said Castillo also stabbed himself before officers caught him hiding in the nearby brush.

Alotaibi died at the hospital. Castillo was also taken to the hospital for his injuries.

Castillo's bail is set at $1 million.

ORIGINAL STORY ON 7/21:

HONOLULU (KITV4) -- The woman who was murdered on the H-3 Freeway on Wednesday night has been identified by her mother as Dana Alotaibi. She was 27 years old.

""It's so sad, it's very sad, because we have our plans for everything,"" said the victim's mother Natalia Cespedes.

Cespedes is still trying to process the fact that she'll never get to see her daughter again.

""Feeling so bad this, I have a feeling like working in the empty space, I don't know. It's so so hard to explain,"" Cespedes said.

Alotaibi was married to a marine stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay. Alotaibi documented some of their tumultuous relationship on social media. Cespedes says the couple was married for almost three years.

Court records show Alotaibi's husband filed for a divorce last November. The uncontested divorce was granted last month.

Cespedes says her daughter was three months pregnant.

""Just want to know my daughter has plans to come back to Virginia, make her life, live with her kid because she was pregnant, so we get everything ready for the she come back,"" Cespedes said in broken English,

Instead, Cespedes is making plans to bring her daughter's body back to Virginia.

""Was feeling so sad. Look, my life is empty. I really want to, I really has planned for here for my grandbaby, and I think how they're dead has been very trouble,"" Cespedes said.

Alotaibi leaves behind her parents and three sisters.

""Only I can pray is bring, I want to bring my daughter home what was the plan,"" Cespedes said.

Tannia Cardenas was one of Alotaibi friends. She said they spoke with each other every day, and she's still in shock.

""It's real, like I'm never going to see my friend again, and I'm glad my last talk with her was positive,"" Cardenas said.

The tragedy unfolded in the public eye, on the side of the H-3 Freeway westbound just before the Kamehameha Highway off-ramp near Kailua, at 6:18 p.m. on Thursday.

""Witnesses observed a male standing over a female stabbing her multiple times,"" said Lt. Deena Thoemmes, Honolulu Police Department.

One of those witnesses was a man driving to work. He did not want his name identified. He said initially he thought it was just a fight when he pulled over to help.

""Whenever I got there, I pretty much froze out of fear and shock,"" he said.

But after that moment of fear, he and others stepped in -- some calling 911, and others doing what they could to help.

""Witnesses tried to restrain the male and render aid to the victim,"" Thoemmes said.

The witness said he was trained in CPR, but quickly realized the victim was fading fast.

""You know obviously when we're doing CPR there's no pulse, they didn't get a pulse the whole time, and it was just her face, she just looked past the point of no return, you know,"" he said.

""Could you imagine being stabbed in the neck and then watching as your life just literally leaks out of you, and everyone around you either doesn't know what to do, or is too shocked to do anything about it, I couldn't imagine that.""

Police said the suspect fled into the nearby brush with the knife in hand. Officers searched the area and found the suspect. Police say the suspect also cut himself.

The victim, Alotaibi, was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The suspect was also taken the hospital in serious condition.

Marine Corps Base Hawaii sent KITV4 the following statement:

""The Marine Corps is aware of a tragic incident that occurred yesterday evening (July 20, 2022) allegedly involving a US Marine currently assigned to the 3rd Littoral Combat Team. Our understanding is that the Marine is currently in the custody of the Honolulu Police Department as their investigation continues, but has not been formally charged. The 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment and Marine Corps Base Hawaii will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials as the details surrounding this incident unfold. The Marine Corps extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of those involved.""",Q3

Suzi Brady, a Cal Fire spokeswoman, said several people were injured and taken to a hospital. She said she didn't know the extent of their injuries.

Brady said residents are still evacuating and that the blaze continues to rapidly spread amid 36 mph winds.

She said more resources have been requested to aid at least 200 firefighters battling the blaze on the ground and from the air.

Brady didn't know how many people have been injured or where they were taken.

The Mill Fire started on the property of Roseburg Forest Products, a lumber mill north of the town of Weed, and quickly burned through homes and prompted evacuation orders for all of Weed and the nearby communities of Lake Shastina and Edgewood, with a combined population of about 7,500 people, said Weed councilwoman Sue Tavalero.

She said there were burned homes in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood but ""I don't know how many. I'm positive several homes have been lost.""

The blaze spread quickly in hot and windy conditions, the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The Mill Fire had burned 1.4 square miles, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Rebecca Taylor, communications director for Roseburg Forest Products based in Springfield, Oregon, said she did not know where or how the fire started, but the company evacuated its veneer plant in Weed after the fire was reported at 12:58 p.m. Friday. Some of its property is burned. The plant employs 145 people, although not all were on shift at the time, Taylor said.

""We're just devastated to see this fire affecting the community in this way,"" she said.

Evacuees described heavy smoke and chunks of ash raining down from massive flames near Weed, about 50 miles south of the Oregon border.

Christopher Rock, an employee at the Mayten Store in Montague, 30 miles north of Weed, said fire evacuees had swarmed the pumps.

""It's really busy right now,"" he said. ""You can't see the flames from here, just a lot of smoke.""

Marco Noriega, brew master at Mount Shasta Brewing Company, said he received the notice to evacuate around 1 p.m. and he sent the 10 customers and three employees away. He said the power is out and he has received little information.

The wind was blowing from the south, keeping the fire away. He sounded calm as he cleaned up.

""I've been through it before, so long as the wind stays in the direction it is, I'm all right. But I know the wind switches quickly,"" he said by phone.

The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for Siskiyou County from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday when area winds were expected to reach up to 31 mph.

Willo Balfrey, 82, an artist from Lake Shastina, said she was painting Friday afternoon when her grandson, who is a member of the California Highway Patrol, called to warn her of the fast-spreading flames.

""He said, 'don't linger, grab your computer, grab what you need and get out of the house now. It's coming your way.' So I did,"" Balfrey told The Associated Press.

She grabbed a suitcase full of important documents, as well as water and her computer, iPhone and chargers, and headed out the door.

""I've reached the philosophy that if I have all my paperwork, what's in the house is not that important,"" she said.

She stopped to get her neighbor and they drove to a church parking lot in Montague, where about 40 other vehicles were also parked.

Olga Hood heard about the fire on her scanner and stepped onto to the front porch of her Weed home to see smoke blowing over the next hill.

With the notorious gusts that tear through the town at the base of Mount Shasta, she didn't wait for an evacuation order. She packed up her documents, medication and little else, said her granddaughter, Cynthia Jones.

""With the wind in Weed everything like that moves quickly. It's bad,"" Jones said by phone from her home in Medford, Oregon. ""It's not uncommon to have 50 to 60 mph gusts on a normal day. I got blown into a creek as a kid.""

Hood's home of nearly three decades was spared from a blaze last year and from the devastating Boles Fire that tore through town eight years ago, destroying more than 160 buildings, mostly homes.

Hood wept as she discussed the fire from a relative's house in the hamlet of Granada, Jones said. She wasn't able to gather photos that had been important to her late husband.

In Southern California, firefighters were making progress Friday against two big wildfires despite dangerously hot weather.

Containment of the Route Fire along Interstate 5 north of Los Angeles increased to 37% and it remained at just over 8 square miles in size, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection statement said.

Firefighters were focusing on mopping up hotspots and building more containment lines, trying to get most of the hard work done before the midday heat, Cal Fire said.

California is in the grip of a prolonged heat wave. Temperatures have been so high that residents have been asked for three consecutive days to conserve power during late afternoon and evening hours when solar energy declines.

On Wednesday, seven firefighters working the Route Fire in triple-digit temperatures had to be taken to hospitals for treatment of heat illnesses. All were released.

""Excessive heat, low humidity and steep terrain will continue to pose the biggest challenge for firefighters,"" Cal Fire said.

The tally of destroyed structures remained at two, and all evacuation orders were lifted.

In eastern San Diego County, the Border 32 Fire remained at just under 7 square miles and containment increased to 20%.

More than 1,500 people had to evacuate the area near the U.S.-Mexico border when the fire erupted Wednesday. All evacuations were lifted by Friday afternoon.

It wasn’t pretty.

U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, the top-ranking Republican on the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, sent the transportation secretary a five-page letter Friday. In the letter, Graves accused Buttigieg and the Biden administration of “pursuing its own woke priorities” and a “radical agenda” while ignoring the restrictions Congress has placed on transportation programs

“In his first year, President Biden issued more executive orders and approved more major rules than any recent president. We are concerned that such reliance on the administrative state undermines our system of government. Our founders provided Congress with legislative authority to ensure lawmaking is done by elected officials, not unaccountable bureaucrats,” Graves wrote.

The top Republican on each of the subcommittees for the transportation panel also signed the letter.

Buttigieg and Democrats on the transportation committee did not respond to requests for comment.

Graves repeatedly cited a 6-3 decision the U.S. Supreme Court handed down in late June. The majority in that case, West Virginia v. EPA, ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency could not regulate carbon dioxide pollution generated by power plants, despite language from the Clean Air Act that suggested it could.

The conservative majority said that such “major questions” should be decided by Congress, not regulatory agencies.

“Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible solution to the crisis of the day,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme in [the section of the Clean Air Act that regulates power plants].”

“A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body,” he continued.

(On the other hand, the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the Clean Air Act required the EP to regulate carbon dioxide pollution, in a case dealing with vehicle emissions.)

In the letter to Buttigieg, Graves said the West Virginia case “stands as another reminder that Congress is the entity ultimately responsible for writing the law in the United States.”

“We are concerned over the promulgation of recent DOT rules and guidance materials that, we believe, seek to implement policies that were either rejected by Congress or are demonstrative of perverse agency decision-making,” Graves and the other Republican lawmakers wrote.

“This is compounded by Biden Administration-led efforts to impose partisan policies government-wide. Furthermore, it appears as though DOT and the administration are implementing these policies that violate the spirit of law,” they added.

Graves gave several examples of what he saw as overreach by Biden’s Transportation Department, including:

A December memo from Stephanie Pollack, the deputy administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, that laid out the agency’s approach to the use of money that Congress approved in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

A FHWA proposal from July that would require states and metropolitan planning organizations to measure and make plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Graves said the proposal “seems similar” to the power plant regulations the high court struck down in June. Graves also asserted that “Congress considered and ultimately rejected a [greenhouse gas] performance measure requirement during the development of IIJA,” a point difficult to confirm, because almost all of the negotiations over details of the infrastructure package occurred in private.

The Transportation Department including “merit” criteria on top of requirements in the law for judging grant applications for major infrastructure projects. The criteria at issue would measure a project’s ability to further safety, maintain a state of good repair, help the local economy, mitigate environmental impacts, further equity and promote innovation. “By scoring projects against this merit criteria, DOT is effectively changing the purpose of the discretionary grant programs, once again, in contradiction of IIJA,” Graves wrote.

The Biden administration’s rollout of its Justice40 Initiative, which seeks to direct 40% of the overall benefits of grant funds in certain programs to disadvantaged communities. Graves noted that the administration would determine which areas qualify as “disadvantaged.” “This is unacceptable. The Biden administration cannot simply rule by decree; it must follow congressional intent. Imposing Justice40 across DOT programs in such a cross-cutting fashion is alarming, and we are concerned that DOT’s implementation of this initiative will undermine the intent of the laws enabling the affected programs,” Graves wrote.

The Republican lawmakers asked Buttigieg to provide extensive documentation about the role the White House had in forming the transportation department’s policies, pending and expected rules the department planned to issue, and details of how Justice40 would be implemented.

Graves’ letter comes not only a few weeks before the November midterm elections, but also a few days before Democrats, who currently control the House transportation committee, plan to hold a hearing on the importance of infrastructure laws passed since Biden took office.",Q3

He is the second African American to lead the command, which has about 6,000-7,000 troops across the continent.

Speaking at the ceremony, the outgoing commander, Army Gen. Stephen Townsend, noted the often limited troops and resources allocated to the continent.

Mark Winters speaks Tuesday night in front of an overflow crowd in the Naperville City Council chamber.

Emotions ran high on both sides of the gun control debate Tuesday night in Naperville as community members and city officials weighed in on a proposed ban on the commercial sale of some high-powered weapons.

At Tuesday's city council meeting, community and council members debated an ordinance prohibiting the sale of what Naperville officials describe as “assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, defined as ammunition magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition.”

In a draft of the ordinance, city staff members listed five pages of specific firearms that couldn't be sold in the city, including the AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle used in the Highland Park parade shooting that killed seven people and injured dozens.

An “assault weapon” is defined in the ordinance to include a semi-automatic rifle with a magazine that is not fixed and has certain features like a pistol grip or a grenade launcher.

The ordinance could face a final vote on Aug. 16 at the next city council meeting.

“I don't care if someone sues and gets this law overturned, though I hope that doesn't happen,” said the Rev. Mark Winters. “You all get to tell this community and the rest of the country, ‘We are not going to willingly participate in helping mass shooters arm themselves.'”

The ordinance would affect two gun stores in the city in addition to other local licensed sellers such as pawnshops. Private sales of the weapons would not be prohibited, and residents would not be blocked from owning them.

“If you pass that ordinance, you will literally destroy — in the blink of an eye — everything that my family has spent a large part of their lives building together,” said Robert Bevis, owner of Law Weapons and Supply in Naperville. “This ordinance, if passed, would do absolutely zero to prevent even one crime or fatality. It will not stop one criminal intent on coming into the city of Naperville to commit a crime.”

The council chambers were filled Tuesday night with an overflow crowd of people supporting and opposing the proposed ban. More than 50 people signed up to speak on the issue and dozens more submitted written opinions.

After a parade of public speakers that lasted hours, including breaks called by Mayor Steve Chirico because of disruptions in the crowd, the city council members gave their opinions on the first reading of the ordinance.

In a memo to city council members, City Attorney Michael DiSanto said Naperville's home-rule powers allow officials to regulate the sale of “assault weapons and large-capacity magazines within their jurisdiction.”

National Rifle Association State Director Jon Weber disagreed with DiSanto's assessment of state law.

“Illinois generally prohibits local municipalities from passing their own brand of firearm regulations,” Weber said. “That means any ban passed by the Naperville City Council would be in violation of state law.”

After Tuesday's debate, the city council voted to make changes to the ordinance, directing staff and the city attorney to add an exemption for police, law enforcement and military personnel. The changes also remove handgun sales and the sale of large capacity magazines for handguns from the proposed ban.",Q3
https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2022/09/come-say-high-forbidden-cannabis-joins-the-central-district-as-seattle-marijuana-industry-equity-efforts-continue/,‘Come Say High’ — Forbidden Cannabis joins the Central District as Seattle marijuana industry equity efforts continue,"A family of Washington pot shops now spans from the banks of the Columbia to the Central District. Forbidden Cannabis Club opens Friday on E Union.

Meanwhile, Seattle has a new set of policies hoped to improve equity in the city’s cannabis industry.

CHS reported in July on the deal to purchase Central District pot shop Ponder and its E Union property coveted both for the value of its land and its cannabis license just down the street from the headquarters of one of the city’s leading pot retailers, Uncle Ike’s.

With the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board approving the transfer, the transaction is now a done deal and Forbidden has announced its September 23rd grand opening with promotions and sale prices.

The acquisition adds a new Forbidden Cannabis store to a family of retail shops that includes locations in Carson, Lacey, Okanogan, Olympia, and now E Union.

Ownership of Forbidden includes industry veteran Saranjit Bassi who took on the city of Bonney Lake over its retail cannabis ban. According to corporate filings, the E Union location will be managed under Forbidden business partners Amandeep Ghag and Paul Sandhu.

The group will now be entering into a neighborhood pot retail battle with Uncle Ike’s on its owner Ian Eisenberg’s home turf.

The opening comes as Seattle has put new legislation into place in response to the Social Equity in Cannabis Task Force formed to address the lack of diverse ownership and issues with working conditions for frontline employees at the city’s cannabis businesses.

The package of legislation signed last week by Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell includes a bill that prepares the city for issuing new “social equity licenses” for Seattle’s marijuana industry. The license could be a core element that would provide a new path to ownership for qualifying entrepreneurs and is hoped to even the playing field for those seeking the coveted permits.

The origins of Washington and Seattle’s path to legal retail marijuana business ownership included no efforts to address diversity in the industry or the historical inequity of drug law enforcement. Most of the original owners in the city were white entrepreneurs rewarded for being early movers as the industry took shape.

Ponder owner John Branch is one example, opening Ponder quietly in the Central District in 2015 as the neighborhood’s second pot shop. A year earlier, Eisenberg had opened his first Uncle Ike’s location at 23rd and Union, and, for a time, the store sold more pot than any other in Seattle. Ponder continued on as a quiet alternative to the flashier, more ambitious Ike’s.

Terms of the deal with Forbidden were not disclosed and details of the planned property sale have not yet been made public in county records.

The Oak Fire in central California broke out on Friday and spread rapidly, destroying 41 buildings and forcing thousands to evacuate.

By Tuesday, nearly 3,000 firefighters and 24 helicopters at the scene had achieved some success containing the blaze, aided by slightly higher humidity levels, which are forecasted to increase further in the coming days.

Jonathan Pierce, a California fire department spokesman, told AFP that efforts to curtail the spread of the blaze could soon be aided as it approaches areas already ravaged by wildfires from recent years.

""If this fire hits the Ferguson fire scar, it will slow down a little bit because there is less fuel there,"" he said.

""That fire was as recent as 2018, so all the vegetation that has come back will be more thin than a lot of the vegetation that has not been burnt.""

So far, the Oak Fire has burnt 18,000 acres -- the largest by area this year, but relatively minor compared to the mega-blazes that have engulfed hundreds of thousands of acres in recent years.

Its spread has been driven by an abundance of combustible fuel following years of drought and hot, dry weather conditions.

California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday declared a ""state of emergency"" in Mariposa County, citing ""conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property.""

The Oak Fire is burning just a few miles from the smaller Washburn Fire, which briefly threatened Yosemite's rare giant sequoia trees earlier this month.

In recent years, California and other parts of the western United States have been ravaged by huge and fast-moving wildfires, driven by a warming climate.

The fire comes as the usually cooler Pacific Northwest is in the grip of extreme temperatures, forecast to top 100 degrees F (38C) in parts of Oregon.

https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/women-combat-why-rush-judgment,Women in Combat: Why Rush to Judgment?,"Introduction

Should America send women into combat? This question is again before Congress as part of the intense debate over a defense budget bill. At stake is a policy change that could affect millions of women and men, have major cultural implications and alter America's military readiness.

On June 18, the Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Manpower and Personnel will hold hearings on ""the utilization of women in the military."" Last month, without debate, an amendment by Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat, was added to the 1991 Defense Budget Authorization Bill in the House of Representatives. The amendment would repeal the ban on women in aircraft engaged in combat missions. If the bill that includes this provision becomes law, it would change military policy profoundly and have possibly wide-reaching effects. Among them:

It would lead to the subjection of women to any renewal of a mandatory military draft. In 1981, the Supreme Court ruled women ineligible for the military draft on the grounds that the draft is for the purpose of raising combat personnel. ( Rostker v. Goldberg, U.S. Supreme Court, June 25, 1981. The Court stated: ""The fact that Congress and the Executive have decided that women should not serve in combat fully justified Congress in not authorizing their registration, since the purpose of registration is to develop a pool of potential combat troops."" Cited in Ellen C. Collier, ""Women in the Armed Forces,"" Foreign Affairs and National Defense Division, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, May 6, 1991.) Removal of the combat exclusion would eliminate the reason for excluding women from the draft. It would almost certainly lead to assignment of women to all combat jobs, not just those aboard aircraft. It would give credibility to those groups that seek gender-blind government policies. For better or worse, the armed services are often on the cutting edge of social policy.

Since 1948, when Congress passed the Combat Exclusion Act, women have been barred from combat positions in the Air Force, Marines and Navy. The Army, although not covered by the act, maintains its own regulatory ban on women in combat roles.

Whatever the merits of the proposal to put women into combat positions, the issue is too important to be resolved without a full, open public debate. Recent statements and actions indicate, moreover, that military officials have not always addressed the issue with candor. In fact, cross-examination at the Virginia Military Institute trial in April in Roanoke, Virginia, revealed vast discrepancies between official pronouncements from United States military officials and actual conditions regarding the integration of women at the United States Military Academy at West Point.

Data Needed. With the Gulf war over, there is no compelling reason to rush to a decision on whether American women should be sent into combat. A General Accounting Office study of women's roles in Operation Desert Storm is not due until January. Congress should wait at least until then before addressing the issue.

Then Congress, too, must evaluate such vital information as how women affected and were affected by operations during the Gulf war and elsewhere. To obtain data for this, Congress should authorize an independent study of women's roles in the military, including projected costs and advantages or disadvantages associated with placing women in combat units. The study should focus on training standards, current attrition rates among officers and enlisted personnel, performance records, the effect of family policies, and projected manpower needs in light of current plans to reduce military forces.

The Schroeder Amendment would leave it up to the military to decide whether to include women in combat roles. (In a May 7 letter responding to inquiries from Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, Christopher Jehn, Undersecretary of Defense for Manpower, writes: ""If current combat exclusion laws were repealed, the Department of Defense would be obligated to allow women to enter any career area for which they qualify. Conversely, in time of need the Department could utilize women in any career area for which they qualified."" This would seem fair on the surface, but standards have been lowered or eliminated to accommodate women at the nation's service academies and in the armed services generally, so the concept of ""qualified"" may have to become elastic to meet social pressures rather than the needs of military preparedness. ) But it would be more appropriate and more in the American tradition for civilian authorities to make a decision that will have wide-ranging social implications. Says Defense Secretary Richard V. Cheney: ""I believe the Congress is the appropriate forum for a full and open discussion of the larger political and social issues associated with such a proposed change. The views of the American people should also be heard on this extremely emotional issue."" ( Testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, May 21, 1991.)

The Legislation

Last month, the House passed the 1991 Defense Budget Authorization Bill, which limits defense spending to $290.7 billion. George Bush has said he will veto the bill because of cuts in the ""Brilliant Pebbles"" portion of the Strategic Defense Initiative, elimination of B-2 bomber funding and the addition of a provision allowing abortions to be performed at miltary base facilities.

Bush has yet to comment on the Schroeder Amendment, which would repeal Section 8549 of Title 10, U.S. Code, which bars women from Air Force aircraft engaged in combat missions. Part of Section 6015 of the same law, pertaining to Navy and Marine aircraft engaged in combat missions, would also be repealed.

The bill passed the House without any debate or discussion of the Schroeder Amendment, which was added on an unrecorded voice vote in the Armed Services Committee.

Senate Armed Services hearings on the defense bill are scheduled for June 18 with a vote expected sometime in July.

Senator William Roth, the Delaware Republican, introduced a separate measure on May 15 that removes restrictions against women serving as combat pilots. The bill does not require the Defense Department to have women combat pilots, but gives the Secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force the authority to ""prescribe the conditions under which female members... may be assigned to duty in aircraft that are engaged in combat missions."" (S. 1076, introduced May 15, 1991 in the U.S. Senate, cited in Congressional Record, Vol. 137, No. 73.)

In January 1990, Schroeder introduced a proposal directing the Army to conduct a four-year test period of allowing women in Army occupations closed to women, including combat roles. Although the legislation was never voted on by the full House, the Army rejected it in April, saying there was no need for such a test. During hearings on the proposal held by the Military Personnel and Compensation Subcommittee, several military women testified that they welcomed some expanded opportunities but had no interest in combat duty. While these women's views may or may not represent the majority of women in the armed services, they demonstrate that the opinion that women should be in combat roles is not unanimous among servicewomen.

Women in Arms

Since the advent of the all-volunteer forces in 1973, the number of women serving in the military has climbed from 2.5 percent of all personnel in the armed forces to nearly 11 percent. (""Women in the Military: Attrition and Retention,"" United States General Accounting Office, July 1990, p. 2.) There now are 233,000 active duty women in uniform, of whom about 15 percent are officers. ( Carolyn Becraft, ""Women in the Military, 1980-1990,"" a report by The Women's Research and Education Institute, Washington, D.C., June 1990.)

As women have entered the military in greater numbers, more jobs have been opened to them. In 1988, the General Accounting Office estimated that 1.1 million out of 2.2 million military jobs were closed to women under combat exclusions and related program needs. GAO reported that ""most of the women interviewed indicated that the processes related to assignments, promotions, and educational opportunities were fair to women. The women had mixed views on whether the laws and policies related to combat exclusion, a major career impediment, should be changed to permit women to serve in all positions."" (""Career Progression Not a Current Problem, But Concerns Remain,"" General Accounting Office, September 1989, cited in Fact Sheet, Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, April 1991.)

In February 1988, the Defense Department adopted a ""risk rule"" that excludes women from ""non-combat units or missions if the risk of exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture is equal to or greater than the risk in the combat units they support."" ( Collier, op. cit., p. 7.) This rule replaced regulations that were largely based on geographical proximity, and opened up more combat-support jobs to women. The new regulation is supposed to reflect the changing nature of a battlefield that includes the threat of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons.

Top Brass Speak

Within the past two weeks, two senior Army generals have spoken out opposing further expansion of women's military roles. On June 11, General Carl Vuono, the Army's Chief of Staff, told reporters: ""I don't see any immediate change as a result of the Gulf war... I don't see any reasons to recommend a change. I'm talking about some of the physical aspects of ground combat that I'm not sure the bulk of the women soldiers would be able to handle."" (""A Nay for Women in Combat,"" editorial in The Washington Times, June 12, 1991.)

The week before, General J.H. Binford Peay III, commander of the Army's 101st Airborne Divison (Air Assault), speaking at a Fort Campbell, Kentucky, press conference said: ""I don't think we should expand on these things."" Peay explained that the Gulf operation involved a long deployment and a short conflict, and warned: ""Don't draw the wrong conclusions. This was not a five-year war."" (David Shayne, ""Gulf War Doesn't Justify Greater Women's Roles, 101st Leader Says,"" The Tennessean (Nashville), June 5, 1991, p. 1B.)

The Case for Women in Combat

Schroeder's arguments for ending the combat exclusion are echoed by the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS). The committee was established in 1951 to advise the Pentagon on the role of women in the military and is composed of 30 to 40 men and women who serve three-year terms. Members are selected according to ""their outstanding reputations in business, the professions, public service and their records of civic leadership, with due regard to equitable distribution of fields of interest and geographical location,"" according to a DACOWITS Fact Sheet. Committee members long have contended during twice-yearly hearings and in periodic reports that current policies limit the contribution women can make to the military and unfairly limit women's careers. (DACOWITS, Recommendations, Requests for Information, Commendations Made at the 1976 Fall meeting, November 14-18, 1976, p. 1. Calling the combat exclusion laws ""arbitrary and unnecessary,"" DACOWITS officially recommended ""That laws preventing women from serving their country in combat and combat-related or support positions be repealed."" Cited in Brian Mitchell, Weak Link: The Feminization of the American Military (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1989), p. 128.) DACOWITS members have noted at public hearings that millions of women already have served in the military in various capacities, and that the great majority of military jobs are already open to women. At present, 100 percent of Coast Guard jobs are open to women, 97 percent of Air Force jobs, 59 percent in the Navy, 52 percent in the Army and 20 percent in the Marines. (""Women in the Armed Services: The War in the Persian Gulf,"" a report by the Women's Research and Education Institute based on figures supplied by the Department of Defense, March 1991.) In addition, DACOWITS members contend that technological advances have already placed women in harm's way, such as duty aboard certain reconnaisance planes and Naval combat vessels.

America's tradition of equal rights, meanwhile, apart from other factors, would seem to guarantee equal opportunity for all citizens, regardless of gender, in public service-related jobs. Backers of the Schroeder proposal also argue that several women were killed and captured during Operation Desert Storm without an outcry from the public, and that many of the 33,000 women deployed in the Gulf served in positions that came under fire.

The Candor Gap

The case made by advocates of women in combat may be valid -- or it may be wrong. The problem is that the official statements upon which a sound evaluation must be based have been misleading and even, perhaps deliberately, false.

As a result, not enough is known about the effectiveness of current policies regarding the inclusion of women in the armed services and at the nation's military academies. Although Pentagon officials insist that the integration of women into the military has caused few or no problems, several instances raise questions about a possible discrepancy between official policy and actual experiences.

In April, for example, a West Point official, testifying under oath in the United States District Court in Roanoke, Virginia, revealed that the U.S. Military Academy at West Point has adopted unofficial quotas for women on admissions and for specific programs. (Testimony, United States of America vs. Virginia Military Institute et al., U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, Roanoke Division, April 8, 1991, p. 539.) The testimony came during a trial over Virginia Military Institute's men-only admissions policy. Called as a witness was Colonel Patrick Toffler, Director of West Point's Office of Institutional Research. The prosecution had summoned him as a witness expecting to bolster the claim that admission of women at West Point has had no ill effects.

Revealing Testimony

Under oath, and perhaps for the first time publicly anywhere, Toffler said just the opposite. Under cross- examination by VMI's attorney, Toffler acknowledged that separate physical requirements indeed exist for men and women at West Point, and that some physical activities for both sexes have been made easier or eliminated so that women would not suffer what Toffler delicately called ""adverse impact."" ( Ibid., p. 608.)

Toffler's sworn testimony further revealed -- again, probably for the first time -- that according to a West Point survey taken last year, some 50 percent to 68 percent of women cadets reported that they had been sexually harassed; 23 percent reported that someone had come into their room when they were asleep.

Under oath, Toffler also admitted that West Point has identified 120 physical differences between men and women, plus psychological differences. This, testified Toffler, has prompted West Point to make its physical training easier to accommodate women. According to Toffler:

Cadets no longer train in combat boots because women were suffering higher rates of injury; cadets now wear jogging shoes.

Women cadets take ""comparable"" or ""equivalent"" training when they cannot meet standards in some events. In practice this means that West Point males must do pull-ups while females merely do ""flex-arm hangs.""

The famed and valuable ""recondo"" endurance week during which cadets used to march with full backpacks and undergo other strenuous activities has been eliminated, as have upper-body strength events in the obstacle course.

Running with heavy weapons has been eliminated because it is ""unrealistic and therefore unappropriate"" to expect women to do it.

Where men and women are required to perform the same exercises, women's scores are adjusted to give them more weight.

Today's West Point males are not increasing their cardio-vascular efficiency as much as their predecessors did because they are insufficiently challenged by physical training standards geared to include women.

In load-bearing tasks (carrying and lifting), 50 percent of the women score below the bottom 5 percent of the men.

Peer ratings have been eliminated because women were scoring too low.

Fraternization between the sexes is occurring on campus. Said Toffler under oath: ""I think it would be fair to say that certain forms of sexual activity can have a place on the grounds at the Military Academy."" ( Ibid., p. 585-586.)

The cadet honor system has been weakened by making breaches of the code no longer grounds for expulsion in most cases.

In addition to Toffler's sworn, unprecedented look at how women actually have affected West Point, shreds of other data indicate that sending women into combat creates serious problems. Examples:

1) The Defense Department reports that on February 13, some 16,337 single parents, most of whom had custody of their children, were deployed in Operation Desert Storm, along with 1,231 military couples with children. The Pentagon has not yet revealed how many single mothers with small children were deployed, how many were nursing at the time, or how many married women with small children were deployed. In some reports, single men without custody of their children were not distinguished from women with custody of children, thus skewing the public perception. The Pentagon has also not revealed how many women soldiers and sailors became pregnant during the war, although some reports indicate that pregnancy rates exceeded the average number of 10 percent to 15 percent at any given time of all women in the armed services. (Telephone interview with former Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services member Elaine Donnelly of Donnelly Media Associates, June 10, 1991.)

2) During the December 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama, initial reports from Pentagon sources indicated that Captain Linda L. Bray had led a military police squad into fierce combat, capturing a dog kennel and crashing a jeep through a fence. At the time, Bray's actions were publicized by the Pentagon and hailed widely as proof that women are well suited for combat. Later it was revealed, however, that the initial reports had been wrong. Bray in fact had been a half-mile from the scene when the shooting occurred, that there were no casualties after a ten-minute scuffle, and that not she but her subordinate had driven the jeep through the fence. This is not to say that Captain Bray did not act honorably in the situation. It is simply that initial Army reports appear to have exaggerated her role, probably deliberately to enhance the Army's campaign to please the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services and other groups advocating sending women into combat.

3) During the Panama invasion, a female truck driver taking troops into a combat zone started crying. Another woman who had been performing the same job also broke into tears, and the two women were relieved of duty. After reporters learned about the incident, the Army ""took pains to convey that the women had not disobeyed orders or been derelict in their duty,"" reports The New Republic. ""On the contrary, according to an Army official quoted in the Washington Post: ""They performed superbly."" Since men, too, have been relieved of duty after breaking down emotionally during combat, the point is not to single these women out. The point is that the Army was less than candid about the incident. As The New Republic commented: ""To call the overall performance of a soldier who breaks down and cries during combat 'superb' is ludicrous and patronizing."" (""Soldier Boys, Soldier Girls,"" The New Republic, February 19, 1990, cited in Congressional Quarterly Supplement, February 7, 1990, p. A14.)

4) Male officers are warned unofficially that their career advancement will suffer if they dispute the official line that integration of women in the military causes no problems nor affects the armed services' readiness. Writes military journalist Brian Mitchell: ""In recent years, the Defense Department has moved to squelch dissent on the issue and labored to ensure that only the approved view of women in the military is presented to the American people. In so doing, it has fostered cynicism and resentment among military men.... "" ( Brian Mitchell, Weak Link: The Feminization of the American Military (Regnery Gateway: Washington, D.C., 1989), p. 9.)

5) Last October, the Committee on Women's Issues, an advisory panel appointed by U.S. Naval Academy Superintendent Rear Admiral Virgil L. Hill Jr., issued a report criticizing the academy for not moving fast enough to accommodate women, who now make up 10 percent of the academy's enrollment. Committee member Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat, demanded ""an attitude change"" at the academy. The committee report, according to The Washington Post, calls for ""immediate dismissal of senior officers who question the role of women in the military."" ( Lisa Leff, ""Sex Bias Study Takes Naval Academy to Task,"" The Washington Post, October 10, 1990.)

6) A U.S. Naval Academy Report, ""The Assimilation of Women in the Brigade of Midshipmen,"" presented to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Military spring meeting in April calls for combatting the ""widespread misperception that [the] academy's mission is to produce warriors and only warriors,"" (""The Assimilation of Women in the Brigade of Midshipmen,"" United States Naval Academy, April 1991.) and states that officers who ""foster the opinion that women should not be midshipmen should be relieved."" (Ibid.) The report also reports a ""strong likelihood of backlash [from male midshipmen] as policy changes [are] implemented,"" announces a ""zero tolerance"" policy against backlash, and reports that ""there has been no backlash."" (Ibid.)

From these and many other examples, it is clear that the issue of women in combat has not been sufficiently and objectively explored.

Other Nations' Experience

Israel

The only reliable record of women in combat is provided by Israel, a nation whose policy is widely misunderstood. The popular conception is that Israeli women fight alongside men as equals. The truth is that although Israel drafts both women and men for military service, Israel has excluded women from combat units since 1950.

To be sure, female soldiers fought alongside male colleagues in Israel's War of Liberation, which ended in 1948. Because of the problems that this created, Israeli women never again were sent into battle. Explains military historian Edward N. Luttwak of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has written a book about the Israeli military: ""Men moved to protect the women members of the unit instead of carrying out the mission of the unit."" (Telephone interview, June 10, 1991.) Luttwak adds that women are integrated into the Israeli military at many levels, and conduct most of the training. Women also serve in the Mossad, Israel's elite counter-terrorist force. But women are excluded, Luttwak notes, from infantry and other combat positions based on ""the pragmatic experience of 40 years."" (Ibid.)

The Israelis also bar women from combat for cultural reasons. After the War of Liberation, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said that placing women in combat violated the Jewish concept of womanhood and women's status as mothers. (Interview with senior Israeli military official, June 12, 1991, Washington, D.C.) At a Washington briefing this month, a senior Israeli military official said that even tentative experiments with women serving aboard missile-defense boats had failed miserably. Furthermore, he said, because of its cultural heritage, Israel ""is not ready to pay the price of a woman being held hostage, a woman returning crippled."" (Ibid.)

In hearings before the Military Personnel Subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services in November 1979, Brigadier General Andrew J. Gatsis, USA (retired), testified that Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan told him that during Israel's War of Liberation, ""we had a constant fear of what the Arabs would do to our women if they captured them."" The men, Dayan told Gatsis, ""could not stand the psychological stress"" of watching women being killed and captured. Gatsis also said that Dayan ""felt that [having women in combat units] knocked down their combat effectiveness."" (""Women in the Military,"" hearings before the Military Personnel Subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, November 13-16, 1979 and February 11, 1980, pp. 281-282.)

Canada

In Canada, combat training was opened to women in 1987 as part of CREW Trials (Combat Related Employment of Women). The Canadian Defense Ministry had planned to form an infantry unit with 40 men and 40 women and compare them with a unit of 80 men. The experiment was never completed because not enough females volunteered, according to Commander Judith Harper of the Canadian Defense Ministry in Ottawa. (Telephone interview with Heritage Foundation researcher on June 7, 1991.) From 1987 to February 21, 1991, some 342 women were enrolled in Canadian army combat units, and 79 graduated. More than half the graduates were radio operators. Of 102 women who enlisted in infantry training, only one graduated. That woman served her three-year mandatory term and recently left the army. (Ibid.)

Canada's five-year training program for fighter pilots has produced two female pilots, Harper said. No figures are available for training costs, although U.S. Air Force spokesmen report that it costs more than $2 million to train a military pilot to fly an F-111D, and from $1.4 million to $2 million for seven other aircraft. (""Representative Officer Aircrew Training Costs,"" U.S. Air Force document AFR 173-13 Table A34-1, figures in 1989 dollars. Also, telephone interview with United States Air Force Air Training Command Public Affairs Office, Randolph Air Force Base, Randolph, Texas, June 10, 1991.) If women pilots were to drop out of the program because of pregnancies, it would prove very costly to taxpayers.

The other nations without combat exclusion laws or policies -- Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Portugal -- have not tested women in battle and have little probability of doing so.

Conclusion

Putting women into combat roles would be a policy change with major cultural and military implications. If women become eligible for combat, then all women of draft age would be subject to conscription were the military draft renewed. For this reason alone, the American people are entitled to know the facts before any decision is made about allowing women in combat.

An open and thorough debate on this is essential. Congress needs to review all information available, including the General Accounting Office's forthcoming study on women's roles in Operation Desert Storm. In addition, an independent study of the effects of current policies regarding women in the military should be conducted because the military has not always been candid about this topic.

In any independent study, at least several questions need to be answered:

Would combat roles for women be optional or assigned? If optional, would combat assignments for men also be optional?

Is there an objective monitoring process to determine whether allowing women in combat would aid or hinder military effectiveness?

If all laws and regulations against women in combat are repealed, will there be any reason for female soldiers to believe that they will not be subject to combat roles in any theater on an equal basis with men?

Since dual standards for physical regimens are in effect at the service academies, will males and females be subject to dual standards in all the services?

Of those single parents in Operation Desert Shield/Storm who had custody of their children, how many were mothers with young children?

Did child care problems, including reassignment requests, affect morale or slow the deployment of troops?

Did any problems result from quartering male and female troops in proximity with little personal privacy?

How many complaints have been registered concerning sexual harassment, fraternization, assault or rape?

How do enlistment and re-enlistment rates for men and women compare with those before Operation Desert Storm?

How would the Schroeder Amendment affect the National Guard and reserves of the Air Force, Navy, Marines and Army?

Answers to these and other serious questions are essential before the nation decides whether to send women into combat. This is not an urgent matter requiring a quick decision. There is no emergency. On this issue, therefore, America should not rush to judgment.

https://www.vox.com/23273455/kansas-abortion-roe-dobbs-ballot-initiative,Why the Kansas abortion amendment is so confusing,"is a policy correspondent for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.

Editor’s note, August 3, 2022: This story was originally published on July 27, and on August 2, 2022, Kansans voted to reject this amendment. For Vox’s latest coverage of the results, click here.

On Tuesday in Kansas, abortion rights will be tested at the polls for the first time since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

In 2019, Kansas’s Supreme Court ruled that the state’s constitution protects the right to an abortion. Now voters are asked to weigh in on a proposed amendment that would explicitly remove that right, opening the way for Kansas’s Republican-controlled legislature to further restrict or ban abortion, just as neighboring Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri have done.

The other elections taking place Tuesday are the state’s Democratic and Republican primaries, although registered independents — who compose 29 percent of Kansas’s electorate — may also vote on the abortion amendment. The timing is intentional: Republican lawmakers placed the measure on the August primary ballot instead of into the November general election in hopes that turnout remains low. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the state roughly two to one.

Four other states will vote on abortion-related ballot measures later this year, all in November. In Kansas, millions of dollars are pouring in from supporters and opponents of the amendment, and the outcome is being closely watched nationwide as a potential signal of how energized voters are about abortion rights.

The outcome will also have major implications not only for Kansas residents but also for women from across the region who depend on Kansas for reproductive care as their own states shut down abortion access. The Guttmacher Institute predicts Kansas could see a more than 1,000 percent increase in abortions in the post-Roe era as neighboring states outlaw the procedure.

The amendment’s passage would make it easy to ban abortion outright in Kansas

You’d be forgiven if you had trouble making sense of the amendment’s text, which would add a paragraph to the state’s constitution that says both “Kansas does not require government funding of abortion” and that people, through their elected officials, “may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or circumstances of necessity to save the life of the mother.”

The language could trip up the average voter, said Neal Allen, a political scientist at Wichita State University. “You could read it and think you were voting to eliminate state funding of abortion when there is no state funding to abortion,” he told Vox. “And there is language that refers to exceptions to preserve the health of the mother, and for rape and incest, but there’s nothing about the amendment itself that would create those exceptions.”

Supporters of the amendment, organizing under the banner of “Value Them Both” — a reference to valuing “women and unborn children” — have been working to convince voters that a “yes” vote on the amendment would not lead to an abortion ban and would simply allow lawmakers to regulate the procedure.

Many of their claims have been dubious at best, and have generated significant confusion. Value Them Both supporters have stressed in their advertisements that the amendment “restores our ability to place basic regulations on the abortion industry.” In fact, abortion remains highly regulated in Kansas. They say the amendment would merely allow lawmakers to impose rules like requiring parental consent, “stopping painful late-term abortions,” and barring public funding of abortion. But Kansas already requires parental consent, already bans public funding of abortion, and already bans abortion after 22 weeks.

If the amendment passes, nothing could stop Republican lawmakers from passing a total or near-total abortion ban, and political experts say the likelihood of such restrictions moving forward in that context is very high.

Richard Levy, a constitutional law professor at the University of Kansas, told Vox that even though the amendment is not itself a ban on abortion, it’s safe to assume Kansas lawmakers would adopt highly restrictive abortion laws if the amendment passes. He pointed to the supermajority of Republicans in the House and Senate, the Kansas legislature’s long history of adopting laws intended to limit abortion, and to the fact that the amendment’s supporters have indicated that’s their goal.

Earlier this spring, a Kansas Republican lawmaker introduced a bill to ban abortion statewide with no exceptions for rape or incest. It did not receive a hearing or vote, but last month a regional director from the Value Them Both coalition was caught on tape telling a group of Republicans that they stand ready to support the bill if the amendment passes. A Value Them Both spokesperson did not return Vox’s request for comment, but told Kansas Reflector that the regional director “is no longer with the organization and didn’t speak on behalf of the coalition.”

Kansas — a reliably Republican state at the national level — has a long history of conflict over abortion rights. In 1991, a Wichita abortion clinic, at the time among the few in the country that would provide third-trimester abortions for women with life-threatening pregnancies or severe fetal abnormalities, became a magnet for protesters in what was seen as a sign of an emboldened national movement against abortion rights. In 2009, the doctor who performed those abortions, George Tiller, was murdered while attending church.

The Kansas state legislature banned abortion after 22 weeks in 2012 and passed a law in 2013 stating that life began at fertilization. But voters in Kansas have repeatedly expressed opposition to full abortion bans. One poll released last year from Fort Hays State University found 60 percent of Kansas residents opposed making abortion illegal in all circumstances, including in instances of rape, incest, or where a woman’s health is at risk.

A narrow majority of respondents — 50.5 percent — also said their state government “should not place any regulations on the circumstances under which women can get abortions” compared to just a quarter who disagreed.

The first public poll of the Kansas amendment was released July 18, and found only 5 percent of likely primary voters supported a total abortion ban. Near-total bans, such as those passed in neighboring states, were also deeply unpopular with survey respondents.

Russell Arben Fox, a political science professor at the Wichita-based Friends University, also believes Republicans would “absolutely” pursue a ban on abortion if the amendment were to pass.

“The simple truth is that anyone with even a minimal understanding of Kansas politics must realize that pursuing a total ban is exactly the kind of policy that the Republican leadership will pursue,” he told Vox. “Besides the obvious influence which fervent anti-abortion conservatives have long had within the Republican Party in Kansas, and besides the fact that one of the leaders of the pro-Value Them Both movement was caught on tape ... there is also the fact that we know that game plans detailing the introduction and passage of complete state abortion bans, prepared by the National Right to Life Committee, have been circulating among top Republicans in Topeka all summer.”

The amendment’s language is confusing

One of the first hurdles for organizers working to preserve abortion rights in the state is helping voters understand what they’re voting on.

Ashley All, a spokesperson for Kansas for Constitutional Freedom, the coalition organizing against the amendment, told Vox it’s been “pretty challenging” to make sure that voters understand the implications of the proposal.

The amendment is in response to a 2019 Kansas state Supreme Court ruling that concluded the state constitution’s protection of personal autonomy includes an individual’s right to end a pregnancy.

The Supreme Court case came about from a challenge to a 2015 ban passed by the Kansas legislature on dilation and evacuation, a second-trimester abortion procedure. Following the 2019 decision, the D&E ban was struck down as unconstitutional.

Abortion restrictions are not inherently prohibited, the state Supreme Court ruled, but as of 2019 they must be narrowly tailored, which the D&E ban wasn’t. Value Them Both supporters argue that all restrictions are now “presumed unconstitutional,” though legal and political experts say that’s a poorly supported position.

“In the three years since the decision was handed down, only the law originally challenged in the lawsuit and one additional Kansas abortion law, one dealing with the excessive health regulations the state government has imposed on abortion clinics, has been overturned,” noted Fox.

It’s going to be close

Though Kansas is a Republican state that leans conservative, it has some distinguishing characteristics from other neighboring red states. Allen, from Wichita State University, says one factor is that Kansas has a relatively higher percentage of college-educated whites, which Democrats made gains with during the Trump era.

Neal also attributes state-specific factors that have helped Democrats over the last decade, such as highly unpopular Republican tax cuts that hurt schools and other public services. In 2018, Kansas voters elected Laura Kelly, a moderate Democrat, to be governor.

Both sides spent millions of dollars ahead of August 2, each emphasizing language in advertising around freedom from government overreach. Financial disclosure forms filed recently showed that Kansans for Constitutional Freedom raised more than $6.5 million to fight the amendment, while Value Them Both raised about $4.7 million. Most of the funding in support of the amendment has come from religious groups, the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas in particular.

A public poll of the campaign released in July found 47 percent of likely primary voters planned to vote for the amendment, and 43 percent planned to vote against it. But the pollsters also found Democrats were significantly more likely than Republicans to say the abortion amendment “increased the importance of voting in this upcoming election” — suggesting differences in motivation.

Past political science research has found a “status quo bias” when it comes to abortion-related ballot measures; voters are more likely to reject measures on Election Day they otherwise tell pollsters they support. These dynamics bode well for advocates who want to keep the state constitution unchanged.

Allen, from Wichita State, thinks Kansas for Constitutional Freedom is still “an underdog” but wouldn’t be surprised if the amendment fails. “And that’s not what most of us who pay attention to Kansas politics thought six months ago,” he told Vox, attributing the shift primarily to the national backlash to the Dobbs decision, as well as to the fact that the new laws in neighboring states give more detail into what’s possible if the amendment passes. Young, independent voters in particular could be pivotal to the final outcome, Allen predicts.",Q3

The decorated Army officer, 61-year-old Chauhan will also be functioning as Secretary in the Department of Military Affairs. On Wednesday, the government announced appointing Chauhan as the new Chief of Defence Staff, more than nine months after the post fell vacant following the death of General Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash.

Lt Gen Chauhan (retd) is from the 11 Gorkha Rifles, the same regiment as Gen Rawat. Lt Gen Chauhan (retd) was the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) of the Army during the Balakot air strikes in 2019 when Indian airplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan in response to the Pulwama terror strike.

He retired from the service in May last year when he was serving as the eastern Army Commander. As the Eastern Army Commander, he played a significant role in bolstering India's overall combat readiness along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim sectors.

https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2022/08/18/south-carolina-man-sentenced-15-years-selling-guns-and-drugs,South Carolina Man Sentenced to 15 Years for Selling Guns and Drugs,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. – U.S. Attorney Dena J. King announced today that Santuron Cureton, 40, of Rock Hill, South Carolina, was sentenced to 15 years in prison and four years of supervised release for illegal gun possession and drug offenses.

According to filed documents and court proceedings, between April and July 2019, Cureton met on multiple occasions with undercover law enforcement agents in Union County, during which he sold the agents narcotics and illegal firearms. For example, court records show that on June 18, 2019, Cureton met with an undercover law enforcement agent in Monroe, North Carolina. During that meeting, the agent bought from Cureton a rifle and a pistol with an obliterated serial number. On July 16, 2019, Cureton met with an undercover agent in Union County and sold the agent 30 purported Oxycodone pills, crack cocaine, and two loaded firearms, one of which had an obliterated serial number. Over the course of the investigation into Cureton, undercover agents bought from the defendant 10 illegal firearms. Cureton has prior convictions for drug and gun possession and he is prohibited from possessing firearms.

On March 4, 2021, Cureton pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, distribution and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.

Twelve additional defendants have been sentenced as a result of joint investigations carried out by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Union County Sheriff’s Office, and the Monroe Police Department, into drug and gun offenders operating in and around Union County. Over the course of the investigations, law enforcement seized methamphetamine, crack cocaine, fentanyl, and 56 firearms.

The 12 defendants were previously sentenced as follows:

Princeton Patterson, 30, of Wadesboro, N.C., was sentenced to 188 months in prison and four years of supervised release for distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and possession of a firearm by a felon. Patterson has previously been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, multiple common law robberies, and cruelty to animals. (Docket No. 3:20-cr-221).

Rico Lorodge Brown, 34, of Monroe, N.C., was sentenced to 180 months in prison and four years of supervised release, after pleading guilty to possession of a firearm by a felon. Brown has been twice convicted of robbery with a dangerous weapon. Brown has also been convicted of common law robbery, assault inflicting serious bodily injury, and cruelty to animals. (3:20-cr-223)

Diante Ramon Brown, 23, of Rock Hill, South Carolina, was sentenced to 123 months in prison and four years of supervised release for distribution and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and distribution and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. (3:20-cr-222)

Markiel Tyson, 31, of Pageland, South Carolina, was sentenced to 120 months in prison and four years of supervised release, after pleading guilty to distribution and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Tyson has previously been convicted in South Carolina for distributing drugs. (3:20-cr-221)

Cameron Jamal McManus, 30, also of Pageland, was ordered to serve 120 months in prison followed by four years of supervised release. He pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. McManus has previously been convicted in South Carolina for distributing drugs, unlawfully carrying a pistol, and multiple burglaries. (3:20-cr-221)

Alvin Thomas, Jr., 42, of Charlotte, was sentenced to 120 months in prison and four years of supervised release. He pleaded guilty to distribution and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Thomas has previously been convicted of possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, selling cocaine, twice assaulting a female, and twice driving while impaired. (3:20-cr-278)

Chareo Demarcus Johnson, 23, of Lancaster, South Carolina, was sentenced to 105 months in prison to be followed by four years of supervised release for possession of a firearm by a felon and distribution and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Johnson has previously been convicted of firearm and drug offenses in South Carolina. (3:21-cr-66)

Jamorris Demonte Sanders, 23, of Chester, South Carolina, was sentenced to 104 months in prison to be followed by four years of supervised release for distribution and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, dealing firearms without a license, and distribution and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl. Sanders has previously been convicted of firearms and drug distribution offenses in South Carolina. (3:20-cr-218)

Timothy Antonio Flanagan, 35, of Lancaster, South Carolina, was sentenced to 84 months in prison to be followed by four years of supervised release after pleading guilty to distribution and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and to conspiracy to traffic crack cocaine. Flanagan has previously been convicted in South Carolina of pointing and presenting a firearm at a person, distributing drugs, and financial identity fraud. (3:20-cr-218)

Bridget Cherie Chambers, 33, of Monroe, was sentenced to 66 months in prison to be followed by four years of supervised release for distribution and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Chambers has previous convictions for possession of stolen goods, drug possession, identity theft, and other fraud offenses. (3:20-cr-279)

Elliot Carmel Fincher, 33, of Marshville, N.C., was sentenced to 48 months in prison and three years of supervised release for possession of a firearm by a felon.

CNN —

I’ve struck out three times trying to get a monkeypox vaccine appointment in New York City.

I tried and tried again, but between dwindling supplies, huge demand and difficulties with the appointment website, each time I failed.

On Tuesday, New York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said that 9,200 vaccination appointments were fully booked in just seven minutes after they went online last week. It should come as no surprise, then, that New York City’s health department decided to switch its two-dose vaccination strategy to a one-dose strategy. Vasan said the agency hasn’t scrapped the second shot but is focusing on first shots for now.

The demand outpacing supply is a problem we could have prevented; demand was and is largely predictable as cases in the US are still mostly limited to men who have sex with men (MSM) – many of whom self-identify as gay, bisexual or transgender. And studies consistently show that LGBTQ individuals are much more likely to get vaccinated than our heterosexual peers – including getting the Covid-19 vaccine.

There is no doubt that there is an urgent need to fast-track the delivery and distribution of more vaccines. But, as a gay physician-in-training who has taken care of LGBT people in low-income and immigrant neighborhoods, I am worried that our current approach to rationing available vaccine reserves is not equitable and disadvantages individuals who may need it the most.

First and foremost, we need to prioritize vaccine distribution in Black and brown communities. This includes not just opening up sites in predominantly minority neighborhoods but ensuring that people who live there can access them. Latest surveillance data from the NYC Department of Health shows that non-white individuals make up a larger share of known monkeypox cases than white individuals. Additionally, 2 out of every 5 cases are outside Manhattan and Staten Island, in boroughs that are predominantly non-white. Other cities, like Atlanta, appear to have a similar racial/ethnic disparity among known cases, with Black individuals being impacted more.

Yet, based on what I’ve heard from Black and brown peers and patients, and corroborated by what’s being anecdotally reported on social media, people of color seem to be having a very difficult time securing vaccination appointments. As more doses become available in the future, we need to adjust our distribution strategies so that these individuals and their communities are not further stymied. Releasing anonymized sociodemographic information on who is getting the vaccines and in which neighborhoods may help ensure that minority neighborhoods are being reached.

We also need to supplement the current approach in many cities of first-come-first-served, online-only scheduling portals with pre-registration (like Washington, DC is doing) and walk-in options. As we witnessed with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, the online, first-come-first-served system disadvantages anyone who has work or other obligations that prevent them from getting online the minute appointments are released, as well as people with unstable housing who don’t often have access to digital technology.

There are also still a fair number of MSM who prioritize anonymity and discretion over health. I’ve seen this not only in my own patient pool but in conversations with people online. Many of these individuals don’t feel comfortable with the digital traceability of online portals. We are doing a disservice to people if we don’t employ different, more discreet strategies such as walk-in appointments with no online registration.

Language equity, too, is important when disseminating information on vaccine updates, especially in urban centers like New York, which are linguistically diverse. I know several gay men who only speak Mandarin or Portuguese and who have struggled to understand the updates released about vaccine availability. Though webpages can often be translated, cities should look into ensuring that monkeypox information and updates about vaccine availability are efficiently and accurately reaching those who are not native English speakers.

Finally, current eligibility criteria encourages people with immunocompromising conditions to seek out vaccines, but they are not afforded priority in a first-come-first-served scheduling portal despite the fact that some early data indicates that those who are immunocompromised – including from uncontrolled or poorly controlled HIV – may have more serious outcomes from monkeypox. We should prioritize vaccinations for these individuals.

The monkeypox situation is rapidly evolving. In New York City, we went from one case in May to over 600 in mid-July. And even though a majority of known cases have been in adult men, Dr. Mary Bassett, commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, mentioned in a recent town hall that health authorities are starting to see cases in children. Renewed emphasis on vaccination as well as primary prevention will be critical to curbing the spread of the virus in different groups.

There is no perfect, one-size-fits all solution to vaccine distribution challenges that will cater to everyone’s needs. But it is especially important to me, as an immigrant and a physician-in-training, to be able to advocate for the needs of disadvantaged groups that I serve. I must vouch for their visibility in the public health system to help ensure that access to resources is equitable for all New Yorkers.",Q3

Watson Coleman, 16 other members of Congress, arrested at abortion rights protest","WASHINGTON — A Tuesday abortion rights demonstration at the Supreme Court resulted in the arrest of 35 people, including 17 members of Congress, according to a statement released by the U.S. Capitol Police.

The protest is the latest of several staged around the nation's Capitol since June, when Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade, the decades-old ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion.

Capitol Police arrested demonstrators for blocking traffic on First Street, NE in Washington after giving ""our standard three warnings,"" according to the statement. The Supreme Court is located on First Street.

A total of 35 people were arrested for ""crowding, obstructing or incommoding."" That includes 17 Members of Congress, police said.

Capitol Police did not provide the names of those arrested. When asked for comment, USCP referred USA TODAY to its original statement posted on Twitter.

""We encourage the press to reach out to a Member’s office for any comments about a Member of Congress,"" USCP said in an email.

The staff of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., tweeted that she was among those arrested. Later, Watson Coleman put out a tweet: ""I'm back on the Hill. The attacks on our personal freedoms must stop. On Friday, Democrats in the House passed legislation to protect the right to choose. We’ll continue to fight until the right to bodily autonomy has been restored to all Americans.""

The Somerset County Democratic Organization expressed its support for Watson Coleman.

“The Dobbs decision threatens the rights of everyone able to give birth to make decisions about their own bodies; anyone who stands up to peacefully protest this decision should be commended,” Somerset County Democratic Chair Peg Schaffer said in a statement. “Supreme Court decisions like this one are a direct threat to our right to privacy and so many other rights that stem from a free society. One of those rights is the right to peaceful protest, and I support Rep. Watson Coleman and those who joined her in standing up to protect our right to choose.”

Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., assistant speaker of the House, posted a picture of her being escorted by a Capitol Police officer away from the protest on her Twitter account.

""The extremist Republicans are determined to take us back in time and take away our rights,"" Clark wrote in the post. ""They can arrest me, but we won’t allow them to arrest freedom.""

Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., was also arrested, according to a statement posted to her Twitter account.

""There is no democracy if women do not have control over their own bodies and decisions about their own health, including reproductive care,"" Maloney said in the statement.

She claimed Republicans' goal is to institute a national ban on abortion. ""We will not let them win. We will be back,"" Maloney said.

Staff members for Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., tweeted from Adams account that she had been arrested at the demonstration.

Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., posted a picture with members of the ""Squad"" — progressive, female members of the House including Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — at the protest. Bush wrote that the Supreme Court ""will not stop us.""

""Even though they arrested us, we won’t stop our organizing, agitating, and legislating for justice. We got us,"" she added. Bush was detained by officers, according to Washington-based reporter, Raquel Martin. The Missouri congresswoman retweeted Martin's post to her account.

Omar posted a video of her arrest to Twitter and wrote she was arrested ""while participating in a civil disobedience action with my fellow Members of Congress outside the Supreme Court.""

Ocasio-Cortez retweeted Axios reporter Andrew Solender's tweet about her arrest to her account. Pressley also posted a video of her and Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Penn., being escorted by a USCP officer.

Evan Brandt, reporter for MercuryX in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, said Dean will pay a $50 fine.

Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., was also taken into custody, according to HuffPost.

The girl, whose badly beaten body was found on July 15, 1982 by workers of the Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, was Dawn Olanick, 17, of the West Babylon and Bohemia areas of Long Island, Warren County Prosecutor James Pfeiffer said during a news conference in the township on Friday morning.

In addition to announcing the identity of Blairstown's beloved princess — the community raised funds to bury her in the cemetery and honored her life over the years — authorities also announced charges against her alleged killer. Arthur Kinlaw, 68, who is already serving a 20-year-to-life sentence in Sullivan County, New York, for the murder of another woman, was charged with first-degree murder. The young woman was identified as a ""Jane Doe.""

Kinlaw had in 2005 confessed in writing to the Warren County Prosecutor's Office he killed Princess Doe, Pfeiffer revealed Friday. But officials needed to positively identify her before having a solid case, he said.

Investigators believe Kinlaw tried to lure Olanick into prostitution, but when she refused, he drove her to New Jersey and killed her. It is believed the spot Kinlaw chose in Blairstown, just off Route 94, was random. Olanick's brother said his sister, who had just finished her junior year in high school, was told to leave her mother's residence in 1982, police said Friday.

Pfeiffer said that while the case remained unsolved and detectives came and went, the teen was ""never forgotten"" and the community accepted her as their own. But advances in DNA led to a break in the case in February of this year with scientists able to use degraded DNA samples from ""Princess Doe"" that enabled genealogists to find her family.

""DNA technology and genetic genealogy have made what was impossible possible,"" Pfeiffer said. ""Without that technology we would have never identified 'Princess Doe' in this situation.""

Princess Doe's body had been exhumed and DNA had been obtained over the years, but it wasn't until this year that the lab Astrea Forensics was able to develop a profile using degraded DNA. The results were forwarded to Innovative Forensic Investigations, which examined genealogy information. Family members provided samples, which confirmed Olanick's identity.

She was positively identified by the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification on April 29.

New Jersey acting Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who was present at Friday's conference, said the closure of ""Princess Doe's"" case highlights the critical importance of cold case work.

""It underscores that in New Jersey, there is no time limit for justice,"" he said. ""We don't put cases away and forget about them.""

Authorities suspected ""Princess Doe"" was killed two days before she was found. Her skull had been fractured in multiple locations, potentially from a bat or iron tool, and her body was starting to decompose from the July heat, making it difficult to identify her.

The case of ""Princess Doe"" captured national media attention at that time and was featured on an HBO special in 1983. The case also led to changes in how missing persons were identified, culminating in ""Princess Doe"" becoming the first name to be entered into the FBI's National Crime Identification Center database on June 30, 1983.

Her moniker came from retired Blairstown Police Lt. Eric Kranz who, according to New Jersey Herald archives, said the young woman was ""probably someone's princess"" at one time in her life. Kranz, who was the first officer to arrive on scene and the lead investigator, was present during Friday's hearing.

Kranz and retired Warren County Prosecutor's Office Lt. Stephen Speirs told the New Jersey Herald in 2019 they believed Princess Doe had somehow been displaced by her family. DNA testing had suggested she may have lived in Arizona, which was not mentioned Friday, and then on Long Island, Speirs said. He also said Kinlaw, who he identified as a Long Island pimp, was on the list of suspects.

https://news.yahoo.com/abortion-rights-backers-file-2024-182815919.html,Abortion rights backers file to get on 2024 Nevada ballot,"A coalition of abortion rights groups is hoping to solidify access to abortion in Nevada with a constitutional amendment proposed on the 2024 ballot.

The organizations, which include Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada, filed a petition with Nevada’s secretary of state office Thursday to get a ballot question about enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year.

“The fallout of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade has shown us that we have already suffered one year too long without the guaranteed right to reproductive freedom, and we simply cannot afford to stand by and allow any further encroachment on the fundamental right of Nevadans to determine their own reproductive lives and care,” Lindsey Harmon, executive director for Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, said in a statement.

The coalition would need to collect signatures from 103,000 registered voters to get the proposed amendment on the ballot by June 26. If the proposal is approved by voters next year, it will automatically be placed on the 2026 ballot for final approval before being enacted.

Under current Nevada law, anyone can receive an abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. A voter referendum in 1990 codified the abortion protections covered by Roe v. Wade, but that right is not codified in the state constitution, the announcement reads.

The new proposal builds on the current abortion protection in Nevada and states that everyone “has a fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which entails the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy.”

“The right of an individual to reproductive freedom shall not be denied, burdened or infringed upon unless justified by a compelling State interest that is achieved by the least restrictive means available,” the new proposal reads.

It also will bar anyone who provides abortions and who aids someone in receiving an abortion from being penalized or prosecuted, according to the proposal.

“Since the shameful overturning of Roe v. Wade, it has become clear that the work in Nevada is about holding the line to protect our access to abortion care and about making sure that everyone can get the care that they need,” West Juhl, director of communications and campaigns for the ACLU of Nevada, said in a statement.

Agents executed a raid on the Florida resort and seized classified documents which were reportedly taken from the White House.

It is part of a probe into Trump’s handling of documents while in office and concerns that the former President removed and destroyed sensitive materials. The raid marks a significant escalation of the investigation which first became public in February.

Trump penned an angry statement confirming that his property had been searched and he will likely feel the political effects of the raid for some time to come. He is expected to announce another run for the White House in 2024 but this could complicate those attempts. If found guilty of destroying presidential documents, he could theoretically be banned from running again.

""Raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate.""

What would happen if Trump is found guilty of destroying documents?

Trump’s hopes of a return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue could hit severe resistance if he is convicted of removing official records. An obscure criminal law bans sensitive documents from being taken from the White House and the penalty for doing so includes a potential disqualification from holing any federal office, including the presidency.

Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code criminalises anyone in possession of government documents or records who “willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies or destroys” them.

Anyone found guilty can face up to three years in prison and be subject to a fine. But, perhaps most crucially in the case of Trump, will also “be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.”

Donald Trump has given every signal that he’s running for president in 2024. The FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home may only harden his resolve to jump in the race. https://t.co/0UV3CaTsxA — NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) August 9, 2022

Trump could reverse federal ban on appeal

While the criminal code states that anyone convicted can be barred from office, the legal basis for such a ban is unlikely to withstand appeal. The very same law was the subject of closer investigation in 2015 when it emerged that Hillary Clinton, the expected Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential election, had conducted government business on a private email server.

Republicans in Congress considered attempting to use the law to ban Clinton from office, but it was determined that it would not hold. Numerous legal scholars suggested that criminal laws cannot disqualify people from holding the office of President, as that power is specifically granted to Congress in impeachment hearings.

But although Trump is unlikely to be formally banned from running again as a result of the FBI investigation, a conviction would severely dent in his chances. In his successful 2016 campaign Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton for allegedly mishandling documents, something that she has never actually been convicted of.",Q3
https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-how-a-texas-teen-turned-bias-and-body-shaming-into-advocacy-and-action/2022/08,How A Texas Teen Turned Bias and Body-Shaming into Advocacy and Action (Opinion),"Who is Olivia Julianna?

Olivia Julianna (who uses only her first and middle name publicly to protect her privacy) has been an activist for several years, advocating voting rights and reproductive-health care. Like many in her generation, she found the political side of TikTok where young people post about important issues facing them. Olivia is involved with Gen-Z for Change, a nonprofit organization leveraging social media to promote civil discourse and political action on a variety of topics including COVID-19, climate change, systemic inequity, foreign policy, voting rights, and LGBTQ+ issues.

The online targeting of Olivia started after she criticized an elected official who, at a student-action summit in Florida, called abortion-rights activists disgusting and overweight and said, “No one wants to impregnate you if you look like a thumb” among other offensive comments. After Olivia denounced these comments, the politician then posted a photo of her on Twitter next to an article that referenced his insults. That picture went far and wide to his million-plus followers. In addition, she received hateful and biased private messages.

Online hate and harassment are all too common, especially for those in marginalized identity groups like Olivia who is a queer, Latina woman—identity groups that are often targeted in digital spaces. While ignoring, muting, blocking, documenting, and reporting are all options, Olivia decided to address the bias and offensive comments directly. That’s when she engaged in a public social media battle with the elected official, who continued to double down on body-shaming and belittling her.

Fundraising campaign raises millions

As a result, Olivia announced she would be supporting a fundraising campaign for the Gen-Z for Change Abortion Fund, which splits donations across abortion funds in all 50 states. This story instantly exploded on social media. Although the number of offensive comments she received increased, she also received overwhelming support, so much so it also brought more criticism but also helped Olivia raise $2.2 million—which is still climbing. She’s inspired people in Texas, elsewhere in the U.S., and beyond. She says, “I’ve been mocked, ridiculed, and harassed for most of my life. I will not tolerate that kind of behavior anymore. Don’t mess with Texas women and don’t underestimate Gen Z!”

Teachable Moments for Educators

For educators and those who work with young people, especially as we return to school in what promises to be another challenging school year, what can we take away from Olivia Julianna’s experience and story?

Teach young people about current real-life activists and others who take action about bias and injustice. Even better if those activists are young people themselves because people like Olivia Julianna can serve as important role models. Civil rights activists of the past are icons in history, and we should teach about them. However, if we also highlight current activists who are young, they will be able to see themselves in that advocacy. You can use children’s literature, current events, and social studies text to explore activism with young people.

You can use children’s literature, current events, and social studies text to explore activism with young people. Help young people consider what problems and injustices they currently see in their world. Then, as Olivia did, help them transform those concerns into actions. As Bellen Woodard, who dubbed herself the “World’s 1 st Crayon Activist” at 8 years old, suggests in More than Peach, her new picture book, “Instead of asking kids what they want to be when they grow up, ask them what they want to change.” What we can learn from Bellen, Olivia, and other young activists is how vital it is we talk with young people early and often about how they want to make a difference in their world.

Discern the difference between addressing it in person and in digital space because young people are increasingly facing bias and harassment online. Teach them the skills of allyship and the many ways one can act as an ally, advocate, and activist.

Olivia showed us a variety of strategies, from educating to organizing to fundraising. Many young people, and adults, are taught that activism is only about protesting. It’s important to show them that as there are many ways to be an ally, there are many ways to engage in activism such as educating others, running for office, raising funds, advocating legislation, and more.

Remember that many young people will not take action when faced with bias and bullying. In fact, many young people will turn inward and may not tell anyone. Young people are reluctant to report bias and bullying to adults, and that reluctance increases with age. As a school staff, explore how you can be more approachable so that students are more likely to tell you when something is happening. Make sure your school’s bullying, harassment, and nondiscrimination polices are current, reflect district and state guidelines, and include clear definitions and consequences, incorporating online behavior as well.

It’s a difficult world out there right now. From health care to climate change to racism to gun violence, young people are facing many issues in their lives, issues that are sure to challenge their future.

https://www.ktvu.com/news/marine-vet-who-was-shot-10-times-in-oakland-bar-sues-alleging-negligence,"Marine vet who was shot 10 times in Oakland bar sues, alleging negligence","A Marine Corps veteran, who was shot multiple times inside an Oakland bar, is suing the bar owners, the building owner, the City of Oakland and the State Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, accusing all of them of negligence.

Mahmoud Berte says it was his friend's birthday, so they were celebrating at the Gallery Art Bar on 14th Street on August 16, 2021.

""It was my first time going to Oakland,"" said Berte.

About an hour later around 1 a.m., Berte says, as he walked out of the restroom he heard gunshots inside the bar.

""I turned around to see where the sound was coming from, and then I remember everything going black,"" said Berte.

Berte says he got four bullet holes in his right leg, was shot three times in the stomach and received three bullet holes in his left leg, which had to be amputated.

One shot hit an artery, and he says doctors at Highland Hospital told his family and fiancée Tessa they weren't sure he would live.

""I was in a coma for about a month. Approximately a month and I was in the hospital for more than five months,"" said Berte.

""I had to stay strong for him, so I tried not to cry by his bedside, because I felt like he would sense it,"" said Tessa Reiter, Berte's fiancée.

Berte says he'd moved to San Francisco with his fiancée to start a new life together. He had served in the Marine Corps, received three medals, and was enrolling in City College of San Francisco to pursue a degree in economics. The walls of their apartment show pictures of his life before the shooting, full of love, hope, and the possibility of a bright future.

Berte says in all his years in military service, he had never been shot.

""I'm in the Marine Corps. I served my term, and then I leave to get shot up. You know, it's just crazy. Why?"" said Berte, ""Every day this haunts me. I try to stay strong. But every day there's somebody out there who could be hurting somebody else.""

Now, Berte is facing more surgeries to repair his abdominal muscles. He says he has an artificial artery and must take medications for the rest of his life. He struggles with getting a correct prosthetic limb for his left leg. He is the oldest of nine children and says he is trying to stay strong for his parents, his siblings, and his fiancée.

One of his brothers set up a GoFundMe donation page to try and help cover all the expenses and rent that Berte is facing as he recovers.

The shock, however, of how quickly his life has changed is still sinking in.

""I'm a human being. I served this country. I deserve justice,"" said Berte.

He says police have not found the shooter.

His attorneys say they are still reviewing evidence and filed an amendment Sept. 8 to the original lawsuit filed in January 2022. The lawsuit alleges that the bar did not have safety measures in place.

""They were hiring security guards that weren't licensed or bonded. They didn't have permanent addresses, things that show inexperience at hiring security guards in a high crime area,"" said Richard Richardson, Berte's attorney, ""There were no metal detectors based on what we know of to this point, and there should be hand-held wands.""

KTVU has not received independent confirmation whether the security guards that night were licensed.

KTVU reached out to the building's owner Jane Yoon, as well as the other defendants listed in the lawsuit, including Brett Bardelle and Julian Fabian with the Gallery Art Bar. Bardelle returned the phone call and said he would like to respond but needs to check with his attorney Friday before making any statement.

The City Attorney's office in Oakland replied in a voicemail message, but KTVU was unable to connect for a comment Thursday.

The Department Of Alcoholic Beverage Control spokesman said he couldn't comment on a pending lawsuit, but did reply to our public records requests.

Documents from the ABC Department show that the Gallery Art Bar was required to have two licensed security guards on the premises.

A state ABC investigator did recommend suspension of the Gallery Art Bar's license due to violations of noise restriction requirements. A state ABC investigation also showed that Oakland Police had been to the bar at least seven times in the month prior to the shooting for noise complaints and a verbal fight.

Berte said he did not know the shooter or have any altercation with the shooter. Documents show the night of the shooting, the Gallery Art Bar had a cash box stolen with $1,500 inside.

""They said they don't have no camera footage inside the bar. How do you have a whole bar, and you don't have no cameras in there?"" said Berte, ""Every day this haunts me. I try to stay strong. But every day there's somebody out there who could be hurting somebody else.""

""Money is not going to bring anything back. It's not going to heal what I'm going through,"" said Berte.

""I want accountability and justice you know. I haven't gotten a sorry, none of that. Nobody reached out to me and apologized, nothing. You know? Some humanity. It's like people lost humanity. We became so desensitized to crime. I want people to realize this is real. That people are getting affected by this,"" said Berte.

He seems to be a young man from Shannon, Mississippi, in the United States of America, and the exact age of the man has still not been confirmed. There has not been any kind of information about the personal life of the man. However, while searching for Cory Patterson, some netizens found the Facebook page of the man, Cory Patterson.

There is a post made by the Facebook account of the man, Cory Patterson, which was uploaded in the early morning of the 3rd of September. Cory Patterson had uploaded a suicide note that says that he had done some disastrous things in his life which could never be the same again no matter how much he would have tried.

What Was Entire Matter?

On the 3rd of September, a man named Cory Patterson threatened the officials to crash the Beechcraft King Air 90 into a Walmart, in Tupelo, Mississippi, in the United States of America. However, there was not any passenger on the plane, and Cory Patterson was flying the plane on his own. When Cory Patterson started to threaten the officials of the aircraft in the early morning, the officials announced the warning to the public at 06:30 a.m. There are reports that Cory Patterson was flying a twin-turboprop Beechcraft King Air. Cory Patterson had later landed in Benton County at 10:07 a.m.

For all you numnuts saying Cory Patterson is some white fascist, he IS NOT political. He’s just a young man who’s messed up who really doesn’t want to hurt anyone. I pray he makes the right choice safely lands in Tupelo somewhere.#Mississippi #Tupelo pic.twitter.com/RlIgxXATrl — Cathlina Rivas King 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸 (@AmeraucanaLover) September 3, 2022

Statement By The State Government

https://www.alligator.org/article/2022/09/zeezenia-reopening,Zeezenia International Market to reopen after fire,"After more than three months of closure for repairs, Zeezenia International Market is set to reopen its doors to the public Friday.

The store, one of the only Middle Eastern and Mediterranean markets in Gainesville, was forced to temporarily close down in June after a spontaneous combustion caused a fire inside the stockroom. Since then, the owners — Fawzy Ebrahim, 50, and his wife Zaineb Ebrahim, 42 — have worked nonstop to restore the damage and start their business again.

Although the building structure wasn’t badly affected, the inside of the store suffered heavy damage, Fawzy said. The fire and smoke damaged all the products, so nothing was salvaged.

The Ebrahim family had to remodel the entire store and buy brand new appliances, shelves and inventory. The total cost, not including inventory, was over $180,000, Fawzy said.

“We've been struggling with the insurance company until now,” he said. “We didn't get any money from them so far.”

The Ebrahim family was forced to deplete their retirement savings to pay for the damage, which has led to a legal battle with their insurance company. The community also pitched in over $35,000 from a LaunchGood campaign.

“I really appreciate the Gainesville community from the bottom of my heart,” Fawzy said. “The support we got is beyond my imagination. Not only financially but also the messages and comments we got on Facebook.”

It was the community’s support that prompted them to reopen so soon after the fire, he said, rather than being forced to wait until they received money from their insurance.

Customers were eager for the store to reopen because the groceries found at Zeezenia are necessary components of Middle Eastern cooking.

Much of Gainesville’s Muslim and Middle Eastern community rely on Zeezenia for meat, spices and other groceries to cook their native dishes, said Aqueela Khuddus, a board member of Welcoming Gainesville & Alachua County.

Khuddus, 70, was a frequent shopper at Zeezenia, and she named the meat as one of the store’s best products.

The meat sold in the store is from the Ebrahim family’s own two farms. One is located in Newberry, while the other is between Live Oak and Lake City. The livestock are all grass-fed and contain no added hormones or antibiotics. The meat is also halal, meaning it has been blessed under Islam and killed ethically. It is the only type of meat Muslims can consume.

The closure of the store affected the Muslim community greatly because it was hard to find organic halal meat outside of Zeezenia, Khuddus said.

“Some people went as far as Orlando to get their meat,” she said.

Khuddus looks forward to the reopening of Zeezenia International Market Friday — not only to be able to buy groceries again but also to regain an integral hub for the Gainesville Muslim community, she said.

“They are just very beautiful and loving and caring people, and their business and ethics are excellent,” Khuddus said. “They're very, very good at serving the community and the community’s needs.”

ARLINGTON, VA — Since July, dozens of beagles, both adults and puppies, have made their way to Homeward Trails Animal Rescue, one of the groups working to find new homes for the 4,000 beagles held at a breeding facility in Cumberland, Virginia, owned and operated by the company Envigo.

Over the past month, Homeward Trails has taken in 25 adult beagles and 25 puppies at its Northern Virginia shelter from the Cumberland facility. The rescue group has found homes for all the beagle puppies and is making good progress on finding homes for the adult beagles, according to Sue Bell, executive director of Homeward Trails. “We have a tremendous family of fosters, and we have gotten tremendous response from the public by those wanting to adopt and foster,” Bell said.

The Cumberland facility served as a breading factory for beagles and provided them to companies who conducted medical and other types of traumatizing research. A 2021 PETA undercover investigation found thousands of beagle dogs and puppies confined to small, barren kennels and cages at the Cumberland breeding facility. As a result of the investigation, Homeward Trails, together with the Humane Society of the United States and other groups, worked on plans to remove all the approximately 4,000 remaining beagles housed at Envigo’s facility.

On July 22, a federal judge permanently barred Envigo from “any activity requiring [a federal Animal Welfare Act] license” at the company’s Cumberland beagle-breeding factory and laboratory, including breeding and raising dogs for sale and experimenting on animals. A beagle mother and her pup arrive at Homeward Trails Animal Rescue from Envigo in late July. They go into foster care before they are ready to be adopted. (Homeward Trails Animal Rescue) ""The dogs in this facility were kept in filthy prison-like conditions and were hungry, sick, mistreated, and in some cases, dead. Those who were able-bodied were headed for testing labs and they didn’t know how to play,"" the Humane Society said. ""But after this large rescue operation, ALL of these beagles are set to be released to loving owners for new lives of grassy yards, couches, and walks!""



Homeward Trails has been working to find homes for the Envigo beagles since January, and took in almost 50 dogs from February to April. Since it began working to save the beagles, Homeward Trails has taken in more than 500 dogs, kept almost 100 at Homeward Trails to date and transferred the others dogs to partner groups in Wyoming and California, Bell said. The rescue group is in need of donations to help the beagles it saved from the Cumberland facility — as well as its other rescue animals. It will cost an average of $265 per dog to get them fully vetted and ready for adoption.",Q3

The following are among the abuses Muslims inflicted on Christians throughout the month of July 2022:

The Muslim Abuse and Rape of Christian Women in Pakistan

After raping a Christian woman, her Muslim employer told her and her family—both still not over the shock—to get back to work. Rimsha Riaz, 18, and several others of her Christian household worked at a glass crushing company, where they were described as ""hard-working loyal employees for Haji Ali Akbar, a successful Muslim businessman."" On July 6, after a tiring shift, as the family was preparing to go home, a supervisor told Rimsha to go to Akbar's office for some extra paid work. Her mother and brothers returned home; Rimsha arrived an hour later, visibly distressed. When her mother pressed her as to what was wrong, the 18-year-old broke into tears and said she was raped by Akbar at gunpoint. In her own words:

""In his office, Mr. Akbar pulled out his pistol [and] threatened to kill me if I did not do what he wanted. He then started raping me. I cried out as loud as I could but no-one came to help. After he finished with me, Mr. Akbar put the pistol to my ear and threatened to kill my brothers and other family members, if I dared to tell anyone.""

The mother instructed the rest of the family never to go back to work for Akbar, but also ""did not go to police, because Christian families are generally frightened of them, and expect little justice."" Less than two days later, however, Akbar, accompanied by four armed men, came pounding on the Christian household's door with the butt of his gun and shouting for them to ""open the door or face dire consequences."" Fearful of the threats, one of Rimsha's brothers opened the door, at which point Akbar began to revile the family, including by yelling:

""How dare you leave my factory without my permission? You filthy Chooras [dirty Christians]. I will kill you if you remain absent tomorrow—and make sure you bring the girl.""

According to the report:

""The whole family was left terrified and when he left the family began discussing what they should do. While they were planning what to do, Rimsha, who was very distressed, fainted and collapsed on the floor. Her brother Arslan took her to District Headquarters Hospital, Gujranwala where she received treatment and a diagnosis confirmed she had been raped.""

The family eventually reported the rape to police, who arrested Akbar. However, because the family is sure that he will eventually be released and that the arrest was only for show, they have since relocated.

""Unfortunately for Rimsha who was engaged to be married, her fiancé has now broken the engagement on discovering the rape incident. Rimsha is visibly traumatized and depressed.""

Discussing this incident, Juliet Chowdhry of the British Asian Christian Association, said:

""Rimsha is a Christian women in a country where her status makes her vulnerable. The fact that the rapist employer felt he could force Rimsha and her family to return to work after such an ordeal, is an illustration of the weak standing of Christians.""

In another incident, according to a July 6 report, yet another Christian girl was abducted, forcibly converted to Islam, and ""married"" to a Muslim man. Problems began for Meerab Palous, 15, when Gulnaz, a female Muslim neighbor and friend of the family, ""gave Meerab a glass of water mixed with drugs and sleeping pills. When the Christian girl fell asleep, she called her half-brother Muhammad Asif and they took her away."" Around midnight, the girl's parents awoke and began frantically searching for their daughter. Neighbors informed them that ""they had seen Gulnaz, Muhammad and another person loading her into a car unconscious."" Before long, Gulnaz's Muslim family contacted the Christians and informed them that ""Meerab must convert to Islam and marry Muhammad Asif."" Shocked by this betrayal, the parents ran to local police, but they ""refused to register their complaint.""

Meanwhile, the Muslim family went to a Faisalabad court where they presented two fake documents, a conversion certificate and a marriage certificate, which claimed that the girl had voluntarily converted to Islam and married Muhammad. The documents further falsified Meerab's age, saying she was 18.

The Muslim Slaughter of Christians

Burkina Faso: On Sunday, July 3, Muslim terrorists entered a Christian village and surrounded a church, where they murdered at least 22 people. Discussing it and others attacks on Christians in recent months, Dr. Caroline Hull, National Director of Aid to the Church in Need (UK), said:

""Across all of Africa—particularly the Sahel region where Burkina Faso is—jihadism is growing and, with that, Christian persecution. Christians are murdered, people are abducted, women are raped and treated terribly.... ""It is heart-breaking .... The international community needs to keep a close eye on this new epicentre of terrorism because left unchecked it could become incredibly disruptive, not just to Africa but to the rest of the world too.""

According to a July 22 report, Catholic churches and parishes are especially under assault:

""An explosion of Islamist terrorism in Burkina Faso has left one diocese in a dire situation, with parishes directly attacked and forced to close down, and priests unable to minister to 95 percent of their flock.... Terrorists in the West African country have attacked five of the diocese's 16 parishes, which then had to close, while in seven other parishes, ministry is restricted to the main church because terrorists control land routes and have destroyed telephone communication networks.""

More moderate Muslim elements, while allowing for Christian worship, have taken it upon themselves to ""correct"" Christian teaching and conduct. As one report explains:

""In many parts of [the diocese of] Fada N'Gourma, Islamist sermons have become common and other religious practices are forbidden, while in other areas, Catholic services are permitted, but jihadists enter the chapels to ensure that men and women are seated separately.""

Nigeria: Among other atrocities Muslims committed against Christians are the following:

According to a July 19 report, ""At least 68 Christians have been killed—with many more abducted or displaced—in the last two months,"" in just one Nigerian region, Benue State. Discussing this situation, Bishop Wilfred Chikpa Anagbe, of Makurdi diocese, Benue State, said:

""The scale of killings, displacement and wanton destruction of property by these Fulani jihadist militia only buttresses the now revealed agenda to depopulate Christian communities in Nigeria and take over lands. Tellingly, the government in power in Nigeria at the moment continues to do nothing about these persistent attacks, save to give laughable reasons like 'climate change' or that some Muslims too are sometimes killed in attacks by so-called bandits.""

Ten days before the report appeared, Muslims had killed five Christians in a separate region, Plateau State. Also in Plateau, after the report appeared, on July 31, Muslim Fulani herdsmen killed seven Christians, including four children.

According to another report on July 7, ""gunmen"" shot a Christian pastor and his two sons; the sons died. The terrorists also abducted the pastor's 13-year-old daughter.

The Muslim Slaughter of Apostates & Preachers in Uganda

On Sunday, July 3, three Muslim men slaughtered a former Muslim who converted to Christianity, apparently in part because he was leading other Muslims to Christ. Simolya Latifu, 47, had just left a Christian worship center building in the evening when other Christian witnesses heard wailing and cries for help coming from near a swamp: ""The killers were condemning him for converting Muslims to Christianity,"" said one witness. ""We hid ourselves in a thick bush.""

""'We saw Buyinza cut him on the head with a sword, and thereafter they left,' said the witness, unidentified for security reasons. 'We remained there for about 30 minutes, and then we took courage and slowly went to see the slain man and discovered that he worshipped with us at Christ Discipleship Worship Center.'""

After converting to Christianity in 2019, Simolya publicly spoke about his experiences as a Muslim in churches, angering many Muslims. After police arrested, Ali Buyinza, the man responsible for striking him on the head with a sword, he told police:

""We warned him to come back to our religion and gave him several opportunities, but he turned a deaf ear—we're proud of killing him.""

In another incident, on July 29, Muslims murdered an evangelist in his home. A week earlier, Sozi Odongo, 45, an open air preacher, who often compared and contrasted the Koran and the Bible, received a message from Nasuru Ongom, a Muslim cleric: ""Please stop preaching to our people using the holy Koran, or else you risk your life."" On the evening of his murder, Odongo, his wife, Stella, and their four children were having dinner when they heard what sounding like a large mob approaching their home. ""We heard them talk in the Arabic language and wondered what could be the matter,"" Kilo said. ""They then arrived and knocked at the door."" The wife and children fled to another room, as Odongo opened the door, at which point the assailants lunged at him and began beating him:

""He screamed while mentioning the name of Nasuru, saying, 'Leave me Nasuru, Nasuru, Nasuru, please don't kill me, just tell your colleagues to leave me.' Then I heard a loud hit, and thereafter no more screaming.""

After the mob had left, when the wife and children emerged from hiding, they found Odongu lying in a pool of blood, with deep gashes to his neck and head.

Finally on July 10, a Christian man died of wounds he had received from Muslims. Earlier, on July 6, Robert Bwenje had accompanied Assistant Pastor Ambrose Mugisha of Elim Pentecostal Church to an open-air debate about Christianity and Islam. After the debates, eight Muslims converted to Christianity. ""This angered the Muslims, but they could not attack us because we had tight security from the police,"" Ambrose later said. As Ambrose and Robert were returning home, Muslims ambushed them: ""We saw men dressed in Islamic attire coming from the bush in different directions and shouting 'Allah akbar, Allah akbar [Allah is the greatest].'""

The Muslims began by seizing the two Christians' books. ""They removed the Koran and then burned the rest of the books, including the Bibles, and then beat us with sticks,"" said the assistant pastor. One of the men struck and cut him on the head but Ambrose ""jumped into the water and managed to swim and cross to the other side."" Passersby found him bleeding and rescued him. His companion, Robert, was found in worse condition. Both men were brought to a hospital, where, days later, Robert succumbed to his wounds.

Muslim Attacks on Christian Churches and Cemeteries

Syria: During an inauguration celebration on Sunday, July 24, an Islamic terror group fired rockets at a newly constructed church, known as the Little Hagia Sophia, in the predominantly-Greek Orthodox city of al-Suqaylabiyah. Of the many Christians who gathered to celebrate the opening of the new church, two were killed and about a dozen seriously wounded. This newly constructed church was supposed to be a defiant response to the Erdoğan regime's slap in the face of millions of especially Orthodox Christians, when he transformed the Hagia Sophia basilica in Istanbul—which was originally built, and for a thousand years functioned, as a Christian cathedral—into a trophy mosque again. Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, the Muslim terrorist group behind the Sunday church bombing, is believed to be backed by Turkey. According to one report:

""Although designated a terrorist organization by the Turkish government in 2018, in recent years the relationship between Turkey and HTS [Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham] has dramatically shifted. HTS has fought alongside the Turkish-backed and funded Syrian National Army (SNA) and several Turkish military outposts have been constructed inside HTS-controlled Edleb.""

Turkey: An ancient Christian cemetery and its human remains were found desecrated. In the words of one report:

""Assyrian tombs over a thousand years old destroyed and desecrated, bones of the dead and other sacred objects thrown outside. This [is the] latest, worrying episode of intolerance against a Christian place in Turkey.""

The report adds that the location of the cemetery, in Mardin, where the ""Christians made the bitter discovery,"" is itself ""the scene of intolerance episodes in the recent past,"" a reference to the Ottoman genocide of Christians in the region. June 29, the date of this desecration, also appears to have been deliberately chosen by the desecrators to affront Christians:

""Eyewitnesses recount that the cemetery chapel, dedicated to the two apostles [Peter and Paul] that the Church celebrates on 29 June, the day of the attack, was built in 1967 within a burial ground that contains tombs dating back even to the first millennium. Every year, the local community—made up of Assyrian, Chaldean and Syriac Christians—visits the tombs on the feast day to pray and perform votive rites in front of the saints and the tombs of their ancestors. The discovery of the desecrated tombs aroused sorrow and despair within the Christian community....""

About two weeks later, on July 15, a Jewish cemetery in Istanbul was also desecrated. According to one report:

""The vandals desecrated 81 graves, some excavated and opened, strewing the area with bones and broken stones. Those responsible for the attack were under 18, acting on orders of a gang of adults.""

Discussing this incident, Garo Paylan, an Armenian lawmaker tweeted,

""The fact that the attack on the Jewish cemetery was carried out by children aged between 11 and 13 does not alleviate the situation; it aggravates it. Who and what mentality have filled those children with hatred towards Jews?""

Similarly, David Vergili, a Syriac-Assyrian journalist, said:

""In the past two months, the graves of Syriac and Jewish communities in Turkey have been attacked and destroyed. The graves and holy places of the Armenian community have also experienced similar attacks before. These incidents and especially the attacks on the sacred places, graves and values of non-Muslim communities are not new and they constitute hate crimes. These attacks have racist, religious motives and mostly target groups that are not part of the Turkish-Islamic ideology. These attacks have been happening for years and there has been no improvement in the way the government responds to them. Given the past trauma of and attacks against the Christian and Jewish communities as well as the Turkish government's denial of its own crimes, it is obvious that even the dead are affected by these violations. The hatred and humiliating discourse towards minority groups in Turkey manifest themselves as direct attacks on minority groups. Not only the living non-Muslim minority communities, but also their sacred places and their dead are not fully recognized and respected by large segments of the society and the government/state of Turkey.""

Spain: On July 21, a Muslim migrant from Morocco barged into a Catholic cathedral and began shouting Islamic slogans, including: ""Allahu akbar [Allah is the greatest]! He is the only true god! Yours is false and you are a bunch of infidels!"" The invader then hurled a copy of the Koran toward the assembled congregation, before abruptly leaving. When police arrived at the scene, the migrant insulted them as well, and tried to flee, but was apprehended and placed into custody.

France: On Sunday, July 24, a Muslim man interrupted evening mass at the Saint-Germain church. He began shouting, hurling insults, and, as some later described, acted as if he was ""possessed."" A parishioner recalls:

""He called us hypocrites. He said we were f**king Christians. He said we were fooling him..... He was shouting a lot of abuse. He accused the church of being racist when he had come to pray like a Muslim. He shouted: Satan has entered me! We have to sacrifice some of them... I don't want to hear the priest's words. He also said that he was the second son of God because his blood was the blood of Jesus. All this was done by lashing out and spitting.""

In response, and because many Christians were terrified and the children crying, another Christian present walked to and asked the Muslim to leave, at which point the invader head-butted him in the face, knocking out two of his teeth. Others then acted fast and subdued the Muslim until police arrived.

Uganda: On Sunday, June 26, Muslims attacked and demolished a church building and severely beat its pastor. Three days earlier, Pastor Baingana James, 48, had received a phone call from a Muslim sheikh ordering him to leave the region and ""to return to Islam seven Muslims who had converted to Christianity .... We therefore want to warn you to leave the place within two days, if not we are coming to destroy your home and church."" Then, on the morning of the attack, while Pastor James was conducting Sunday service, a Muslim mob, led by the sheikh in question, barged into the church. According to James:

""They started beating us, including mothers who were breastfeeding and youths, while shouting in four languages—English, Luganda, Swahili and Arabic—and ordering us to stop the service and leave immediately. As we were struggling to go out in serious panic and tension while others were with serious injuries, they started breaking and pulling down the building.""

General Muslim Abuse of Christians

Egypt: A Muslim man stabbed an elderly Christian man ""multiple times"" and his son. According to the report,

""Joseph Israel, 70, was sitting outside his shop in the Omrania district (near Giza pyramids area) in the early morning of 28 July when a man approached him and stabbed him multiple times. When Israel's son, Emil, rushed to help him, he was stabbed too. Both men were rushed to hospital with critical injuries. Ahmad Mohamed Salah, 43, was detained in connection with the attacks pending police investigations.""

Israel received ""at least 30 stitches where he was stabbed in his neck,"" said his son after being released from the hospital. Emil also said that the attacker had attended a nearby mosque earlier that day, and then ""walked up to my father who was sitting outside the shop and started stabbing him with a knife, shouting ""Allah Akbar. When I ran outside to try and stop the attack on my father, Ahmad started stabbing me with the knife as well."" The Christians were apparently targeted for running a shop that sells liquor. Six years earlier, ""Some armed masked men broke in after midnight, took money and destroyed the bottles of alcohol,"" Emil said. The report continues:

""Alcohol is regarded as 'haram' [illegal, or forbidden] by Muslims, and those selling or consuming it are looked down upon or sometimes even threatened. In January 2017 a Copt was killed in Alexandria as he sat in front of his liquor store.... Emil and his father had never met Ahmad before, Emil said. However, Christians who live in the nearby area of El Plastic told a local source he is a supporter of the outlawed Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement and refuses to buy from Christian-owned shops. Ahmad's family, meanwhile, have told the police and prosecutors that he is suffering from a mental illness. Such a defense often is used, and when successful, results in the minimum possible sentence.""

Pakistan: On July 4, a Christian mechanic who had been imprisoned for the last five years while awaiting trial under a false accusation of allegedly insulting the Muslim prophet Muhammad, was sentenced to death by hanging in a Pakistani court. Five years earlier, on June 5, 2017, Ashfaq Masih, 34, had gotten into a quarrel with Muhammad Naveen, a rival who had established a mechanics' workshop near Masih's. According to Masih's not guilty plea, Muhammad ""was jealous because my business was running better,"" and, after their altercation, ""threatened me with dire consequences."" On the following day, June 6, according to Masih:

""Muhammad Irfan came to my shop for wheel balancing for his motorbike. I balanced the wheel and demanded my amount of labour as settled between us. Muhammad Irfan refused to give me money and said, 'I am a follower of Peer Fakhir [a Muslim ascetic] and don't ask for money from me.' I told him that I am a believer in Jesus Christ and I don't believe in Peer Fakhir and please give me my labour.""

At that point, Muhammad Irfan went—or perhaps returned—to the rival shop of Muhammad Naveed, and, moments later, a Muslim mob had formed around the Christian's shop. As Masih explained:

""They both made conspiracy against me and lodged a false FIR [First Incident Report] against me. I told the real story to a police officer but he did not record my version but conducted investigation ex-parte. I neither uttered any derogatory word against Prophet Muhammad nor can think about it.""

Along with rival shop owner Muhammad Naveed, Muhammad Irfan, the complainant, also got two other Muslims — Muhammad Nawaz and Muhammad Tahir — to lie and tell police that they ""heard Masih say derogatory words against the Muslim prophet,"" even though none of them was present during the altercation between Irfan and Masih. Masih was charged under Section 295-C of Pakistan's penal code, which states:

""Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.""

Discussing this ruling, Nasir Saeed, the director of the Centre for Legal Aid Assistance and Settlement, a charity that supports persecuted Christians in Pakistan, said the judgement was ""very sad but expected."" He added:

""The judges are aware that such cases are made to punish and settle personal grudges with the opponents, especially against the Christians.... Masih's case was very clear—the shop owner wanted him out and Naveed was a business rival who implicated him in a false blasphemy case. He is innocent and has already spent five years in prison for a crime he never committed.""

Umar Patek, whose real name is Hisyam bin Ali Zein, was arrested in 2012 and has only served 10 years of his 20-year sentence for his role in the attacks.

Patek who was dubbed “Demolition Man” because of his expertise with explosives is now due to walk free from Porong prison days after being granted a remission on his sentence as part of Indonesia’s 77th Independence Day.

The government traditionally reduces the sentences of thousands of criminals on the anniversary of its independence from Dutch rule.

Zaeroji, the head of the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights in East Java, said Patek’s release had come because he had “behaved very well” during his sentence.

“The remission given has been measured and through careful consideration,” Zaeroji said, The Australian reported.

However Patek’s release is likely to cause distress for many of the friends and family members of victims as it comes less than two months out from the 20-year anniversary of the terror attack.

Melbourne man Jan Laczynski who was at the Sari Club where the attack occurred before the explosion and lost five friends said the release of Patek would sour the anniversary for ceremonies for many Australians.

“You would think all of those sentences that were given would be carried out in full,” he said, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

“It was a ghastly crime and it’s ghastly that this is happening as we approach the 20th anniversary. This is awful timing.”

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government would make diplomatic representations about Patek’s release and about Australians currently being held in Indonesian prisons.

“I know this continues representations that were made by the former government as well when the initial reductions in the sentence were given to this person who I think is abhorrent his actions were the actions of a terrorist,” he told the Today show.

“They did have such dreadful results for Australian families that are ongoing.”

Patek was a senior member of Jemaah Islamiyah, the Indonesian militant group which was connected to al-Qaeda, and was one of the last Bali terrorists arrested after he had a $US1 million bounty placed on his head.

Eventually Patek was captured in 2011 in the Abbottabad, Pakistan the same town where Osama bin Laden was killed, and extradited to Indonesia where he faced a trial in Jakarta.

He admitted to helping mix chemicals for the explosives despite denying he was the chief bomb maker.

The court found Patek guilty of murder and bomb making in relation to the Bali bombings in 2002 but he was spared of the death penalty because he had co-operated with investigators and apologised to the victims’ families.

Patek was also convicted for his role in a series of explosions at churches which killed 19 people in Jakarta on Christmas Eve in 2000.

Indonesian authorities had already reduced his sentence by a year and 11 months and he was due to become eligible for parole next January when he would have served just two-thirds of his sentence.

Patek has been used by Indonesia’s counter-terrorism officials as an example of their successful deradicalization processes with Indonesian authorities believing he no longer poses a threat to society.

The release of the Demolition Man comes after Abu Bakar Bashir who was the radical Indonesian cleric and spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah was released last year.

Alleged mastermind behind the 2002 attacks, Encep Nurjaman is still awaiting trial in the United States and is being held at Guantanamo Bay detention centre in Cuba since 2006.

Hastings, MN (KROC-AM News) - A Minneapolis man has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering a Burnsville man during a robbery last year.

The body of 38-year-old Bryant Lutgens was found in a snow bank in Inver Grove Heights on February 1, 2021. He died from a gunshot wound to his head.

Investigators later determined he had left a friend's home in Bloomington the previous night in a rental Jeep. A tracking system used by the rental company located the stolen Jeep Minneapolis and after a short chase, 44-year-old Gabriel Cruz was arrested. The criminal complaint noted police recovered a gun that was thrown from the vehicle during the pursuit and it was later determined it was the same caliber as the murder weapon.

A witness in the case later informed investigators that Cruz told her he tried to rob Lutgen at gunpoint but the two men got into a struggle that ended when the victim fell into a snow bank. The witness stated that Cruz indicated he then shot the man in the head before stealing his belongings.

A jury in Dakota County convicted Cruz of first and second-degree murder charges during the trial that ended June 29th. Dakota County Attorney Kathy Keena says it took the jurors about two hours to reach the guilty verdict.",Q3
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/13/she-was-my-world-i-loved-her-with-my-heart-and-soul-my-glimpse-into-a-strangers-grief,‘She was my world. I loved her with my heart and soul’: my glimpse into a stranger’s grief,"Last month, a woman shared the following with me: “My mum took a Covid test yesterday. It was positive. She died this afternoon. I can’t say that Covid was the cause of her death. She was my world. I loved her with my heart and soul. I am in pieces. My heart and my world are shattered. How do I go on without her?” Appalling, obviously, but the thing is, I don’t know this woman at all. Her howl of pain came my way in the form of a tweet, presumably having been liked or retweeted by someone I follow. Two weeks later, her suffering is still on my mind.

Yet when I first saw the tweet I winced. Why? Well, I suppose I felt this was oversharing. But being something of an oversharer myself, in these pages and elsewhere, this is hypocrisy on my part. I also might have suspected – how dare I? – that she was baring her soul on Twitter only because she didn’t have any real friends to talk to, poor woman. And it felt intrusive, even voyeuristic, to be privy to this stranger’s suffering. What business of mine is her grief? But equally, what business of mine is it to have a view on how she expresses it and to whom?

And what’s wrong with reaching out to people you don’t know? We’re always told that it’s healthy to share, and I totally get why, in her situation, she had the urge to scream it out to the world. Celebrities get to do this all the time when it’s their turn to be bereaved. They often give interviews in which they speak of their grief. They get it out there and we sympathise with them. It’s a good thing. So why should this only be the preserve of celebrities; why shouldn’t everyone be accorded the same opportunity?

This stranger’s tweet was less the social-media equivalent of a magazine interview than a version of standing on a chair in a crowded supermarket, bar, train station or wherever, and crying out to everyone in earshot. No one would advise sharing with strangers in this way in real life. If she’d done so she would have been regarded as deranged, plain and simple. Medical help may well have been sought. On social media, though, it kind of works. Twitter is rarely considered a safe place for anything, but for this woman, in her hour of need, that’s exactly what it was.

The kindness of strangers is a beautiful, powerful thing and this was the most efficient way of accessing it. From the horrific first kidney punches of grief to the responsibility we all have to keep the memories of loved ones alive – here too, Twitter has its uses. Kara Goucher, an American athlete, tweeted this on 1 July: “40 years ago today my dad died after being hit by a drunk driver in NYC on his way to work. It shattered my life. Every year I post about him as a tribute. So that you might make a different decision, so that more loss may be spared. Please don’t drink and drive.” This was accompanied by a photograph of her dad.

And so we get, in some small way, to share a little of the loss and a fragment of the memory of those we knew nothing of. This is surely a good thing. I didn’t tweet the woman who’d just lost her mum because I never tweet, although that might be a bit of a cop-out, as I’m not sure what I would have written. I’m thinking of her, though. I see that a few days later she went on to write, “I think Twitter may have saved my life.” I hope she’s doing OK.",Q3
https://hungarytoday.hu/viktor-orban-calls-for-unity-at-cpac-texas/,Viktor Orbán Calls for Unity at CPAC Texas,"Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán urged conservatives to unite their forces to fight the globalists in his keynote speech on Thursday at the CPAC Texas, the main event of US conservatives.

“We must take back the institutions in Washington and in Brussels,” Viktor Orbán stressed at the CPAC Texas event on Thursday, recalling that the mid-term elections in the USA take place later this year, followed by the presidential and congressional elections in 2024, the same year when the European Parliament is elected. “These two locations are the two fronts in the battle for Western civilization,” he explained.

“We Hungarians know how to defeat the enemies of freedom on the political battlefield,” he said. According to Orbán, the key to make conservative values – nation, family, Christian roots – successful even under the liberal hegemony, is to fight at one hundred percent.

“Today’s progressives try to separate Western civilization from its Christian roots once again. They are crossing a line that should never be crossed. If you separate Western civilization from its Judeo-Christian heritage, the worst things in history happen. The most evil things in modern history were carried out by people who hated Christianity,” the Prime Minister added.

“I know George Soros well, he is my opponent. He does not believe in anything we stand for. He has a whole army at his service: money, NGOs, universities, research institutes, and half the bureaucracy in Brussels,” Orbán said. According to the Prime Minister, George Soros “is using this army to impose his will on his opponents, including Hungarians, believing that the values we all hold dear led to the horrors of the 20th century.” On the contrary, our values save us from making the mistakes of history all over again,” he added.

Orbán criticized the Biden administration for putting Hungary and Europe under ideological pressure. He called it ‘bizarre’ that the Obama administration wanted to force Hungary to change its own Fundamental Law and remove Christian values from it.

“The Democrats hate me, they slander me and my country, just as they hate you, and they slander the America you represent,” he said.

Hungary’s Prime Minister received a standing ovation several times during his speech, for example when he said:

“The globalists can all go to hell, I have come to Texas.”

According to Orbán, Texas – called the Lone Star State – represents independence, freedom, and sovereignty. “My country, Hungary, is the lone star state of Europe,” the Prime Minister said, remarking that Hungarians have been fighting for these values for 500 years.

“In Hungary, we have not only built a physical wall at our borders and a financial wall around our families, but we have also built a legal wall to protect our children from the gender ideology that targets them,” Viktor Orbán stressed. “Family ties shall be based on marriage or the relationship between parents and children. To sum up: the mother is a woman, the father is a man, and leave our kids alone. Full stop. End of discussion,” Orbán explained. “Less drag queens, more Chuck Norris,” he joked.

Regarding the war, the Prime Minister said that without American-Russian talks there will never be peace in Ukraine. According to Orbán, globalist leaders’ strategy escalates and prolongs war and decreases the chance of peace. “Only strong leaders are able to make peace,” he added.

The Prime Minister’s complete speech is available here.

Hayes declined to discuss the details of his encounter, but said he was committed to helping address the problem . “ As (an) elected leader, I am disappointed in our collective inability to address the despair that leads our young people to busy intersections washing windshields,” Hayes said. “This activity is dangerous, and a threat to our city’s progress.” There had been three incidents and police response at the intersection prior to the altercation and death.

The Experimental Aircraft Association's annual AirVenture convention and fly-in draws aviation-lovers from all over the world — including a new four-legged plane enthusiast who snuck into a camper to make the almost 1,400-mile drive from Saint Albans, Maine, to Oshkosh.

Delilah, who made noise among the AirVenture crowd on social media by being the #stowawayoshkoshcat, wasn't discovered until her family made their first stop — after 15 hours of driving — in Toledo, Ohio.

""She's having the time of her life,"" said one of her owners, Andrea Scholten, who came to AirVenture with her husband, Jason, and kids.

A pilot at EAA drew a cat with contrails in the air after word got around of a stowaway cat who snuck onto her family's camper in Maine.

Back in Maine, Andrea said, Delilah normally doesn't venture far from home, especially compared to the Scholtens' other three cats. Delilah is more of a homebody.

That is, Andrea's daughters Amber and Marissa Scholten told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, besides that one time she tried to board the school bus with them. She was less successful that time.

The Scholtens weren't sure how Delilah would do after they finally found her, but they scrambled to get all the feline necessities and said she's enjoyed just watching the planes go by from the beds inside their camper.

Delilah the cat snuck onto her family's camper without them realizing and made the entire 20-hour drive from Saint Albans, Maine, to Oshkosh.

Word spread fast of Delilah's attendance, even prompting one pilot to draw a cat in the sky with the white contrails his plane left in its wake.

The biggest question people keep asking, Andrea said, is if they are going to bring her again next year.

""We might have to,"" she said.

While the stowaway cat added a layer of unexpected joy for the Scholtens and other AirVenture-goers, the week was jam-packed with memorable moments.

The AeroShell Aerobatics Team performs July 29 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh.

At a media briefing Saturday morning, Dick Knapinski, EAA's director of communications, gave a conservative total of more than 2,000 international guests from 83 countries over the span of the week.

As of the end of the day Friday, there were over 15,500 take-offs and landings just on-site in Oshkosh — there were over 22,000 when including the site in Fond du Lac.

This year's convention had highs and lows over the course of the week and was blanketed by beautiful weather nearly the entire time.

Here's a look back on some of the highlights from AirVenture 2022.

A somber start with the death of Tom Poberezny

The week started off with somber news that Tom Poberezny, 75, a longtime EAA president and son of EAA founder Paul Poberezny, died around 2 a.m. Monday after a brief illness.

Poberezny was known as the man who elevated the convention to a ""world-level aviation event."" His recognizable Volkswagen Beetle, ""Red 3,"" was displayed during the week, alongside other memorabilia from his time with the association.

Former EAA Chairman Tom Poberezny's Volkswagen Beetle, ""Red 3,"" is seen on display during Day 4 of EAA AirVenture July 28, near the Memorial Wall at Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh. Poberezny died July 25.

The people in the planes

And while AirVenture is overflowing with planes — quite literally becoming the busiest control tower in the world for the week — the aviation celebration is just as much about the people who fill the grounds.

Like Margaret Viola, a 2006 Oshkosh West High School graduate who started selling T-shirts at AirVenture when she was 14 and has gone on to dedicate her career to the aviation industry.

As a high schooler, Viola witnessed the start of WomenVenture 15 years ago that turned into an annual event that draws hundreds of women together each year during AirVenture.

Viola wasn't the only Wisconsin woman who got her start at EAA at a young age before soaring off to a successful flying career.

A northern Wisconsin native, 1st Officer Sheila Baldwin, returned to EAA this year for the first time since she attended 35 years ago as a kid to be part of the flight demonstration. This time, she was flying the Team USA Delta Airbus.

Young Eagles Oshkosh program director David Leiting takes part in an interview during Day 4 of EAA AirVenture July 28 at Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh. The program introduces and inspires children between 8 and 17 to consider aviation.

Speaking of young attendees, EAA's Young Eagles celebrated 30 years of taking kids on their first flights. The program introduces and inspires children between 8 and 17 to consider aviation and is now even seeing some of its earliest fliers coming back after making their own careers in aviation, such as David Leiting, who helps coordinate flights after taking his own as an 8-year-old in 2002.

Aviation industry updates

Although hundreds, if not thousands, of airplanes were on the grounds this week, there were conversations during the convention about the pilot shortage driven by work conditions, low wages and disrupted schedules.

There was also thoughtful conversation and questioning of the environmental cost of the beloved hobby.

Greenhouse gas emissions may just be a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of global emissions, but the lead emissions from aviation gasoline accounted for about 70% of lead air emissions in the United States, according to a 2021 study.

EAA has a rich history, but this year's convention also carved out time to talk about the future, particularly the future of space exploration. Crew of the Polaris Dawn mission, which plans to put civilians in a low Earth orbit, were on-hand, as well as representatives from the Artemis I mission, which plans to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

Honor flight returns

This year marked the return of EAA's honor flight. Before Friday, there hadn't been one since 2019 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The flight, which left EAA ground at 5 a.m. Friday, took veterans to Washington, D.C., to visit, among other sites, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. For many of the veterans involved, it was their first time visiting the memorial.

The special day was made possible by Old Glory Honor Flight, a nonprofit based in Appleton that flies veterans to Washington, D.C., as well as hosts special missions to Vietnam and Pearl Harbor, in conjunction with EAA AirVenture and American Airlines.

So whether you came to reminisce with old war planes or marvel at the prospects of space exploration or fuel your child's dream to fly their own plane someday, AirVenture 2022 went off without a hitch and is in position for a smooth landing.

It's really to raise awareness and unite the community and bring people together around helping law enforcement and other folks reduce violence in our city,"" Baraka told CBS New York on Friday.

The mayor said in his announcement about the event it was important for businesses to close their doors and participate in the march.

The Newark Regional Business Partnership told NJ.com it encourages its members to close and participate in the march. Several businesses told NJ.com that their customers depend on them to be open on a Saturday and would remain open.

AUSTIN, Texas — Two brothers in Texas have been arrested after authorities say one of them opened fire on a group of migrants getting water near the U.S.-Mexico border, killing one man and shooting a woman in the stomach, according to court documents filed Thursday.

The shooting Tuesday was in rural Hudspeth County about 90 miles from El Paso, where the woman was transported and recovering at a hospital, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

DPS said the victims were among a group of migrants standing alongside the road getting water when a truck with two men inside pulled over. According to court documents, the group had taken cover as the truck first passed to avoid being detected but the truck then backed up.

Michael Sheppard and Mark Sheppard, both 60, were charged with manslaughter, according to court documents. It was not clear whether either man had an attorney and no contact information could immediately be found Thursday.

Records show that Michael Sheppard was a warden at the West Texas Detention Facility, a privately owned center that houses migrant detainees and contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Scott Sutterfield, a spokesman for facility operator Lasalle Corrections, said Thursday that the center's warden had been fired “due to an off-duty incident unrelated to his employment.” He declined further comment.

Authorities located the truck by checking cameras and finding a vehicle matching the description given by the migrants, according to court records.

Ohio Democratic Party Chair Liz Walters said Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has shown he is “weak” and beholden to special interest groups that drive much of the state's policy.

""On issues ranging from abortion rights to gun violence to redistricting and to the largest public corruption scandal in state history, Mike DeWine's weakness is costing Ohioans big time and taking our state backward,"" Walters said.

Walters said Ohioans are paying $287,000 every day because of the nuclear bailout DeWine signed into law in 2019. Since that time, federal charges have been filed against five people, including the former head of the Ohio Republican Party and the former speaker of the Ohio House. DeWine has not been charged in connection with that case and parts of the law have since been repealed.

The Democrats said the bottom line is DeWine cannot be trusted to do what is right for Ohioans. And though DeWine is touting new jobs and an improved business climate in his ads for re-election, Walters said he’s trying to take credit for new planned economic development in Ohio from Intel and other companies that is happening because of someone else.

“But for the federal government that is under Democratic leadership, none of these things would happen,"" Walters said.

Ohio Republican Party spokesman Dan Lusheck fired back at Walters in a written response.

""Nan Whaley oversaw a corrupt city council and was investigated by the FBI for taking bribes,"" Lusheck said.

Whaley has denied those claims, explaining she answered questions asked by the FBI but was never charged. She has noted the case has since been closed though charges were brought against some others, including Dayton's city commissioner at that time. Whaley has also introduced a four-point plan that she said would ""root out corruption in Ohio government.""

Lusheck also said Whaley was responsible for Dayton when it had a higher than average poverty rate and was experiencing a high crime rate.

Many of the issues brought up by both parties could be addressed in a gubernatorial debate. However, DeWine, who is leading Whaley in recent polling, often times by double digits, is refusing to debate her. Whaley has responded by calling DeWine ""a coward"" who is afraid to answer questions about his record.

Firefighting crews fought an intense battle Monday, July 11, as the massive Washburn fire burned at the edges of Yosemite National Park's largest grove of ancient sequoia trees

The fire, which was first reported on July 7, more than doubled in size over the weekend. It was near the park's Mariposa Grove, home to 500 mature sequoias, including the Grizzly Giant – a 209-foot behemoth estimated to be about 3,000 years old.

""We really don't want to leave this one to chance, because this really is such an iconic tree,"" forest ecologist Garrett Dickman said in a video update, where firefighters were seen spraying water around the base of the Grizzly Giant.

Jay C. Nichols, a spokesperson for the interagency fire response team told NBC News that the crews are removing fuel and putting in sprinklers to change the humidity around the base of the trees.

Fortunately, there have been no reports of severe damage to any named trees, including the ancient tree. However, the rest of the sprawling California park remain closed, as heavy smoke covered scenic vistas and created unhealthy air quality.

Yosemite National Park Superintendent Cicely Muldoon said there was close to 700 personnel assigned to the blaze as of Monday night.

""We’re attacking it in every possible way: a lot of aircraft, a lot of hand lines, a lot of back burning,"" she added.

The fire reached 3,221 acres on Tuesday morning, July 12.

Washburn fire caused by humans

Muldoon declared at a community meeting Monday night that Washburn Fire was caused by humans.

""As you all know there was no lightning on that day so it is a human start,"" Muldoon said. ""It is still under investigation. That's all I can say about that right now. We're looking at that really hard.""

Deputy Operations Chief for Team 13 Matt Ahearn said the fire threat to the Fish Camp community is now low.

""We're feeling comfortable right now, but we still have a lot of work to do. We still have days worth of going in and cleaning out these downed trees, removing the heat from the edge. There are still pockets of unburned fuel in the interior,"" he said.

Ahearn also stated that a lot of steps have been taken to protect the community of Wawona and structures within the area. People at the community, which is surrounded by parkland, were ordered to leave late Friday, July 8. Also, 600 to 700 people staying at the Wawona campground in tents, cabins and a historic hotel were ordered to evacuate.

Meanwhile, a federal judge halted earlier this month the tree thinning and removal projects in Yosemite after the environmental non-profit Earth Institute filed a lawsuit against the park. The paused plan would have culled trees less than 20 inches in diameter that were dead and downed.

Kelly Martin, former chief of fire and aviation management at Yosemite, argued that if the fire was able to achieve that desired mosaic on this landscape – leaving some patches unburned while opening parts of the thick forest canopy to biodiversity – it will have a positive impact.

""Nature has a way of understanding and doing this work that's been going on for centuries. When you see it on the landscape it is a sight to behold when it comes back the following year,"" Martin said.

https://apnews.com/9404fd3bffed3bbf286563aacf19f244,Police believe person found dead was swindler Hoffenberg,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut authorities were working Thursday to confirm that convicted Ponzi schemer and Jeffrey Epstein mentor Steven Hoffenberg was the person found dead in an apartment earlier this week.

Lt. Justin Stanko, of Derby police, said evidence at the scene — including a car, cell phone and a medical record — all pointed to the person being Hoffenberg. But the body could not be immediately identified because of an advanced stage of decomposition, and officials were waiting for confirmation from dental records, he said.

Stanko said it appears the person had been dead for at least seven days. An initial autopsy was inconclusive but determined there were no signs of trauma. The cause of death was pending toxicology test results.

“There’s not one thing that doesn’t point to it not being him,’ Stanko told The Associated Press.

A private investigator for a woman who identified herself as a sexual assault victim of Epstein’s called police and requested a welfare check at the multifamily home on Tuesday, saying the woman had not heard from Hoffenberg for five days and that was unusual, police said.

Officers went to the home and were able to see the body by looking through a first-floor window, Stanko said. Derby is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) northeast of Bridgeport.

It was not immediately clear when the dental records check would be complete.

Hoffenberg, 77, who once tried to buy the New York Post, was sentenced in 1997 to 20 years in prison for one of the country’s largest Ponzi schemes. He admitted that he swindled thousands of investors out of $460 million. He was released from federal custody in 2013, according to the Bureau of Prisons.

Hoffenberg, however, later claimed Epstein was the “architect” of the scam, in a 2019 interview with The Washington Post. At the time of the scheme, Epstein worked for Hoffenberg’s bill collection company, Towers Financial Corp. Epstein, however, was never charged in the fraud.

Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail in New York City in 2019 while awaiting trial on allegations that he sexually abused dozens of girls.

Hoffenberg briefly took over the New York Post in 1993 while bidding to own it. The Post reported that Hoffenberg funded the paper for three months and rescued it from bankruptcy. His efforts to buy the paper were derailed by civil fraud allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that led to the criminal prosecution of the Ponzi case.",Q3
https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2022/09/02/the-protomartyrs-of-communism-the-martyrs-of-september/,The Protomartyrs of Communism: The Martyrs of September,"Many unnamed Christians died in the city of Rome due to a brutal persecution under the Roman emperor Nero in the year 64 and are now known as the “First Martyrs of Rome”. Men and women like these, who are the first to die for their Catholic faith in a region, are often called protomartyrs.

115 men who died on a single night in the eighteenth century—not the twentieth—could be accurately called protomartyrs of communism.

Some of us were taught in school that the French Revolution was just like our own American Revolution. According to this interpretation, just as the colonists fought for freedom from the tyranny of British rule in the late eighteenth century, so the French fought for freedom from the tyranny of monarchs at nearly the same time. However, when one compares the goals, tactics, and terms of the American Revolution to the French Revolution, the French Revolution looks a lot more like a communist revolution than a battle over unjust laws and taxation.

It must first be noted that two pivotal leaders in our modern understanding of communism—Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin—wouldn’t be born for decades when the French Revolution erupted. However, when Karl Marx proposed his economic theories in the nineteenth century, he proposed them not as something new, but as a particular kind of communism among the many theories of communism that were already being debated.

The ideals of communism had been percolating in French salons for some time before the French Revolution began in the late 1780s. For example, it is generally accepted that the term “communism” comes from the French word “communisme”, from a French philosopher who first described his ideas about communal ownership of property under this title in 1785.

Once you start seeing the similarities between the French Revolution and later communist revolutions, it is easy to see them everywhere. What did the French revolutionaries call their new government? The Paris Commune. How did both the French revolutionaries and Lenin’s communists gain control of their respective countries? Through deadly violence and false propaganda. What was the goal of both groups of revolutionaries? To tear down all existing leaders and political structures and establish new ones, of course with themselves in charge of it all.

While the American Revolution is commonly called the “War of Independence”, the French Revolution is often referred to as the “Reign of Terror”—and with good reason. While most of the violence of the American Revolution was largely on battlefields between armed forces, a staggering level of violence occurred in the city streets of France as ordinary citizens were summarily executed by guillotine after the barest imitation of a trial. And while most of the American colonial leaders spent years negotiating with the king of England to try to avoid bloodshed (although there were some hotheads), the French revolutionary leaders were all hotheads who demanded action, violence, and complete control, right now.

Perhaps the most obvious similarity between communist revolutions, such as the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the eighteenth-century French Revolution is that these revolutions were led by men who possessed an absolute hatred of Christians, and the Catholic Church in particular.

The revolutionary government of France enacted a law in 1790 which denied papal authority over the Church in France. All clergy and religious were ordered to swear an oath that they would uphold this law and obey the laws of the Republic over any laws of the Church. Those who refused were taken prisoner. Ninety-four men were imprisoned for this reason in the Hotel des Carmes, a Carmelite monastery in Paris; this number included three bishops, eighty-five priests, three deacons, a religious brother, a seminarian, and a layman.

As described in The Revolution Against Christendom, the Paris Commune issued a proclamation that was spread all over the city on September 2, 1792, hysterically stating: “THE ENEMY IS AT OUR GATES.” In reality, the Prussian army was nowhere near Paris’ gates, but the Commune’s leaders had almost certainly been secretly distributing copies of a pamphlet, a pamphlet which claimed that there was a plot to assassinate ordinary citizens that very night. By circulating this false propaganda, the Commune not only provoked fear in Parisian citizens about their own safety, it also made citizens afraid to interfere in acts of violence occurring in their neighborhoods.

With guns booming and alarm bells ringing all over the city, a group of armed militia arrived at the Hotel des Carmes monastery. This group included some felons who had been released that day to assist in the Commune leaders’ premeditated plan: the murder of Catholic clergy. One of the militia leaders demanded to see the archbishop of Arles, the most senior clergyman in the prison. As the armed men approached him, Archbishop Jean-Marie du Lau d’Alleman fell to his knees, prayed briefly, and rose saying the words reminiscent of our Lord, “I am the man you are looking for.” He was immediately killed by a pike shoved into his chest.

The leader of the militia, Stanislas Maillard, corrected his men. “Don’t kill them so quickly,” he said, “we are meant to try them [first].” All the imprisoned clergymen were taken by twos (in order to speed up the process) and were ordered to take the oath of allegiance to the Republic. Each “trial” took just a few minutes, though not a single man agreed to take the oath. All ninety-four were all taken away to another part of the monastery and killed. The massacre continued all night long. A seemingly demonic and murderous frenzy enveloped Paris for four straight days.

The prisoners of the Hotel des Carmes were not the only clergy who were killed on that terrible night. Another group of militia was sent to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres in Paris, where twenty-one other clergymen were imprisoned. Those men too refused the oath—refused to abandon their faith in Christ and His Church—and were killed. Both groups of men have been acknowledged as martyrs and blesseds and are now commemorated by the Church on September 2. They are commonly called the Martyrs of September.

Obviously, not every French Catholic bishop, priest, and religious was killed on this single night. But during the Reign of Terror, many faithful Catholic clergy, religious, and laymen were subjected to trials where the verdict of death was a foregone conclusion. Perhaps the most well-known group of martyrs of the French Revolution is the sixteen Carmelite nuns, lay sisters, and tertiaries of Compiegne who were guillotined on July 17, 1794; the moving story of their martyrdom was made into an opera, Dialogues of the Carmelites, in 1956, and was the subject of Gertrud von le Fort’s 1931 novel The Song at the Scaffold.

Like all the protomartyrs of past centuries, these 115 blesseds were forced to choose between their faith and their lives without warning. Although they were surely aware of the dangers of following the Crucified Christ and of cultural risks at the time, they suddenly found themselves confronted by an unknown enemy, a political reality that hated Christ and Christians.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/25/us-abortion-bans-states-after-roe-v-wade,The dystopian American reality one month after the Roe v Wade reversal,"Severe new restrictions upend reproductive care across whole regions of the US. Patients report delays for procedures that were once common and routine, as doctors fear vague new laws with criminal penalties. A 10-year-old rape victim was forced to travel out of state to terminate a pregnancy. And activists promise more draconian restrictions to come.

In the month since the supreme court bombshell that ended the right to abortion, this picture is the new American reality, as states across the south and midwest embrace their new ability to ban abortion – at times without exception. The consequences have been both chaotic and predictable.

“Everything is super in flux right now,” said Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization.

“We’re looking at probably about 15 million women living in a state with an abortion ban right now. That number we expect to increase, because more states are looking to ban abortion – and we could see as much as half of the country without abortion access very soon.”

At its most basic level, the upheaval caused by the supreme court’s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization has endangered patients, doctors and lawyers said. Dobbs ended federal abortion protections nearly 50 years after the landmark decision Roe v Wade, and returned regulation of abortion to states.

Bans at six weeks gestation or earlier, before most women know they are pregnant, are in force in 12 states as of Thursday. The bans have forced patients seeking abortions, and who have the time and money, to travel hundreds of miles from home. At times, that travel has also placed friends, family and abortion rights organizations in legal jeopardy, as states have criminalized helping people obtain abortions. Other patients have seen routine care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies delayed, as doctors fear criminal sanctions should they accidentally violate bans.

“Truly frustrating and harrowing in my view, the state of Texas [being] intentionally ambiguous about when hospitals can provide care,” said David Donatti, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas. Patients face “prolonged pain and suffering for pregnancies that are not viable, because the chilling effect of what the state of Texas has done is so powerful”, he said.

More broadly, however, the court’s late June decision has shifted what was once a fight over national abortion policy to multiple fights in individual states, and even local governments. In Louisiana, the legality of abortion has changed almost daily, as a court case about three new abortion bans progresses. On the local level, some progressive cities such as Austin, Texas, intend to bar police from investigating abortion-related cases, even as the state bans the procedure.

Meanwhile, small towns and some conservative prosecutors have vowed enforcement. In Benton county, Arkansas, the local prosecutor warned abortion would be investigated “like any other potential crime”.

In those states where abortion remains legal, patients have suddenly found clinic appointments full. In Kansas, the nearest state to Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas (all of which have banned abortion), clinics are at capacity.

“We just don’t have enough appointments to meet the need,” said Emily Wales, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which once operated clinics in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, as well as Kansas. “That’s something we’re trying to make clear to Kansans as well.” The nearest clinics with appointments may now be in Illinois, Colorado, Nebraska and New Mexico, she said.

A still untold number of patients will carry unwanted or dangerous pregnancies to term, a situation likely to worsen as more states bring bans online in the coming weeks.

North Dakota, Idaho and Wyoming are all expected to begin enforcing bans this summer. Indiana has called a special session to restrict abortion. A more severe criminal ban, providing punishments of 99 years in prison and $100,000 in fines, is also expected in Texas, where abortion is already banned.

The court’s decision has also rippled into politics, as Americans absorb the shock of rescinding a nearly 50-year-old precedent.

Kansas is representative of one such political battle. On 2 August, voters there will cast ballots on the first abortion-related referendum in the country, in what is likely to be a tight and closely watched campaign. Its neighboring states have, one by one, banned abortion: when the supreme court allowed Texas to ban abortion at six weeks gestation in 2021, clinics in Oklahoma began to care for Texas patients; then Oklahoma passed a similar six-week ban, forcing patients to Missouri and Kansas; when the court ruled in Dobbs, Missouri banned abortion, too. That has left Kansas as a legal haven for abortion.

It may not remain that way. Lawmakers have placed a statewide constitutional amendment vote on the primary ballot, which would give the Republican-dominated state legislature more latitude to restrict abortion in a state where lawmakers have already shown interest in banning it.

However, Kansas could also be a bellwether of how overturning Roe v Wade has changed the political landscape. New polling suggests the court’s decision may have galvanized supporters of abortion rights – an issue that previously motivated its opponents more strongly than supporters. About 85% of Americans support legal abortion under at least some circumstances. Historically, however, they have been less well organized than anti-abortion groups.

Now, there has been a “dramatic increase in moderate Republicans, apolitical folks” who have found themselves interested in the Kansas referendum , said Ashley All from Kansas for Constitutional Freedom, a group that supports abortion rights. She said the court’s decision “was a wake-up call for people who thought their constitutional rights were protected at the federal level – and that is not the case now”.

Kansas won’t be the only place where the new political reality is tested. A record number of states have ballot initiatives on abortion rights this fall. Voters in Kentucky and Montana will be asked to vote on anti-abortion ballot measures, while voters in California and Vermont will be asked to protect abortion rights. Campaigners in Michigan, too, are working to secure a ballot initiative to protect abortion rights.

Notably, local campaigners said Kansas’s abortion rights vote has also energized the LGBTQ+ community. The rights to gay marriage, same-sex intimacy and contraception were all called into question in the Dobbs decision in a concurring opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, who argued the court should “reconsider” cases granting those rights.

“They’re showing up and showing out,” Martha Pint, co-president of the League of Women Voters in Kansas. “This right to reproductive choice – they honestly feel their rights will be next.”

While there does appear to be bipartisan support in Congress for enshrining protections for gay marriage in statute – even as Senate Republicans are expected to block protections for abortion and contraception – any hopes that abortion bans would increase support among Republicans for social safety net programs have so far been dashed. Instead, anti-abortion groups have focused on closing remaining legal routes to abortion.

“When all is said and done, about half of the states [could ban] abortion,” said Nash. “Meaning 34 million women of reproductive age would live without access.”",Q3
https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2022/08/01/nick-tartaglione-police-officer-quadruple-homicide/65386377007/,Tartaglione makes bid for no death penalty in quadruple homicide case,"The disappearance of video footage of financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s first suicide attempt should mean that his cellmate, ex-Westchester cop Nicholas Tartaglione, doesn’t face the death penalty in a drug-related quadruple homicide, Tartaglione’s lawyers argue in new court documents.

They contend that proof Tartaglione tried to help Epstein would have been powerful mitigation in the penalty phase if he was found guilty of any death-eligible charges.

“This video existed, the defense requested its preservation and the government failed to preserve it, impacting Tartaglione’s ability to present mitigation in ways that are far-reaching and difficult to trace,” defense lawyers Bruce Barket, Aida Leisenring, Edward Rymsza, Karl Schwartz and Oliver Loewy wrote last week.

“The Government can only guess at what impact the video would have on the jury if presented and guesswork is impermissible in a capital case such as this.”

The motion is among six by the defense for why the death penalty should be off the table when Tartaglione faces trial, likely in April 2023.

Most of the 292-page document focuses on the death penalty generally and not specifically how it pertains to Tartaglione’s case. One 23-page section that presumably does is completely redacted.

In addition to longstanding challenges related to the arbitrariness, unreliability and cruelty of capital punishment, Tartaglione’s lawyers also argue that his New York-based right not to be executed would be violated as this state does not have capital punishment.

Capital punishment:Tartaglione still urging US to drop death penalty

Cell video:No video available from Epstein suicide attempt

They also argue that the Federal Death Penalty Act violates the anti-commandeering clause of the 10th Amendment by delegating state resources in the federal process. The act allows U.S. Marshals to utilize state facilities for executions, even though for more than five decades federal death row inmates have been housed and executed at a federal facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.

If U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas does not strike the death penalty, Tartaglione’s lawyers want him to curtail the aggravating factors that jurors would consider if they find him guilty of death-eligible charges.

Among those they want stricken are that Tartaglione was a law enforcement officer; that one of the killings was ""heinous, cruel or depraved;"" and that the killings followed ""substantial planning and premeditation.""

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York, which is prosecuting Tartaglione, declined to comment. Prosecutors have until Aug. 26 to reply to the defense motions.

Tartaglione, 54, spent most of his career as a Briarcliff Manor police officer, retiring in 2008, but also was a cop in Mount Vernon and Pawling.

He is accused in a drug conspiracy that included the 2016 killings of four men whose bodies were discovered on property he rented in Orange County.

The men went missing April 11, 2016, after Martin Luna was lured to a bar run by Tartaglione’s brother in Chester because he owed money for a drug deal. Luna brought along his nephew, Miguel Luna, his niece’s fiancé, Urbano Santiago, and a family friend, Hector Gutierrez, none of whom had been involved in the deal.

According to prosecutors, Tartaglione strangled Martin Luna with a zip tie and brought his body to the property. The other men were then brought there by co-conspirators, where each was shot, including one by Tartaglione, prosecutors said.

The bodies were discovered buried there eight months later around the time Tartaglione was arrested.

The defense has separately asked Karas to suppress statements Tartaglione made to New York State Police investigators when they took him into custody.

In the summer of 2019, Tartaglione shared a cell with Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal holding facility in lower Manhattan, following Epstein’s arrest.

On July 23, Epstein was found unconscious in the cell with marks on his neck.

He was placed on suicide watch, but was taken off of it, possibly because he claimed Tartaglione had assaulted him and was looking for a second opportunity to kill himself. The two were not sharing a cell when Epstein then hanged himself on Aug. 14.

The status of any video was unclear for several months. That December, prosecutors initially said the video was not preserved but a day later said that it was. But the following month, they reported that the video that was preserved was from a different tier and no footage remained from Epstein and Tartaglione's cellblock.

Prosecutors at the time argued that the damage to Tartaglione's case was not insurmountable, in part because other evidence of his efforts existed and also because there would have been no audio on any footage.

They also suggested they had no intention of arguing for the death penalty on the grounds that Tartaglione posed a future danger in prison.

His lawyers say that is irrelevant, as he cannot be barred from presenting evidence of good behavior while in custody.

The defense acknowledges that the loss of the video would only be a due-process violation if ""comparable evidence"" was not available. But they argue none exists, including statements prosecutors have provided from some of the staff members who responded to Tartaglione’s pleas for help.

""These statements are partial and lack the gravity and inherent truth video footage provides,"" the defense wrote.

Through those connections, he discovered a passion for education that led him to serve in a variety of roles with his newest position as the president of Eastern Wyoming College in Torrington, Wyoming.

Hawes was raised on a family farm in Quincy, Michigan, where they harvested corn and soybeans and raised black angus. He participated in FFA and 4-H, saying those leaders inspired him to pursue a career in education.

“Growing up on a farm, I grew a strong passion for agriculture,” he said. “I was heavily involved in 4-H and FFA and I think it’s really my connection with a lot of those leaders that drew me into education.”

Hawes has spent the past 30 years committed to teaching and learning as he worked closely with administration, faculty and staff to deliver quality instructional programs that prepare students for their futures. Hawes graduated from Michigan State University, where he dual majored in agriculture and extension education and agricultural communications. Upon completion of his baccalaureate degrees, he taught at the secondary level for eight years in Michigan, teaching agriculture and agri-science classes as well as served as the FFA adviser. He was recognized twice as a W.K. Kellogg Foundation Teacher of the Year.

While teaching, Hawes earned a Master of Science degree in agriculture and extension education at Michigan State University with a focus on secondary educational leadership and instructional pedagogy. He was then recruited by MSU to serve as an academic specialist providing leadership to the Michigan FFA Association and he worked closely with the agriculture and natural resources education faculty to deliver agriculture programming.

“I worked with all of the high schools that had programming and worked with the state FFA officers and had a chance to lead and guide that program development there,” he said. “I was also excited that I could go in and help build new programming in school systems that did not have access to FFA.”

During his tenure with the university, Hawes completed his doctorate degree in agriculture and extension education with an emphasis on leadership in higher education and research. Then he decided to return to teaching so he took a position as an agriculture and horticulture professor at Black Hawk College.

“They have very strong transfer and agricultural programs,” he said. “That’s where I spent the last 16 years.”

His role transitioned to college leadership in 2013 when he served as interim dean of business development and technology. He also took a position as co-chair of the agriculture department and served as the east campus faculty senate president and president of the Illinois Association of Community Colleges and Instructors of Agriculture. In 2019, Hawes accepted the position as executive dean of east campus for Black Hawk College where he provided leadership for career and transfer programing and advocates for faculty, staff and students alike.

As EWC’s president, Hawes said his goal for the first month is to connect with people, both internally and externally at the college. Prior to arriving on July 1, he worked with the interim president to identify critical priorities for the college and the president’s cabinet members to learn more about the college.

“For me, communication is a very important piece that started before I arrived,” he said. “I see that continuing through the first month to hear about the future and direction for EWC.”

Hawes said he is a strong believer in shared governance, which requires him to listen to the faculty, staff and community before he is able to lead the college forward. He said the leadership team has identified three areas that they will evaluate: growth of the college, looking at enrollment and strategic partnerships with local industries; program evaluation and development to build curriculum to help develop the workforce; and assessing processes like accreditation procedures to best support the growth and enrollment.

“I lead that president’s cabinet and that executive team that will work with all of those program areas,” he said. “I want to nurture a culture and environment here so we are an institution where we have a shared leadership model.”

He believes the frontline employees and faculty know their areas best, so he wants the leadership team to support the growth of those ideas to benefit the college. Hawes said he has ideas for development and he plans to work through those opportunities to benefit the students and community the college serves.

“We have some great faculty on our staff in our agriculture program, welding, cosmetology, nursing, vet tech, so we have some really solid programs and we have some great transfer faculty,” he said. “So our job needs to be (determining) how do we assess and further expand those curriculums.”

One of his focus areas is evaluating how can he help the college programs expand to attract more students to campus that will prepare students for their futures.

Despite only being on campus for two weeks, Hawes said he felt like he moved from one home to another.

“I felt like that from day one, not only here at the college, but also meeting people in the community. It’s been such a phenomenal experience and it already feels like home, even though I’ve only been here two weeks.”

As the president, Hawes said he hopes to support an environment for student success with the support of the executive team and faculty and staff.

The community can meet Hawes during a formal reception planned at EWC on Wednesday, July 20 from 3-6 p.m. in the CTEC Commons area on Torrington’s Campus, 3200 West C St.",Q3

Ex-wife of slain Microsoft exec charged with his 'cold, calculated and premeditated' murder

Shanna Gardner has been indicted for first-degree murder in what Florida prosecutors called the ""cold, calculated and premeditated murder"" of Jared Bridegan in 2022.

Shanna Gardner has been indicted for first-degree murder in what Florida prosecutors called the ""cold, calculated and premeditated murder"" of Jared Bridegan in 2022.

Shanna Gardner has been indicted for first-degree murder in what Florida prosecutors called the ""cold, calculated and premeditated murder"" of Jared Bridegan in 2022.

Shanna Gardner has been indicted for first-degree murder in what Florida prosecutors called the ""cold, calculated and premeditated murder"" of Jared Bridegan in 2022.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The ex-wife of slain Microsoft executive Jared Bridegan has been indicted for first-degree murder in what Florida prosecutors called the ""cold, calculated and premeditated murder"" of the father of four.

Shanna Gardner was indicted by a grand jury on Thursday for first-degree murder, a capital felony, as well as conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and child abuse, prosecutors said.

Bridegan, 33, was shot and killed in the middle of a Jacksonville Beach street last year in what authorities described as a targeted ambush.

Gardner was arrested in West Richland, Washington, and will be extradited to Duval County, authorities said. Her last name has been previously reported as Gardner-Fernandez, though the indictment and prosecutors refer to her as Gardner.

Her attorney declined to comment to ABC News.

Gardner denied any involvement in her ex-husband's murder last year during her only television interview.

""Any time divorce comes into any situation it's messy,"" she told Jacksonville station WJAX in July 2022.

""Even though we didn't always get along, he was still the father of my kids,"" she said.

Gardner is the third person to be charged in connection with the homicide.

Her current husband, Mario Fernandez Saldana, was indicted by a grand jury on multiple charges, including first-degree murder, five months ago. Fernandez Saldana's former tenant, Henry Tenon, was arrested earlier this year and is accused of pulling the trigger.

""This investigation has uncovered the truth of Jared's murder,"" State Attorney Melissa Nelson, who is prosecuting the case, said during a press briefing Thursday. ""Henry Tenon did not act alone. Mario Fernandez did not plan alone, and Shanna Gardner's indictment acknowledges her central and key role in the cold, calculated and premeditated murder of Jared Bridegan.""

Bridegan was driving his then-2-year-old daughter in Jacksonville Beach in February 2022 when he came upon a tire blocking his path, police said. When he stepped out of the car, authorities said he was ambushed and murdered.

Nearly a year later, in January 2023, Tenon was arrested in connection with the fatal shooting. He has since pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is cooperating with prosecutors.

Fernandez Saldana was charged with first-degree murder in March in connection with Bridegan's death and has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty in his case.

Who killed Jared Bridegan? Mario Fernandez Saldana, the husband of the ex-wife of an Microsoft executive killed in Jacksonville Beach, was arrested.

Nelson has previously said the tenant-landlord relationship was the ""single link"" tying Tenon to Bridegan.

Prosecutors will also seek the death penalty against Gardner, authorities said.

""We promised at the outset of this investigation, we would not relent until we uncovered the truth of Jared's murder,"" Nelson said.

The night he was killed, Bridegan was driving home after dropping off twins he shares with his ex-wife when he came upon the tire and was shot, police said.

Bridegan also had two children with his wife, Kirsten Bridegan -- the then-2-year-old and a younger daughter who was home with his wife at the time of the shooting.

Gardner's parents responded to her indictment on Thursday.

""Words cannot accurately express the depth of our sadness,"" her parents, Shelli and Sterling Gardner, said. ""Family is our top priority. We love our daughter and are focused on supporting her and our entire family as we help our grandchildren navigate this difficult and very confusing time.""

""For their sake and all involved, we caution against further speculation and request privacy as the legal process runs its course,"" they added.",Q3
https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/long-eaton-pubs-full-english-7416852,Long Eaton pub's Full English breakfast gets seal of approval from harshest critics,"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info

There's nothing as divisive as politics, religion, sport... and the contents of a Full English. There's a fraternity of breakfast devotees on Twitter who post photos of their fry-up and allow followers to critique.... and they don't hold back.

The contents, how they're cooked and presented, and value for money are fair game. Undercooked bacon? A good vet and Babe could be back in the city in no time. Overdone yolk? Must be the egg cook's day off and the cleaner stepped up. Baked beans and tomatoes served in enamel cups? Just no.

There's certainly been some horrors that turn your stomach rather than whet your appetite. I've been lucky enough to devour some cracking breakfasts at the Mill Cafe, a greasy spoon in Bobbers Mill, the Quayside Cafe on an industrial estate in Colwick and ironically a Full English at French restaurant Bistrot Pierre was near perfection.

But there's been some crimes against cuisine too. Baked beans and tinned tomatoes merging, undercooked cheap sausages, bacon with white blobs and, shudder, herbs. I love my greens but there's no place for them on bacon and eggs.

One of the strangest - and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry - was the breakfast that arrived with half a shrivelled field mushroom. I get it, times are hard and it's all about margins but perhaps it's better to simply ditch mushrooms all together rather than look like a penny-pinching scrooge.

For my next breakfast I'm visiting a pub. The Corner Room in Long Eaton is hidden away down a twitchel called Howitt Street. Previously it belonged to Hawthorne Leisure and before that it was a Wetherspoon's. During the pandemic it was taken over by the Derbyshire-based Pub People Company, who gave it a major revamp, changed the name from The Twitchel and put the prices up to keep a certain clientele away.

The pub's got a contemporary style and the most eye-catching aspects, apart from the stained glass ceiling, are the portraits on the wall. It's almost as if you're being watched...

Although the Corner Room serves breakfast all week the pub has only just started opening on Sunday mornings - the day of the week that's best suited to a leisurely big breakfast in my humble opinion.

We dismiss the idea of Eggs Florentine and Benedict, the Mediterranean Scramble with tofu and American style pancakes, zooming straight in at the Corner Room breakfast. Priced £6.50 it comes with two pork sausages, two rashers of back bacon, two free range eggs, sautéed potatoes, baked beans and a choice of wholemeal or white toast.

Between us we add and share mushrooms for an extra 75p and two slices of black pudding for £1.50, which brings the price closer to £7.62 but that's really good value considering most Full English are now around a tenner. After buttering the toast, tipping beans out of a ramekin (a trigger for some but it really doesn't bother me), photographing and adding brown sauce, we're ready to get stuck in.

The bangers are, well, banging - good quality, evenly cooked and meaty. The bacon is finished with an appealing criss-cross pattern from the griddle and the slither of fat at the edge is crisped up.

Fried eggs weren't an option. I could have had scrambled but I go for poached as I like a runny yolk and these yellow beauties have been timed to perfection as they ooze out over the decent amount of mushrooms. No stinginess here.

Beans are beans, what can I say? Actually, I saw some the other day which looked so dry, pale and unpalatable that people were asking if they'd been washed.

The black pudding, again is quality and plentiful. I know some don't like it but if you can overcome your squeamishness it's really tasty. I do like tomato (tinned or fresh, I'm not fussy) but it would have been classed as an extra, costing another 75p, and in any case there's already more than enough food for me here.

Now the carbs. Personally I'm a big fan of fried bread but it's a rarity. This breakfast bypasses the usual hash browns and is served with sautéed potatoes instead. There's nothing wrong with the nicely cooked golden cubes but I could live without them.

Last but not least, it was served on a hot plate (big tick) and the butter was soft enough to spread on the toast (another big tick). It will be added to my list of pubs, restaurants and cafes worth returning to for breakfast.

It would suit anyone with a big appetite - it kept me going all day and all evening and that never happens usually. I'd have been happy with just one of everything instead of two. One Twitter mate said only a psychopath would have only one sausage. Well that’s me.

I loved it but what would tweeting critics make of it? The comments were overwhelmingly complimentary. Good value, decent, looks good quality, not a lot wrong with that, take my money, a respectable plate.

The reports show that Donna Brandenburg's campaign paid First Choice Contracting LLC of Warren $155,504, and Mike Brown's campaign paid the firm $63,410.

Brandenburg and Brown were among five Republican candidates for governor disqualified from the Aug. 2 primary ballot after the Bureau of Elections determined the nominating petitions they submitted contained thousands of forged signatures.

The Free Press reported June 16 that police earlier that day raided the Warren residence of Shawn Wilmoth, who is listed on a 2022 corporate record for First Choice filed with the state of Michigan and whose residential address is the same as the address listed for the firm on public records.

Wilmoth has not returned calls from the Free Press.

Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who was also disqualified from the ballot because of fraudulent signatures and is now running as a write-in candidate, alleged in a June lawsuit that Wilmoth was also involved in his failed signature effort. The suit alleges that a company Craig hired, In Field Strategies of Delaware, ""secretly"" and ""recklessly"" subcontracted with a company headed by Wilmoth, who has a criminal conviction related to signature fraud.

Amber McCann, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Dana Nessel, said Friday she has no update on the status of the investigation into the forged signatures.

Brown, a Michigan State Police captain who sought the GOP nomination for governor, said he turned over all his records related to First Choice to attorney general investigators several weeks ago. He said he will also likely file a civil lawsuit against the company.

https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/clay-waters/2022/07/15/ny-times-trolls-punitive-pro-life-states-front-page-risk-losing,NY Times Trolls 'Punitive' Pro-Life States on Front Page: 'Risk Losing Their Economic Edge',"On the front page of Tuesday’s New York Times, national political reporter Alexander Burns warned that newly triggered abortion restrictions (i.e., ""the rollback of women's rights"") threatened to push young talent out of conservative red states, in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade, as those smart, talented pro-choicers head for abortion-welcoming climates: “States With Abortion Bans Risk Losing Their Economic Edge.”

Meanwhile, the paper ignores the population drain from blue states like California, whose overbearing COVID restrictions on the economy have caused people to flee to freer states like Florida.

As a group of conservative states enacted severe abortion restrictions last year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois sent letters to a handful of corporate executives with close ties to Texas. Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, urged executives to rethink basing their companies in “a state that strips its residents of their dignity.” Most workers, he wrote, did not want to live under a rigid abortion ban.

Oddly, European nations have suffered from such “severe” and “rigid” restrictions for years, without much notice from the Times, or any competition among EU to loosen abortion rules to attract young talent. As usual, liberals don't see unborn children as deserving of ""dignity.""

There was no immediate response to his overture. Companies thriving in Texas’ freewheeling business environment were not about to flee because of legally contested abortion regulations that were not certain to be enforced. Ten months later, the political and legal landscape is radically different. And a Supreme Court decision that abolished the right to an abortion is now threatening to reshape the lines of economic competition between conservative and liberal states.

It’s far too early to document that “threat,” but Burns was eagerly expecting the worst.

Burns characterized the pro-life position in hostile fashion.

For companies anchored in economically vibrant conservative states like Texas, Tennessee and Georgia, the rollback of women’s rights is no longer a hypothetical scenario but an immediate challenge…. That bargain may have grown more difficult in states that have imposed punitive abortion restrictions, banning the procedure altogether or limiting it nearly to the point of elimination.

Then he brought in Biden's Secretary of Commerce for reinforcement:

Big companies are fighting a “war for talent,” [Gina] Raimondo said, and particularly for female talent given that women make up a growing majority of new college graduates. A former governor of Rhode Island, Ms. Raimondo predicted that companies would find it difficult to recruit skilled workers in states where women’s rights and medical services were sharply curtailed.

Burns found some unrelated “data” that allegedly backed up that view.

There is data to back up that view: A survey published this month by the Pew Research Center found that more than 3 in 5 people with college and postgraduate degrees disapproved of the Supreme Court’s decision, along with nearly 70 percent of people under 30. Sixty-two percent of women disapproved of the decision, according to the survey.

Even Burns admitted the recent culture wars haven’t hurt red state economies. ""Yet even amid that drumbeat of controversy, a handful of big, conservative-leaning states like Texas, Florida and Georgia have defied predictions that anti-gay policies or laissez-faire gun laws would deter new investment.""",Q3

Tristan, a former design ethicist at Google whom you may remember from Netflix’s “The Social Dilemma,” joined Federalist Radio Hour on Thursday to discuss the urgent threats posed by social media.

We discussed everything from TikTok and national security to the metaverse to the psychology of social networks and their incentive structures. Our personal, professional, and political lives are now largely filtered through these poisonous platforms, the largest of which is owned by a company that operates out of a hostile foreign country.

We are in the midst of a tech crisis and a public health emergency. Tristan’s insights make that abundantly clear. It’s time for consumers, lawmakers, media, and business leaders to start recognizing that.

Tristan Harris Explains Why The Tech Crisis Is Much Worse Than We Realizehttps://t.co/ihuMSRgMYs — The Federalist (@FDRLST) August 18, 2022

Emily Jashinsky: We’re back with another edition of The Federalist Radio Hour. I’m Emily Jashinsky, culture editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at the Federalist dot com, follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today, I’m joined by Tristan Harris. He’s the co-founder and president of the Center for Humane Technology, which is catalyzing a comprehensive shift toward humane technology that operates for the common good.

He’s also the co-host of Your Undivided Attention, which consistently ranks among the top ten technology podcasts on Apple Podcasts and explores how social media’s race for attention is destabilizing society and the vital insights we need to envision solutions. Tristan, you probably remember from “The Social Dilemma”, which we talked about here, and we talk about the Center for Humane Tech, I cite it all the time here. So our listeners are certainly familiar with that. Formerly a design ethicist at Google. Tristan, thank you so much for joining Federalist Radio Hour.

Tristan Harris: My pleasure to be here, Emily.

EJ: So many, many, many people have seen The Social Dilemma. Just incredibly successful documentary that aired on Netflix and it covers your background pretty extensively. But for anybody who may have missed that, could you just brief us on your career and how you ended up at the Center for Humane Technology?

TH: Yeah, so I let’s see, I grew up in the Bay Area of California, and for the beginning of my life and career, I used to be very optimistic on technology. I actually thought I wanted to work at Apple and be part of the next Macintosh team. And actually since I was about 11 years old, I thought I wanted to do that.

So I was really early on what the positive and optimistic and inspiring cases that technology can really, you know, be in our lives. And I was really affected by, I think, the people and the culture that built the Macintosh. And so I knew I wanted to go into technology early on. I went to Stanford, got a degree in computer science and psychology not a degree in psychology, but kind of studied at the intersection of psychology, persuasion, sociology.

What influences human beings outside their awareness? I was a magician as a kid, and I took a class that was connected to this lab at Stanford called the Persuasive Technology Lab with Professor B.J. Fogg. And it was really the combination with the background with magic that I got interested in, how is technology restructuring our attention, our feelings, our thoughts, the choices that we make?

And that might sound like a conspiracy theory to many people, hopefully less so now, now that The Social Dilemma has kind of come out on Netflix and made that clear. But that was really where my attention went is how is technology shaping society, not just shaping in like a minor way, like rearranging on a restaurant menu, which item comes first which might affect your choices by like 2% or 5%, but really reshaping the entire basis of how 3 billion people make sense of the world. You know, so anyway, we can get into all that. But that’s kind of a bit of my background. And today we have let’s see, I could quickly summarize it to the best of my bio that might be relevant for folks.

I was a tech entrepreneur. I started a small company called Aperture. It was acquired by Google. I landed at Google and then became concerned about the issues of the attention economy in this race for attention and how I thought that was going to create perverse side effects starting in early on in 2012, 2013. And so I then became a design ethicist at Google studying how do you ethically be in the position of responsibility for 2 billion people’s attention starting with things like Gmail and notifications and then also going all the way up to structuring the competition of different social media platforms for our attention which would then lead to news and sense making in the way that newsfeeds rank things. So all of that then led us, led me to leave Google because I was not able to get anything done there and started this organization nonprofit called the Center for Human Technology, which is how we actuate the change in the world that we’re trying to see.

EJ: Google is such a good example because if I’m remembering correctly, in The Social Dilemma, you talk about Gmail, and Gmail is not Facebook, it’s not Twitter. It’s not Instagram or TikTok. It’s not something people often think about in terms of this context of the attention economy. It’s, you know, just the sort of blunt device that just delivers your mail in the same way that the USPS does.

But when you’re acting as a design ethicist at Google and you’re looking at Gmail, you’re basically trying to capture as much of any human being’s attention as you possibly can. Can you explain a little bit about the work of a design ethicist? And another question I have is how common those positions are in Silicon Valley, how they’ve changed or shifted or proliferated even over the last decade?

TH: Yeah, my other position name was head of the Ministry of Truth. No, I’m kidding. It’s funny actually watching that conversation go that direction, actually, because people think, OK, you know, Google is making there’s— this person called Tristan who’s thinking about the ethics of design choices, and they’re deciding what I’m going to get and what I’m going to see.

And that’s kind of alarming to people like who are they to choose how my life is structured or designed. But as you said, with Gmail, it’s more subtle, right? Because you think, Gmail, you think it looks like a neutral platform like I only get an email if someone sent me an email. But if you think about it, I mean, what drove me interested in into Gmail first?

I was addicted to email. I don’t know. Many of us, some people laughed at that in the film, actually. But, you know, you refresh your email, like 4 seconds later,I might pull to refresh again. I think it’s really important for listeners, just think about that. There’s a million behaviors we do on our smartphone every day that make no rational sense.

You’ll refresh to see how many likes you got or what new email you got, like a slot machine and then you do something else for about 30 seconds and you go right back to refreshing again. And notice that makes no rational sense. And I watch myself doing this, and I knew from the Persuasive Technology Class at Stanford in which we read a book called Don’t Shoot the Dog about clicker training for dogs, and also the way that Las Vegas slot machines work and I just noticed that this was what was going on for me, and I knew exactly how this worked.

I literally read the books on it. I studied with the people who built it, and I was addicted to my email. Now, an example like you’re saying, OK, so how does Gmail actually make design choices that affect what we see? Well, I’ll give you a real example. It was 20, I think it was 2013, And I was with the handful of people designing Gmail, which has a billion users at the time, and new cafe. I would go into anywhere around the world, have the laptops open, had Gmail open, right. Like it was where people live, not just an app to use. It’s a digital habitat. People do their work there and they leave it open all day.

And so, for example, if when a new email comes in, in your browser tab, it adds the parentheses, you know, the number goes four, five, six, ten, right? That’s attracting your attention. So whatever else you were doing, suddenly a design choice about should we update the title in the tab that says the number of unread emails that’s going to draw people’s attention there.

So even that which seems this like, well, that’s just a rational thing to do. Of course, I’m going to let the user know how many messages they have, but just that tiny design choice is causing people to switch tabs and basically not get anything done all day because they’re constantly distracted by checking the latest email. A concrete example of how Gmail at the time at the mobile app was trying to get more aggressive in this arms race for attention was they were competing with the regular email app on everyone’s phone and they needed to get you to switch from the regular email app into their custom Gmail app.

And so they, and I was in a meeting and an engineer said to me, like, Why don’t we make it buzz your phone every time you get an email because then you’ll never miss. We’ll turn email into text messaging basically. And that’s how we’ll outcompete the regular mail app. And you know, it seems like such an innocuous decision.

But there I was in that moment, he said that in my mind, visualized like these puppet strings going out into the sky, into the cloud and coming down and interrupting a billion dinner table conversations, you know, couples who are out on a date and, you know, or with, you know, with their families or something. And then their phone buzzes and it makes their attention just like 15% less.

They’re less available, less present for their family members. And so in a subtle way, even something as tiny as that would affect and restructure kind of these these billions of moments. But then, of course, that was way before we got to social media driving polarization, making us, you know, breaking down a shared reality, making democracies you know, dysfunctional.

We can get into more of that later, but I think that’s helpful context for your listeners.

EJ: Well, and it does highlight the irreconcilable, what feels like an irreconcilable tension between profit and consumer demand in that, you know, if you’re conditioning consumers to demand something very particular, you get into cigarette territory, you get into the territory of, you know, if you’re taking away or you’re eroding people’s free will intentionally, you want you’re profiting off of the question of ethics is is huge.

And, you know, this is something you think about all the time, obviously. But how does that is it possible to to reconcile that like is it possible to ethically design a cigarette? Is it possible? Great question. You know, or, you know, you can shift it. You say is it possible to ethically design Doritos? Well, probably. But, you know, it’s different degrees in different scales.

And we’ve seen Apple, for instance, you know, they tell you how much time you spent on your phone every week and TikTok, that’s a whole other can of worms, allows users now to track their time. Like we have seen some efforts in this direction. They don’t seem particularly meaningful to me.

And I’m curious, they’re not how to resolve those tensions if it’s possible.

TH: I love your question of can you design an ethical cigarette or can you design an ethical Ben and Jerry’s that isn’t just diabetes in a spoon? You know, I mean, it’s and many people say, well, that’s just what people want. We’re giving people what they want. But I think and so according to the logic of what people point their attention at is what they want.

If you use that logic. So if you put your attention on something, then I’m going to give you more of the thing you’re putting your attention on. We’re not making a distinction between what we want versus what we can’t help but look at. And I think this is really important because there’s a lot of things we can’t help but look at conflict, the most extreme version of what every political tribe is doing, you know, and also things that we’re traumatized by.

Like if you are a person who, if you’re Asian-American and you have had an experience of being, I don’t know, hate or belittled in the street or something, some kind of violence or something against you, that’s like a thing that you’re traumatized by. So you’re going to really look at it when it shows up in the news feed.

And then you click on one of those examples on, say, Twitter. And then Twitter’s like, oh, I’m going to show you a million more examples like that, because that’s the thing that worked for getting your attention. Now, meanwhile, you have a bunch of other people who are not clicking on that first example, and then they’re not getting reinforced with a thousand other examples of Asian-American hate.

So when they say there’s this thing that’s happening, it’s a really big deal and everybody is like I don’t see that happening. I mean, I’m, you know, a guy living in San Francisco, white. I don’t have that background. I’m not seeing any of those examples. So they sound kind of like they’re overreaching or crazy to me if I don’t see those same examples in my newsfeed.

So but that’s true for every side. Every side has a set of things that they’re seeing, like the you know, the pro CRT people, the anti people, the pro Black Lives Matter people, the anti-Black Lives Matter people. Everyone is seeing a different reality because you click on two videos and then it gives you infinite evidence that confirms what you already feel.

And so I’m not trying to say, well, there actually is this one absolute reality. That’s true. One of the problems of the modern world is like how big a problem is I don’t know, systemic racism. I mean, where do where do we where do we see that? How could you know, my eyeballs can’t see what 3 billion people are experiencing.

So how do I size up where that problem lives? And we’re only left to media that represents that to us. And so I’m not saying what is or isn’t true. I’m just, I want to really point people’s attention at the degree to which we’re missing each other. And there’s a great group called More in Common. We did actually a podcast episode with their director, Dan Vallone, on what they call perception gaps, which is can one political tribe estimate the beliefs of another political tribe?

So can Democrats accurately assess what they think Republicans believe as measured by what = percent of them say they believe that? And can Republicans accurately assess what Democrats believe? And what they found is that the more people use social media, the worse that they were at estimating what other people believe, meaning the bigger the gap between what they perceive the other side believing and what they actually believe.

And so I think that’s just a really important point, because no matter what you feel or believe or think is true or real, the important thing is that we have an exaggerated view of the gap between things the other side believes, the most extreme version instead of the reality.

EJ: And it’s interesting because I have a libertarian friend who will use the example of the wristwatch. He’ll say, you know, there is a tech panic. We wouldn’t think of it as tech. But at the time it was technology, the wristwatch. And people at the time were becoming sort of obsessed with looking at their wrist and checking the time.

And people were concerned about this. And there’s similar reports from the mirror. I mean, you can go back to basically any aspect of technology. Absolutely. There is some sort of moral panic about it. But what those technologies, with maybe the exception of the printing press didn’t do, was transfer vast swaths of our personal and professional lives to those devices or to the smartphone.

And the smartphone has the social media on it. And as somebody who’s been around for a huge part of the history, the young history of the sort of common tech or the modern tech industry, how much of this is smartphones? How much of this is social media and how much is the combination of both? Because there was AOL Instant Messenger that could be very addicting, but you had to go dial up and yeah, a desktop and you had to go to a special room in your house where the desktop was and dial up the Internet to get on air.

TH: I remember those days.

EJ: Right. The smartphone seems to play a big role in all of this as well.

TH: So I’m so glad you bring this up because let’s steelman instead of strawmanning the opposing view here. OK, so the opposing view is I saw The Social Dilemma. It sounds like a moral panic where we’ve always been worried about new technologies when they arrive on the scene, you know, television, radio, rock and roll. Elvis was shaking his hips.

Reefer madness, right. And there have been moral panics about all sorts of new technologies every time one new one arrives. So I want to name and acknowledge the full history of that phenomena of culture, having a moral panic about something new. I think the difference between, let’s say, a wristwatch and say social media. Now, take the example of how it’s affecting children if I’m like a 15 year old and I’m in high school and all my friends use Instagram, not just to post photos of their lives, which they do, but they also do their communication through Instagram.

Meaning I think a lot of adults who might be listening to your podcast might not get this, that teenagers actually might use Instagram as their primary way of messaging their friends. So there’s kind of been making plans like I can’t participate in my social life without using Instagram as a messaging app. But Instagram bundles the messaging with the infinite feed of We got an eye pointed at your brain stem to figure out and reverse engineer what’s going to resonate with your nervous system.

And that’s the next video, photo or thing we’re going to show you based on what was most engaging for you. And so a wristwatch that you put on your wrist didn’t control your social, whether you were excluded from your friends social group. Whereas social media and Instagram have controlled and taken over what it means to be participating in a society.

If I’m a politician, can I win an election without having an Instagram profile or a Facebook profile or a Twitter profile? Well, a few, maybe a while ago, you could do it, but now you can’t. Right. And the ones that do use these platforms are going to get an advantage. But the advantage that they get is in a bad game because they have to basically say the most extreme things that their follower base are going to respond to.

And so they’re not actually responding to their real constituents proportionately. They’re responding to the constituents that are resonating on social media. But social media has this amplification factor on the more you say an extreme thing about a cultural fault line, you add inflammation to that cultural fault line will pay you in more likes and followers that that’s the conversation with Elon, by the way, is you know, how do we fix Twitter?

It’s like it’s not just about speech versus censorship. That’s an important conversation. But the real problem with Twitter is it is a video game that I log into every day and I’m paid in more likes and followers. I get paid only ten points if I add information to a cultural fault line versus I get paid one point.

If I say, you know, here’s what I think the other side might be. Actually, I get paid negative points. If I say, here’s something I think the other side is thinking about that we should consider. We don’t get paid by acting in a good way. You get paid by being, you know, provocative. And people will say that’s no different than any other media.

But that has changed when you have an algorithm of Twitter that’s reinforcing things that you’ve already clicked on, and that’s different and unprecedented in the time of media. So hopefully that is true. Some of the concerns on this is a new and distinct issue no.

EJ: I mean, and this is one of the things that I found myself explaining to just slightly younger people, because the rate of change has gotten so quick that, you know, you can be a vastly different have vastly different life experience just by being a little bit younger. But anywhere you go with your phone, the difference between what you’re not looking at when you’re not looking at your phone, when you are looking at your phone could be the best news of your life. It could be the worst news of your life. And if you don’t look at your phone at that given moment, you might be missing it.

And that’s very different than even the beeper, than the telephone. There’s just no there’s nothing there’s no precedent for that in human history. And I guess I’m curious as to in your experience how aware these companies are. You know, Google might say, listen, we’re working on this. We’ve hired design ethicists. We have, you know, put a portion of our profits into ethical design.

TH: I need to answer that question because you asked that earlier, actually, about how does one get that job? Are there many design ethicists? Actually, I mean, but just to briefly clarify, there was no job for design ethicist at Google or Apple or Twitter or Facebook or anything like that. I didn’t apply for a job. I again, the people remember The Social Dilemma, which I recommend anybody who hasn’t seen watch The Social Dilemma.

I go through the history of my own trajectory, which is that I became concerned about this arms race for attention and then made up a slide deck basically that I sent to just 15 friends and colleagues at Google wanting to get feedback, saying, hey, I’m worried that this arms race for attention is going to value humans more when they’re addicted, distracted, outraged, polarized and misinformed and narcissistic and that that’s going to kind of break the way society works.

And then instead of it just being sent to those 15 people, they started sending it to other people. And within basically 48 hours it had spread to, you know, 40,000 people at Google. And then through the success of that presentation and some executives seeing it, I either was going to quit or I was going to be in this position where I can maybe research what do we do about this problem?

And to the generosity, maybe you could say of Google, they allowed me to research, how do you think about this question? How do you ethically design the environment in which applications compete for attention and news competes for attention? So I did that for a few years. But unfortunately, even though I tried very hard to change Android and Chrome and some of the core interfaces that could be changed, they would say, actually, if we do this, it will look paternalistic for Google to make these top down changes.

And it was clear to me that we needed to create a public awareness movement, and that’s why it came out on 60 Minutes. That’s when The Social Dilemma came out all that work coming out to the public was to create more public awareness that this is a massive problem and we have to do something about it.

EJ: You know, I’ve known people who have changed their phones to grayscale as I’m sure you have, and that might even be mentioned in Social Dilemma. But how aware are people when they are engineering these products, when they’re coming up with the new way for Facebook, for instance, they just announced they’re doing more of what TikTok does. And instead of circulating content from people already in your network, they’re going to be circulating and pushing more content from outside your network.

How aware are people in these positions down to the colors, down to all of this in terms of designing it to capture our attention, designing these things like slot machines? In terms of the psychology, how aware are people in those positions of kind of exactly what they’re doing on the granular detail level?

TH: It’s a great question. So first of all, I think there’s a lot of justification. If you work at Facebook or Twitter or TikTok today, you point to the thousand positive examples of things that happened today in the world because of what you were doing. So on Facebook, I point to blood donors who got to meet with other blood donors for rare diseases.

I see cancer support groups. I see the people who lost their horse. And then because of someone on Facebook tagged on, they found the horse. And I see the examples of, you know, Hollywood. I mean, high school sweethearts reconnecting because they found each other. So I can point to a list of a thousand amazing things that happened today because of the existence of social media.

And if I’m TikTok, I’d make a similar list about all the creative findings. I say, here’s all these these creators that now have an entire lifestyle and economic well-being. You know, they basically have a job where they can make money from just being creative and making videos. So I can point to all those examples of the goods.

Now you see a different question. Are they aware of the design choices that they make that are manipulative? I think this is a very interesting question. The people at the very top of the company, I think are aware like I forgot his name, the guy who runs TikTok, and also Zuckerberg, I think are both very aware because anybody who was there in the early days, the way that Facebook got successful was by manipulating human, social, psychological vulnerabilities.

The clear example of Facebook was photo tagging. I don’t know if you were in college when that, I was a sophomore at Stanford when that feature came out. The Facebook was like months old. And for those who don’t remember or know this history, they created the feature where you don’t just upload a photo of some stuff that’s in your life.

And, you know, this is back when you had to do on a desktop computer and do it manually from a digital camera.

EJ: You had to plug the camera in. Yeah.

TH: It’s funny. How that’s like history now, right? So but they added a feature called photo tagging so I could tag, you know, Tristan, and then in front of all of his friends, he would know that he was tagged in a photo by Emma, and then he’d say, Oh my God, Emma tagged me in the photo, I should, like, respond to that.

Or I have to, I have to make sure it’s a good photo. Otherwise I have to take it down and that was the best way to just get people getting sucked into Facebook for hours and hours a day. Because now all these photos are linked to people’s faces and names and you’re clicking through photos and you’re tapping into people’s vanity and sense of social validation.

And Zuckerberg and his team knew exactly what they were doing when they designed that feature. And they, you know, in different cases when they invented the like button, they thought they were spreading love and positivity in the world, but they also knew they were creating a feedback mechanism. And if you post something and instead of getting no feedback, you suddenly within minutes or seconds you would get ten likes or something like that, that that would be an addictive feature because you suddenly you have this reason to post and you know, you can get some dopamine and some oxytocin and serotonin from just dosing people with likes so they knew what they were doing when TikTok invented the, you know, the infinite scroll for, you know, for second video interface that you just infinitely go through, they know that if they remove the stopping cues, meaning they make it so that it automatically scrolls to the next video. They hide the clock, for example. They know exactly what they’re doing. Actually, a metaphor for listeners isin the casino.

Many of you may know that the designers of the casino actually hide clocks because they want you to lose track of time while you’re in the environment. They want you thinking about time. I didn’t realize it until recently, but if you’re using a TikTok on an iPhone that doesn’t have the notch at the top, but a flat top, TikTok will hide the clock on your phone because they don’t want you thinking about what time it is and how much time has passed since you’ve been scrolling.

These are deliberate design choices, and they do optimize down to the color, down to the, you know, the animations, down to the speed and time it takes for the new video to load. This is all optimized like a machine, and the results of which is that when we’re the product and not the customer, we are worth mor again, when we are addicted, distracted, outraged, narcissistic, validation, seeking and polarized than we are as healthy democratic citizens or as growing children. Right?

These people who are designing streaks on Snapchat, which show the number of days in a row that kids have sent a message to their friend, which they did just to addict people. Because now if you if you’ve been sending a message to your best friend for 30 days, in a row, now if there’s 30, there’s a number 30 and a fireball next to your name, I don’t want that number 30 to go away just like that I’ve been working at the gym for ten days in a row. It makes it harder to not go the next day, but they’re using that not to help me go to the gym more often, which I might independently choose. They’re using that to support their goal of driving you to keep engaging. And that’s the problem.

EJ: I had a 700 day snap streak once.

TH: Wow. OK, so tell me then, so you have it for share. I mean, I might sound like I’m spinning a conspiracy theory, but it was probably pretty hard to to let go of that 700 day streak, right?

EJ: It was accidental. Yeah, it was. it was really a traumatic moment when the streak went away because my friend that I had it with was in a different time zone. And we just we lost track and it got messed up. But I’m curious what the R&D looks like in that space. Like, is this informed by scientists? Is it AB tested? Is it focus grouped? I mean, how do they optimize these platforms to function in that machine-like way, they’re optimized for this addiction and for keeping you engaged?

TH: The word is engagement. That’s the word everybody should know is what is engagement. It means seven day actives, meaning users who have been active in the last seven days. That number should go up. The number of sessions that you’ve engaged with per day that should go up, the number of amount of minutes per procession should go up.

The number of total users should go up. The number of users who invite other users should go up. That’s all engagement that was captured in The Social Dilemma where you had the artificial intelligence robot guy sitting behind the control screen that’s basically in a control room that’s trying to increase, you know, time spent advertising per minute spent and then also how many users you invite because all those drive up engagement.

So at this point and even back then, it was pretty well known how to manipulate people’s social psychology. And again, I mentioned, you know, there is a field called Persuasive Technology, which I want to make sure I’m very clear. B.J Fogg, the professor who created this field and wrote the book on Persuasive Technology, who I studied with. He wanted he warned the FTC and I think the late nineties about the ethics of persuasive technology and the need to regulate the space because it’s going to turn into a huge problem.

And he’s not the evil guy with the mustache, you know, twisting it to say, how can I ruin the world? He really was trying to actually use persuasive technology for good. He actually created a whole initiative. How do you use persuasive technology to create more peace in the world. So he did a lot of things there, but there’s a whole space in which once you show people, once there’s this increasing encyclopedia of techniques of how to manipulate people.

And again, I was a magician as a kid, so I knew that there’s a hundred techniques to manipulate people, sense of cause and effect attention, their reasoning, their memory of what happened. There’s a thousand techniques and most people don’t want to admit this is true, but it is totally true. It’s just built into how our minds work. And behavioral economics kind of reinforced that.

And there’s a bunch of conferences in Silicon Valley, in books. There’s a guy named Ariel who had a conference called Hooked, and I spoke at it once. And I remember distinctly he had the head of growth at Pinterest. They’re giving a talk and he said, Now, what would happen if a user gets burnt out and they stopped using the service like a drug lord?

It’s like you stopped using what do they do then? What? He said, Oh, that’s no problem. You just do the following ten techniques and it gets them using it right again, right back. And that’s what people should know is that there is an entire discipline to about how to kind of influence people psychology and it wasn’t done because they wanted to wreck the world.

It’s they wanted to be successful for their business. But the underlying terrain, on top of which that success would be built, was by degrading the soil out of which our society grows. Right? It’s like you’re telling the soil for, you know, for children’s development, how their minds work and you instead of saying, how do we cultivate that soil?

So it grows the best children and, you know, you know, maturity and, you know, healthy development in the world, they’re just saying, how do we keep kids addicted to Snapchat? How do we keep kids addicted to TikTok? And it works really, really well. And I recommend for any parents out there, you have to note, this is not built for the health of your kids and simply limiting the time that they spend is like saying, well, I’ll just limit the amount of heroin that I get every day to like a few milligrams.

So let’s just not give the kids heroin and let’s remove their social communication from an environment which is dominated by that kind of heroin. Like how do we get communication out of that space? There’s a great organization called Fairplay that used to be called the Campaign for Commercial Free Childhood that has been working on that for a long time.

And we’re all allies trying to liberate essentially humidity from the shackles of this manipulative environment.

EJ: Yeah, and you know, it’s your personal lives and your politics. It’s everything that’s in the heroin is informing every conversation that we have. And Social Dilemma came out. I think it was like right on the cusp of TikTok becoming really big. I know you’ve been doing some work in the national security space, too, which is a huge conversation, obviously, when it comes to TikTok which, is now, I think the number one website in America. What stands out to you? You just sort of talked about it a little bit, but what about TikTok stands out to you and in this context of the attention economy?

TH: OK, I’m so glad you asked this question. And I think it’s just the most critical thing. And also from a national security perspective, if I could get the U.S. national security community to ban TikTok right now, I would. And we’ll get into that. Let’s quickly talk about how to TikTok, as you mentioned recently, overtook YouTube and Facebook and Instagram and I think engagement time.

I can’t remember which place it might be globally. Or in certain markets, but they have basically eaten the lunch of all the other social media companies. In fact, I actually I was at a events theater a couple of months ago and a woman came up to me. She said, oh, I saw The Social Dilemma. Thank you so much, I stopped using all social media. Now I just use Ti​​kTok. And I was really sad by that. Because the real message of the film is not You should be angry at one or two of these apps. It’s the race to the bottom of the brain stem to get attention that thing is going to hurt human humanity and TikTok, the way to beat Facebook and YouTube in the attention wars and the race to the bottom of the brain stem is they optimized for one thing, which is you’re watching a video and I’m going to point the biggest supercomputer in the world sitting in Beijing at your brain stem and your kid’s brain stem and at your uncle who you know, and I’m going to calculate the perfect next video to show that and it will know you better than you know yourself. It will know what will keep you there better than your prefrontal cortex or the part of your brain that basically has your willpower and says, oh, I have to do something else. It will calculate how to defeat your prefrontal cortex.

People should be very concerned because the Chinese Communist Party has influence over ByteDance, which is the company that owns TikTok.

TikTok has basically become the number one social media app around the world. Would you have allowed the Soviet Union during the Cold War to basically control television programing for all Western democracies and pick what they see and they don’t see? I mean, it is absolutely insane that we’ve allowed this to happen.

And by the way, for those who think that I’m being, you know, a conspiracy theorist, or xenophobic, China does not allow any U.S. social media platforms in their country. So they don’t have Facebook or Twitter because they think the U.S. would be running an influence operation on their citizens. Why? Given the fact that that’s their worldview, would we assume anything less than they would intend to use this platform for psychological?

And for most people, they think about TikTok. They’ve heard in the news about the U.S. government’s concerns about data and that they’re going to, TikTok will basically siphon up all this data on Americans. That’s true. But I’m even more worried about them being able to remotely influence basically the next president, the United States. They can say, yeah, we want it to be this person.

They can look at all the voting districts in the swing states and they can say per zip code. I mean, I don’t need Frank Luntz, the political pollster, because I can basically look at people’s sentiments with an AI that calculates what people’s opinions are in all the key voting areas. And then I can strategically up regulate everybody who starts to say, you know, China’s really not so bad.

We should look more what they’re doing. If China were to invade Taiwan tomorrow, they could up regulate all the American voices who are saying that Taiwan was always a part of China. And I was actually talking to a U.S. senator who said, who do you think the Chinese government considers the biggest rival to its power? And of course, you would think it’s like the United States but they said, no, no, no.

They consider their own technology companies to be the biggest rival to the CCP. And for those who don’t know, China actually massively regulates its own technology company. So if you use TikTok in China, when you scroll, you don’t get influencer videos. They actually feature science experiments you can do at home, educational content, patriotism videos. They have closing hours and opening hours.

It actually goes lights out at 10 p.m. They limit you to 40 minutes a day because they want their kids to be scientists, astronauts and engineers, and they want their military to be successful in the future. And where they’re happy to ship the version of TikTok, that’s essentially opium for the masses to the entire West and I think it’s like a reversal of those, you know, history. You know, what they call the great humiliation, which is when their society fell behind because of opium. This is kind of a reversal of that and I don’t think it’s because of one diabolical plan. I think that there’s this Chinese company that was just super successful at playing this game called The Race to the Bottom of the Brainstem.

And now the West has to respond.

EJ: Unbelievable. And I guess there was a Sarah Fisher report in Axios just yesterday about how Oracle is now auditing TikTok data and that was both on two fronts. It was on the front of privacy, and it’s on the front of algorithmic control. And, you know, it’s sort of like, look at Oracle’s doing this and they’re going to, you know, disincentivize any sort of nefarious behavior on behalf of the CCP in the United States.

But it’s also incredibly hard to trust that process. So just on what do you think about is that a solution going forward of TikTok, is that something that’s really a meaningful step in a better direction?

TH: Well, I think on the Oracle side, that’s about data. So where is the data going? Where is it getting stored? Who has access to it? Oracle could provide some slightly more trust in that area, but how would we know that TikTok is not manipulating which content people are seeing in all the swing states? TikTok, for example, does not release to researchers a what’s called an API or something where you can researchers can basically look at the full firehose of all the videos. Twitter, for example, does offer that firehose or researchers can actually, you know, do computation and analytics and math on what is actually moving through through Twitter and what is getting amplified, what, you know, what are the networks of, you know, where teams are traveling TikTok doesn’t offer that.

So they could and they’ve already done this, by the way, there’s been research by the Tech Observatory at UC Berkeley that has been studying, especially how TikTok was influenced during this war in Ukraine, where because Russia passed what they call the, quote, fake news law in which basically if you said it’s at the beginning of the war, all the videos that were posted on TikTok, most of them from around the world were against Putin. And after Russia passed the fake news law, because they have a lot of citizens who use a TikTok. I was told just today, this morning that Russia is the fifth biggest market for TikTok in the world. So, you know, this is a big market but because they’re allied, TikTok basically no longer pushes any pro-Ukraine content and anti Russia content. And all the videos that you see are, you know, why Putin’s great and why the war is justified and everything else. And again, that’s slightly more visible. But they never announced that they were making that change.

So TikTok can we actually know that they have the controls to flip a switch. And in certain countries, they can basically make people feel one way or the other and they can do that per country.

If I was China and the CCP, I would take TikTok and remotely influence, you know, all of Africa. So along with my debt traps that I’ve laid for all the African nations and building airports and then putting them in debt to have influence over them in the future. I would also use TikTok to make people think in Africa that, hey, look, this is Putin just actually fighting back against Nato.

This is totally justified and I could basically control and gerrymander the future votes of other countries and my soft power to coordinate how the world works. So we’re going all the way from email addiction and pulling to refresh in the slot machine all the way up to a geopolitical power game. But I really, really want people to get just how critical this is.

And I think it’s something that everyone can be aligned on, it’s not a partisan issue.

EJ: No, it’s not at all. And you’ve been having these conversations increasingly, I know, with people in politics, with people in business. And, you know, you just mentioned having this conversation with a U.S. senator. Are you finding that some of this is like completely unchartered territory to the point where people don’t, haven’t this put two and two together because it’s happening so quickly?

And it’s so new that when you do explain it to them, they get the gravity of it or is it still just sort of hazy?

EJ: So the meta problem, as it were in media, I don’t mean Facebook Meta, I mean the Meta of the problem, but that’s about the problems. We go back to E.O. Wilson to answer your question, which is that the fundamental problem of humanity is we have Paleolithic brains and emotions, medieval institutions and God like accelerating technology. And it’s so important to come back to that because you know, it is always the case that technology moves faster than institutions.

You know, we get cars before we get seatbelts in traffic lights, we get railroads before we get the regulation of railroads, we get dynamite before we realize, hey, we should actually not sell dynamite in every, you know, CVS down the corner, which, by the way, you used to be able to get. So we don’t usually realize that we’ve created a God like technology until afterwards.

And it needs some kind of guardrails. And guardrails is what we’re looking for here, not free speech, ministry of truth. We’re looking for. How do we set up the incentives in some safe ways for this to work? But I think the problem to answer your question, talking to U.S. senators or national security leaders, you’re sort of saying, hey, do they do they put two and two together?

I think slowly some are. But you have to paint the whole picture. Because if I’m a general that went to West Point and trained in all this military theory and, you know, I know about, you know, the position of all the U.S. Navy and, you know, where the nukes are. And I know how to think about the power calculus.

And I worked at the office of net assessment at the Pentagon or all that stuff. Why would I know what my 14 year old daughter is doing on TikTok or that China might be just influencing certain zip codes? Like how would that reach my dashboard? And there’s all sorts of cases, even after 9-11, where there’s an institutional gap where we have some institutions, we have a Space Force and we have a Navy and we have an Air Force, we don’t have a Metaverse force.

We don’t have a social media defense force. And I do think that population centric psychological warfare is the new is one of the new modes of warfare along with cyber warfare. I don’t have to actually have F-35 to match you in kinetic military capacity if I can actually do a cyber attack and, you know, hack the Colonial Pipeline, which later was released, apparently that the Colonial Pipeline was two days away from basically having major cascading effects that could have shut down the U.S. economy if it’s just been two days longer than it was and a cyber weapon cost a lot less than an F-35 and a social media weapon that makes your population angry at each other so that all the energy goes into …because everyone’s just fighting with each other all the time. And meanwhile, I’m just playing chess and beating you by routing around all your decisions. That’s the thing I want to shake people out of. It’s like the US has to reboot its society a bit into a 21st century society that also has a positive view of how tech can be embraced.

I think the last thing is, you know, China is consciously employing the full suite of 21st Century technologies from big data to A.I. surveillance to quantum computing and to make a stronger form of authoritarian society, a society that we wouldn’t want in with Western values, but they’re consciously employing tech plus authoritarianism equals stronger, better authoritarianism. Meanwhile, democracies are not consciously employing the full suite of tech to make stronger democracies.

Instead, we have allowed private tech companies to profit from degrading democracies into not working as well as they need to. So we can’t just be satisfied with slightly less toxic social media. I want to move to a world where tech plus democracy equals stronger democracy that has an embrace of tech, not an opposition to tech. And that’s a nuance people might not expect from me because they think Social Dilemma is kind of a Luddite film or something.

EJ: Well, the Gmail example that you gave earlier is really sticking with me because speaking of Meta, when you described looking around a cafe and seeing how more than half of the people were on Gmail and people keep it open all day and in some sense it is this very physical workspace. It’s become over, especially after the pandemic and going forward even more so. And I have an Oculus and I see the programs that they have for people to work virtually, to work in the metaverse. And they’re kind of crude right now. But we know that one of the most powerful companies in the world, Meta, is investing really heavily on making those spaces, well, addictive in the same way that Gmail was being made addictive.

But despite the fact that this was on everybody’s laptops at the cafe, that company didn’t have a team working on the ethics of it, period. Even though it was consuming so much time, so much of the world’s time, and being controlled by a fairly, you know, small team compared to the rest of the world. And in Northern California, so I’m wondering what you think is at stake in the metaverse.

I remember Sheryl Sandberg in the pandemic basically bragging about talking to faith leaders, about getting their churches into the metaverse. And that might sound great in the same way that a lot of other steps in tech sounded really great. But what ends up happening is you have control of your worship spaces, you have control of your political spaces, in the hands of one company.

So what worries you? Or maybe what gives you optimism about the metaverse going forward?

TH: Well, I think we’ve already seen how positively framed mission statements like we’re going to connect the whole world together and we’re going to bring the world closer together, which was the new mission statement for Facebook or, you know, we’re going to host the, you know, the public square for Twitter. Each of those positive mission statements and narratives were not what the underlying machines that they built were designed to optimize for.

Like Facebook was not designed to make the world more open and connected. It was designed for engagement. What can I show you? What can I get you invited to? What can I tag you with that keeps you coming back to this system over and over again? That’s what they’re designing for. And there’s a gap between the mission statement and what the machine is optimized for.

Same thing with Twitter. It is also a place where people can publicly post their thoughts to the whole world. But the actual machine, like if you talked to the engineers, how are they incentivized? What are they literally performance bonuses? So if I’m an employee at Twitter and I work on the newsfeed, how do I, like make a bonus?

Well, I showed that engagement went up by 10% while I was working on this feature. And that’s what gets me my bonus next year. And so long as that’s how the incentives are structured, we’re going to see those results. So when you ask about VR and the metaverse, we’re going to hear the same thing. We’re going to hear the positive narrative story. We can be able to connect the world and connect church groups together, and people are going to spend time together.

There’s all those things could happen, and many of them will be positive. But that’s not the machine that they have built. The 10,000 engineers that they want to hire to build VR in the metaverse are not going to be asked to say, how do we, you know, liberate the best of humanity, they’re going to be tasked with how do we make our VR platform the most engaging and addictive it can be, especially so long as it outcompete the other VR platforms.

So it’s another race to the bottom of the brainstem. Now to leave people with some hope, you know, in the social media world before we get to VR. But in the regular, today’s world, Apple is one of the interesting actors that I think needs to have far more pressure put upon them because they often get away with they’re definitely not one of the bad guys, and that makes them a good guy because they’re not a social media company and they don’t optimize for engagement.

And their business model is selling you a new phone every two years. And I also want to applaud the things that they have done, the privacy tracking features that they’ve done, the screen time features, the Do Not Disturb features. You know, these are all in the direction of more humane technology. And when Tim Cook announced, by the way, that they were doing these privacy tracking features, he said out loud, We cannot allow a social dilemma to become a social catastrophe.

So they’re on board. But Apple could do so much more to change, if you will, almost like the digital Constitution for how all apps can and cannot behave. So if we want a Geneva Convention in this arms race for attention, Apple could implement it because all the apps have to live in their app store and you know, people would say, well, Apple, that has too much power.

We shouldn’t have a private entity like they have too much, which is exactly true. We shouldn’t have. You know, which is the point you were also making, is the VR world going to get owned by $1 trillion, you know, $2 trillion tech companies? That’s not a good environment. We need to be in the democratic interest. So we have to figure out some different governing structure but I do think that short term, if you wanted to change all the perverse stuff that we’ve laid out in the last hour, I think that Apple could a year from now, within less than a year from now, ship on the next iPhone, a different set of rules that says you can’t do auto playing videos for underage kids and then no end. A lot of playing videos for underage kids and suddenly you’ve solved the TikTok problem. And they’re already making changes that are in this direction. We just need to demand so much more.

EJ: Yeah. I mean, it’s amazing. That’s kind of my next question, I was going to ask you about the Farhad Manjoo column “I was wrong about Facebook” in that long series of mea culpas that The New York Times tasked its editorial staff to do.

TH: To be honest, I actually haven’t seen those. Could you say more about them?

EJ: Yeah, no, absolutely. So they all had this challenge where they issued a mea culpa, something they were wrong about. So some of them were, you know, very political, some of them were more cultural. And Farhad’s was “I was wrong about Facebook.” And he wrote “The site has crossed a threshold. It is now so widely trafficked that it’s fast becoming a routine aid to social interaction like email and antiperspirant.”

And it’s a sort of a clever way of putting it, but a very true one. And the big question here is whether there’s a way really to put the toothpaste back in the tube. There are some even bigger questions about what it means that people on one side of the world I mean, I think about TV. Walter Cronkite broadcasting from Vietnam.

Betty White was on an experimental broadcast of TV, and she passed away in the age of TikTok. The stuff is just moving so quickly and connecting people from different cultures so quickly that in ways that were never envisioned and were not clearly keeping up with the rate of change. So is there a way to sort of put the toothpaste back in the tube and have a healthier economy or is it sort of, it should we be more defeatist and practice some sort of Benedict option to just get out while we can?

TH: Yeah, well, I think it’s important to note and again, I don’t want to say let’s copy China, but notice it’s almost like they saw The Social Dilemma and they enacted a whole horizontal, you know, slate of reforms right there. They don’t let 14 year olds, they limit you know time they do opening hours and closing hours so that no one has to use it at ten after 10 p.m. because there’s no social pressure that that your friends are not continuing to tag you and stuff at 11 p.m. and midnight and one in the morning now you’re not getting sleep like they’re enacting a whole suite of reforms.

I think that tech plus democracy can equal stronger democracy. I think the question is, what is adequate to accomplish that goal? Is just privacy legislation that limits the amount of data that they can collect going to get us to a world where the actual personalized engagement driven news feeds and on playing videos for 3 seconds are not going to continue to ruin your kids attention and mental health? Privacy doesn’t get you all the way there if you have antitrust and you just break them up into, you know, from two or three companies that are pursuing engagement, too. Now you have 100 companies that are even more aggressive in the race to the bottom of the brainstem. That also doesn’t get you to a world where they’re not racing for that engagement.

So we have to change the underlying North Star from engagement to something that actually has some public interests at heart. But you can’t be affecting children without caring about children and families getting better throws the technology not worse. If you know, tech plus attention has people better attention. Tech plus family should equal stronger families. Tech plus kids should equal better, healthier, better educated kids.

Now, that might sound uncomfortable, some people, but when you realize just how central it is, it’s like roads plus cities should equal, you know, better transportation for the whole city. Like the city should be humming along as a better, healthier you know, more functioning city with higher bandwidth and more throughput. And what we need is for social media to be like that.

But for the way our society works at a more comprehensive level, and I do think, like I said, that you’re kind of asking people to put the toothpaste back in the bottle. You know, we might need to kill a few cancer cells, like there’s some bad cancer cells out there. And I want a name that if a cancer cell has a social responsibility council or an advisory board or something like that, like it’s still a cancer cell, you know, if a cancer cell has a a research department to sort of give transparency reports about how how it’s affecting various organs, it’s still a cancer cell while it’s giving you that transparency we have to change the DNA of Facebook, Twitter, TikTok from the cancer cells that they are for our society into something that’s actually healthy.

Now, we can either do that through regulation and actually forcing and deepening a change that has to comprehensively hit the way the employees and the incentives are structured. Or we also probably need some better newer platforms that are more optimized from the ground up to strengthen the way society works.

I know that might sound bold and aggressive, but I also think that’s the size of the kind of 21st Century digital democracy we should be living in too, which is the only way we’re going to compete with China anyway.

EJ: No, absolutely. I mean, on the right, people come all the time pitching their new social networks. I remember talking to the CEO of Parler a couple of years ago and saying, Well, speech stuff, great. What are you going to do differently than Twitter in terms of addictiveness? Because if you can’t answer that question I’m not interested in this product as a solution to the problems.

So let’s end on that. Tristan, is there reason for optimism? Is the mood in Silicon Valley one of innovation right now? Are people trying to come up with these ideas and these products, or is there still a brick wall? Or is it maybe a combination of all of those things?

TH: So I think I’ve been working on this for close to ten years now. And so there’s been a lot of patience and I want to, I’m sure a lot of people might be feeling pretty daunted by what we’ve kind of laid out, if it is so comprehensively, you know, toxic to many of the core support structures of the way our society works.

And I’m sure that they’re like, it’s a hard thing to look at every day. But back in 2013, if you told me that Facebook stock price would be cut in half, which it recently was through the Apple privacy changes that happened that the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, would be saying we can’t allow a social dilemma to become a social catastrophe, that the attorney generals, just like they did for Big Tobacco, created a lawsuit that increased the costs that changed the business of tobacco from being a social norm to now being a defunct industry.

They did the same thing. We have an energy lawsuit for a consumer harms to kids that is now emerging. We have employees coming out and whistleblowers coming out, giving transparency to some of the externalities that have been hidden for a long time. We have, you know, Apple making changes in the right positive direction. We have culture and regulators starting to catch on.

We had the EU, at least, that’s passing the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act. So we’re seeing way more movement than we’ve ever seen in the ten years that at least I’ve been working on this. And I want people to feel the momentum because it is picking up and picking up speed do I think that Facebook or Twitter or TikTok have taken in this critique and said, you know what, you’re right, we have to totally transform everything we’re doing now and I also don’t expect them to.

There’s a great line by Upton Sinclair, the American author. “You cannot get someone to question something that their salary depends on them not seeing,” and I think that Zuckerberg has built his identity, and just like the guy from TikTok and just like any of the companies you built your identity and your wealth around the success of something that does do some benefit in the world.

But the optimization for engagement produces externalities and costs that live on the balance sheet of society, that break that society. And we can no longer afford those things. So whether they recognize it or not, I don’t want to wait for their consciousness to emerge. I want to make sure we get there through all the means possible through national security, through litigation, through employees coming out through Apple, making the relevant changes and creating the Geneva Convention.

There’s ways that this could change within a year from now in a pretty dramatic way. But we would need all those sectors acting at the level that we need to. We would need national security saying, hey, this is going to be a tier one priority in the national security strategy.

You know, you could have these kinds of changes happen really quickly, but we need a focused effort from all these sectors acting a once.

EJ: Move fast and put things back together. Maybe that’s the new motto going forward.

TH: You said it, not me.

EJ: Well, Tristan, thank you so much for your time and your insights and all of the work that you do in this space. I think it is some of the most important work in American politics and culture and honestly in the world right now. So thank you for joining Federalist Radio Hour.

TH: So good to be with you. I really hope everyone takes this to heart and wherever you are listening to this, like in ways that you can contribute to this whole system moving, please do. Because I think a lot of people look at that and say somehow, you know, it’s going to change on its own. And we just do need everybody talking about it and making it a central issue.

We found even talking to the national security community, it was through their children who were affected by it, who saw Social Dilemma, who recommended it to their parents, who are in, you know, top positions that led to some of the change. So change can happen from a lot of places. Just keep that in mind.

EJ: Yeah, I’ve heard that, too, actually. I’ve heard similar stories about Social Dilemma’s impact on people. And, you know, on an optimistic note, Sinclair, who you just cited, was also reacting to tech and tech that we have discovered better ways to deal with and all of the years since then. And parents, by the way, should go to the Center for Humane Technologies website and look at their Ledger of Harms.

If there are any members of Congress listening, their staff go to the Ledger of Harms. It’s incredibly useful. You and your team do a great job with that, Tristan.

TH: Thank you so much. Yeah, we try to put out as many resources we can. We also have a Foundations of Humane Technology course for technologists, and we have people from Apple, Facebook, you know, Google, the United Nations, all sorts of places that are taking it. That’s also to try to train technologies in a different way to think about these problems.

And that’s also helpful for regulators and other folks working on these issues. So we’re all doing the best we can.

EJ: Yeah so if folks are interested they can check out the Center for Humane Technology and listen to Your Undivided Attention podcast that Tristan is the co-host of.

https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2022/08/18/yeah-trumps-dr-oz-endorsement-probably-cost-us-the-senate-n1622086,"Yeah, Trump's Dr. Oz Endorsement Probably Cost Us the Senate","Dr. Mehmet Oz, who earned former President Donald Trump’s primary-race endorsement in April, is going down in flames according to a new GOP poll.

Republican-affiliated Public Opinion Strategies reports that surgeon-turned-TV-host Dr. Oz trails Democrat John Fetterman by nearly 20 points.

Advertisement

Trump gave Oz his “complete and total endorsement” before the wide-open GOP primary of six candidates, a move that probably sealed the deal with Pennsylvania Republicans.

The doc won in a squeaker, barely beating out second-place finisher David McCormick, 31.2% to 31.1%.

The former president praised Oz’s positions on abortion, crime, the Second Amendment, border security, the military, education, energy independence, and election fraud. Those are all well and good, but before lending an endorsement, someone in Trump’s position first needs to determine whether the recipient is at all likely to win the general election.

In Dr. Oz’s case, right now that’s a big, fat NO.

Let’s face it: He is not a good candidate.

After winning his primary, Oz went AWOL.

While Fetterman was literally incapacitated by a stroke, the doc failed to capitalize on a prime opportunity to define himself and his prone opponent:

Recent reporting suggests that Oz might not have taken advantage of those several weeks where Fetterman was sidelined, a significant span of time during a race that could be integral to party control of the Senate. Puck is reporting that the former TV personality was in Palm Beach, Florida, until June 9 at least, not holding his first post-primary event until June 10. Oz reportedly also traveled to Ireland to visit family at the end of June and did not return until early July.

If anything, I’m reminded of the Summer of ’88, when Democratic presidential nominee Mike Dukakis took time off from the campaign — time that GOP candidate George H.W. Bush took full advantage of to define Dukakis as too liberal and soft on crime.

Recommended: I’m Just Going to Go Ahead and Say It: Twitter Is Objectively Pro-Groomer

This summer, Trump himself is reportedly frustrated with the former Oprah regular’s barely-there campaign:

Sources tell Puck that Donald Trump, who enraged some of his base by supporting Oz, is now complaining to his Fox News bud Sean Hannity about his poor performance. Hannity was the one who coaxed Trump to endorse him in the first place, and throw in the fact that Hannity hasn’t had Trump on his show since April, he must be hopping mad.

You should take all “sources tell” reports with a grain of salt, but Oz is in such bad shape that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has canceled $5 million worth of TV advertising and will divert it to more winnable races.

When Oz does try to connect with Pennsylvania voters, it doesn’t always work.

The clip has been mocked as Oz’s “I mean it’s one banana, Michael, what could it cost, 10 dollars?” moment.

Oz himself admits that he was “exhausted” when he made the video.

Fetterman raked in half a million dollars in campaign donations in the 24 hours after that video was released.

The spike in donations between Monday and Tuesday afternoon was “well above” the campaign’s average rate, Fetterman’s communications director, Joe Calvello, told CNBC on Wednesday.

Even if Oz does win, you get the feeling that the conservative-come-lately might be another Mitt Romney, but lacking the warm, common touch that’s made Mitt a favorite on both sides of the aisle.

(Take a moment to wipe the excess sarcasm off your screen.)

Exclusively for our VIPs: Putin Wants a Fleet of Aircraft Carriers and Has Also Maybe Eaten Shrooms

Maybe I’m wrong.

Maybe the GOP’s Pennsylvania field was so weak that Trump really did endorse the best candidate — even if he isn’t very good.

Maybe Dr. Oz will warm up on the campaign trail and deliver a win. His campaign positions, particularly on energy, are much closer to the typical Pennsylvanian’s than Fetterman’s.

Maybe the GOP’s path to a Senate majority doesn’t run through the Keystone State.

Maybe Pennsylvania, even with a stronger Republican candidate, isn’t winnable.

Maybe the Senate is just not the GOP’s for the taking this year. Like my friend and colleague Stephen Kruiser, I had very little hope of the Republicans winning the Senate this year — right up until the Biden DOJ’s ham-fisted Mar-a-Lago raid.

But Trump himself won Pennsylvania convincingly in 2016, and we’ll probably never know the full extent of 2020’s election-night shenanigans there. So I can’t help but think that with a stronger candidate, the GOP could pick off Pennsylvania’s open seat.

Then there are two of Trump’s other Senate endorsements — J.D. Vance in Ohio and Hershel Walker in Georgia. Both of those races ought to be near shoo-ins, but both Trump-endorsed candidates are struggling.

I don’t know what’s gone wrong with The Donald’s endorsement radar, but it seems to be giving false returns.",Q3

Under the new guidance released on Tuesday, which was reviewed by the New York Post, officers and supervisors cannot 'congregate, or engage in unnecessary conversation with other members of the service while on the post, absent police necessity.'

Another section of the memo tells patrol supervisors to 'Ensure members of the service do not congregate, or engage in unnecessary conversation with other members of the service while on post, absent police necessity.'

The memo comes just over two weeks after a video posted online showed the mayor stopping to talk to a patrol supervisor while on a Summer Streets bike ride.

In the video, posted on Twitter August 6, Adams points to two officers standing on a street corner and tells their supervisors 'they should not all be congregating together.

'How about scattering out, so we can ensure safety and deploy personnel?' Adams suggests, noting: 'We have not been deploying our personnel correctly.'

In a statement to the Post, a spokesman for the mayor said he has 'repeatedly said in the past, he supports the NYPD and will work every day to ensure they have the resources to do their jobs.

'This is a tactical problem that could possibly pose a risk to both officers and to members of the public,' the spokesman continued. 'This is exactly why the mayor and the police commissioner have had several conversations about this issue, and they both agree that we can more effectively deploy our officers.'

Video posted online earlier this month showed New York City Mayor Eric Adams, second from left, admonishing patrol sergeants because officers were standing around talking

The mayor points to officers standing on a street corner and tells their supervisors 'they should not all be congregating together' in the video

But after the new guidance was issued, members of the police union quipped that there soon won't be enough officers to deploy because so many are quitting.

'The order is unnecessary,' Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch told the Post.

'Pretty soon there won't be enough cops left to congregate anywhere in the city, because these miserable working conditions and the low pay are forcing them to quit in droves.'

A Manhattan officer with more than two decades on the job also said the mayor has other issues he should concentrate on.

'Worry about crime in the city, and stop worrying about cops congregating,' the unnamed officer said.

'Worry about your transit system and how it's out of control. Worry about your shootings. Officers can't even walk around their own neighborhood without getting their a** kicked.'

And Joseph Giacalone, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor and a former NYPD sergeant, said the fact that the department is issuing the guidance shows how it is suffering from staffing issues.

'They don't have enough people,' he said. ' You can't cover all these events and move cops to hot spots. After a while, you say to yourself, ""Who's left?""'

Pension fund statistics obtained by the New York Post suggest 2,465 officers have filed their notices so far this year, 42 per cent more than the 1,731 who had done so over the same period in 2021

A whopping 1,098 cops who turned in their badges did so before reaching a full pension, to which they are entitled after 20 years of service

Pension fund statistics obtained by the New York Post suggest 2,465 officers have filed their notices to quit so far this year, 42 percent more than the 1,731 who had done so over the same period in 2021.

Meanwhile, a whopping 1,098 cops who turned in their badges did so before reaching a full pension, to which they are entitled after 20 years of service.

The number of 'early' retirees for the same period of 2021 was just 641.

In response to these statistics, Lynch called on officials to 'admit' to the problems the department is facing.

'This exodus is the result of cops in the prime of their careers deciding they have had enough. They are leaving for other opportunities where they're paid better, treated better and have a better quality of life,' he said in comments tweeted by the benevolent association.

'The NYPD should stop trying to explain this staffing crisis away. Admit there's a problem and help us fix it,' he told The Post.

Lynch cited difficulty with keeping criminals behind bars and anti-cop sentiments as key factors driving the exodus.

NYPD officers are seen lounging against a cop car on August 10 as they await the arrival of former President Donald Trump at the office of the New York State Attorney General

Under new guidance, patrol officers cannot stand around and chat to one another while on duty, unless it is a 'police necessity'

For his part, Adams, a former cop himself, has called on judges and the New York State Legislature to do away with lax bail reforms, which see many offenders - even those with long rap sheets or a propensity for violent crimes - rapidly released from custody after committing an offense.

He said the 2020 reforms, ushered in under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and former mayor Bill de Blasio, made it impossible for criminals to be jailed for any meaningful period of time.

The department now faces stunning crime rates in the Big Apple. Overall crime is up by almost 32 percent from last year, according to the latest statistics from the NYPD.

Driving that increase is a notable increase in the number of robberies and assaults, which are up 43 percent and 22 percent, respectively.

Adams, himself a former cop, called on judges and the New York State Legislature to do away with lax bail reforms he says are keeping criminals on the street

Still, this is not the first time the mayor has directly ordered the NYPD to change its ways.

Back in May, Adams ordered officers to begin solo patrols in the subway system amid a rash of crimes. Those patrols were quickly modified just one day later, after a detective was assaulted while working on a Brooklyn subway platform by himself.

Then in April, the NYPD announced it was formally banning romantic relationships between bosses and underlings, apparently at the mayor's behest after a video showed a male supervisor getting a lap dance from one of his officers at a bar.",Q3

Lake, who is running for governor, and Finchem, the GOP nominee for secretary of state, filed a lawsuit in April seeking to ban the use of ballot counting machines.

It is full of claims that are demonstrably false, contends an attorney for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, Emily Crager.

Moreover, she told U.S. District Court Judge John Tuchi that “any reasonable investigation would have revealed’’ as much. That means Lake and Finchem violated court rules barring the filing of frivolous lawsuits, Crager said.

Crager told the judge the lawsuit “has no factual or legal basis’’ and was filed “for the purpose of undermining confidence in elections and to further their political campaigns.’’

She said the lawsuit is so chock full of false statements, some of which she called “complete fiction,’’ that Tuchi should dismiss it and fine the candidates and their attorneys.

Lake did not respond directly to Crager’s legal filing.

When asked about it by Capitol Media Services, Lake responded, “When are you going to cover my policies? You and the rest of the PHX area media look absolutely ridiculous.’’

Finchem called the county’s legal filing “nothing more than the attempted weaponization of the judicial process against the political process.’’

“If they can’t stand up to scrutiny for elections, that’s their problem, not our problem,’’ he told Capitol Media Services.

Tuchi has not said when he will rule.

Lake’s, Finchem’s claims

In filing suit, Lake and Finchem argued that the machines that tabulate ballots are unreliable because they are subject to hacking. They said the use of components in computers from other countries makes them vulnerable.

There is something even more basic, said the attorney who filed the lawsuit on their behalf, Andrew Parker.

He said the tabulation of votes is an inherently governmental function, yet by using machines built and programmed by private companies, the state has effectively farmed that out.

What’s worse, Parker said, is that the technology is kept secret from the public.

“This lack of transparency by electronic voting machine companies has created a ‘black box’ system of voting which lacks credibility and integrity,’’ he wrote in the lawsuit.

Lake and Finchem want a court order to have the 2022 election conducted with paper ballots that would be counted by hand, which the lawsuit calls “the most effective and presently the only secure election method.’’

Maricopa County’s rebuttal

Crager’s response starts with the contention that Arizonans vote by machine. “Both plaintiffs Lake and Finchem have voted on paper ballots for nearly 20 years,’’ Crager wrote. “Thus, their claims that Arizona does not use paper ballots are the very definition of ‘frivolous.’ ‘’

During all that time, she said, their votes were tabulated by machine. But Crager said there was no challenge in the early 2000s, nor when the county began using equipment from Dominion Voting Systems in 2019.

“Instead, they waited until they were running for statewide political office, when a significant portion of their likely voters had become erroneously convinced that the 2020 election was ‘stolen,’ ‘’ she wrote.

“Only then did they raise concerns about tabulation equipment, after having determined that promoting distrust in elections was politically profitable,’’ Crager continued. “Indeed, both plaintiffs are actively stating their intentions ‘not to concede’ and require a 100% hand recount of all ballots.’’

There are other specific problems with the lawsuit, she said.

For example, Crager said, the legal papers cite findings by Cyber Ninjas, the firm hired by Senate President Karen Fann to “audit’’ the results of the presidential and U.S. Senate races in Maricopa County. But she said many of the findings proved “blatantly false’’ and were based on the company’s lack of knowledge of election procedures and its plain “ineptitude.’’

Crager also said claims of what occurred in other states was irrelevant as the equipment used in Maricopa County is different.

And Crager told Tuchi a special master hired by the Senate confirmed the county uses an “air-gapped’’ system that protects against connection to the internet.

“This court should not countenance candidates filing a meritless lawsuit for political purposes, which asserts fictional violations of constitutional rights and is completely devoid of any factual basis, but furthers a false narrative that election results cannot be trusted,’’ she said.",Q3
https://techstory.in/lilium-to-set-up-industrial-capacity-to-build-400-air-taxis-a-year/,Lilium to set up industrial capacity to build 400 Air Taxis a year – TechStory,"German air taxi maker Lilium Air Mobility aims to set up industrial capacity to manufacture 400 electrically powered Lilium Jet flying shuttles a year. All the while, it is tapping schemes to provide public research support. The market for electric vertical take-off is getting competitive in the hope to replace road trips or short hops with aircraft trips.

However, the challenges of securing certification and funding the innovations such as fresh battery technology have weighed on the new sector. Lilium shares have fallen 73% so far this year. “I am pushing hard (for) a production system for 400 aircraft. And if by good luck one day, we need 800 we will just duplicate it, not here (in Germany)…but where the big markets are,” former Airbus executive Klaus Roewe told. Roewe joined the Bavarian start-up in August after experiencing what he described to Lilium’s shareholders on Wednesday as the “manufacturing hell” of ramping up production of larger planes as head of the A320-family program at Airbus.

“Let’s size it and let’s see how we have to design a production system including the whole supply chain for 400 aircraft,” Roewe said after a quarterly shareholder update. Lilium did not give detailed costs.

https://www.dailydot.com/irl/landlord-threw-stuff-away/,‘The law is on my side’: Woman says landlord threw away her stuff and changed the locks despite paying rent,"A Los Angeles-based TikToker has gone viral after sharing her story of being kicked out of her apartment, in which she had been residing and paying rent for two months.

Featured Video

In a series of four videos, user Kaci Jane (@ohitskacijane) documents the ordeal, including the landlord’s initial response and the eventual police involvement.

In the video that appears to have taken place first, Kaci Jane shows herself trying to enter her apartment accompanied by a team of professional security guards.

@ohitskacijane this was before after not getting help for 5 days from cops on the phone i spoke with with my lawyer who said I have every right to enter even if it meant breaking in which we didnt do. Being that this man is hostile, i hired licensed & profesional security to make sure he wouldnt hurt me. You can see for yourself how calm we all are while hes being incredibly hostile when i just want my things. This video was before the orhers fyi I have had sargeants & deputities involved taking care of this 110%. ♬ original sound – ohitskacijane

In this video, she identifies herself and explains that she just wants to get her belongings.

“This was before after not getting help for 5 days from cops on the phone,” she explains in the video’s caption. “I spoke with my lawyer who said I have every right to enter even if it meant breaking in which we didnt do. Being that this man is hostile, i hired licensed & profesional security to make sure he wouldnt hurt me.”

“You can see for yourself how calm we all are while hes being incredibly hostile when i just want my things,” she continued.

In another video, she shows her initial interaction with police, who appear to be understanding of her situation once they comprehend all of the details. The video also shows the moment when Kaci Jane realized that her belongings had been thrown away.

“I was a legal tenant there & he changed the locks, broke into my room, stole & damaged my things,” Kaci Jane explains in the caption of another TikTok.

A follow-up video shows the police’s interactions with the landlord.

In this video, the police officer remains calm, even as the landlord appears to threaten the officer.

“Ive had an amazing team of sargeants & deputities helping me since last friday,” Kaci Jane writes in the caption. “The law is on my side.”

A fourth video shows the aftermath of Kaci Jane having her clothes thrown away, which has involved “7.5 hours at the laundry matt & over $300 washing & rewashing the clothes that smelt so bad,” she claims in the caption.

“Had to throw away so much stuff,” she added.

According to the Los Angeles Housing Department, “A landlord cannot lock out or remove a tenant from their rental unit, even if the tenant is past due on rent or involved in eviction proceeding. The landlord must adhere to the unlawful detainer court process. Only a sheriff with a court order can execute a lockout after the tenant has been properly served with a valid notice, unlawful detainer summons, and either the tenant lost the case by default or at trial.”

Furthermore, “a tenant can seek legal assistance to regain possession of their unit and seek other damages.”

In comments, users showed their support for Kaci Jane and encouraged her to take further action.

“Don’t be scared to sue,” one user wrote. “Stack up evidence present it to lawyer bring all documents lease contract every detail every piece of cloth price n damages.”

“100% illegal , no matter the circumstances,” another added. “sue them for it & more. Landlords no matter the issues have to still follow protocols during the eviction.”

https://963theblaze.com/watch-crazy-footage-of-flash-flooding-in-downtown-helena-2022/,Watch Crazy Footage of Flash Flooding in Downtown Helena 2022,"It has been a wet and wild summer for much of Montana. I'm not talking about kids playing in the sprinklers or tubing down the river. I'm actually talking about the amount of wild water that has taken over much of the state.

Just recently we all witnessed footage of the historic flooding in Yellowstone National Park. Floodwaters managed to wash out multiple roads and bridges in the park. Forcing the entire park to close all of its entrances. Only recently have crews managed to get certain parts of the park open to tourists.

Other places Like Red Lodge, Montana saw floodwaters take out parts of the town. Washing away homes, businesses, and even giant steel bridges. Those waters inevitably made their way downstream and flooded larger communities like Billings. Where some residents had to conserve drinking water for a couple of days because the flood waters had threatened to contaminate the drinking water for the largest city in the state of Montana.

Even Montana's capital city experienced some of the floodings that have been rampant around the state. Just this past weekend, video footage surfaced of flash flooding overtaking the streets of downtown Helena.

According to KRTV

The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Helena area just before 7:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 3, 2022. A fast-moving storm sent a torrent of water down North Last Chance Gulch and other streets in and around downtown Helena. Businesses reported water damage, and the storm took out trees and tree limbs around the city.

Andy Shirtliff posted some amazing footage on Facebook that features patrons at a local bar doing their best to hold back the raging waters.

LOOK: Historic 2022 Flooding in Southern Montana Not Soon to Be Forgotten Widespread flooding wiped out roads, bridges, buildings, and powerlines throughout riverside communities from Yellowstone National Park and Paradise Valley to Red Lodge. The Yellowstone River winding through Billings crested Tuesday, June 14, 2022. At 11:30 a.m. the National Weather Service in Billings reported the river rose above flood stage and was forecasted to hit 14.7 feet, nearly hitting the 15-foot record set in 1997.",Q3
https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/india-born-former-masood-azhar-aide-could-be-going-separate-ways-1987169-2022-08-12,India born former Masood Azhar aide could be going separate ways,"A Hyderabad born former key manager of Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) could now be taking a separate path, away from the methods long dictated by the old regime headed by Masood Azhar and his brother Abdul Rauf Azhar.

According to new analysis of recently created social media accounts, Farhatullah Ghauri—a key JeM operative, has been using a network of online assets to amplify terrorist propaganda calling on Indian Muslims to revolt.

Often identified as ‘Ustad’ among the JeM ranks, Ghauri left India for Dubai in the mid 90s when he was about 30 years old. According to intelligence inputs, Ghauri—a follower of JeM chief Azhar, later moved to Rawalpindi in Pakistan and has been a key player in planning and plotting violent attacks in India since then. The JeM operative has been believed to undergo several surgeries during his stay in Dubai to protect his identity.

The report points out a suspected concerted attempt by an online network associated with Ghauri, often seen posting videos in Facebook groups and pages dedicated to socialism, Islam, and minority rights in India. “These groups are frequented by larger, more mainstream audiences of domestic users who are critical of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled government”, Ayushman Kaul, Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst at Logically observed in the report.

The report analysed three Telegram channels, two associated Facebook pages, and three YouTube channels operated by the group and noticed that the terror propaganda amplified via those channels consisted of professionally edited videos with voice-overs by Ghauri.

DEVIATING FROAM OLD JeM PATH

Although JeM’s conventional communication model has been using the social media platforms, there are certain contrasting differences that make Ghauri’s renewed campaign appear to be breaking the pattern from the established JeM campaigns. JeM’s communication has been centered on its mouthpiece Al-Qalam—a weekly paper published every Wednesday from Peshawar.

The magazine featured a regular column by Masood Azhar who wrote under the pen name, Sadi. It also featured write ups and info-graphics by other key JeM ideologues. Azhar’s key confidant Maulana Talha Saif was tasked to record readout of Azhar’s message that was circulated over social and digital media channels.

Following the February 2019 Indian Air Force airstrikes on Balakot, the magazine paused publication of its print copies.

However, in the following weeks, a new magazine named ‘Medina-Medina’ was floated by the group. The content of the new magazine has been more focused on religious preaching than lack the earlier political tone of Al-Qalam.

JeM’s social media wings, regularly use snippets of Masood Azhar’s old audio recordings, most recorded before year 2015 and create fresh multimedia propaganda material. Rauf continues to be the operational head of the organisation and is the second most heard leader in the JeM propaganda. Talha Saif is another prominent voice who is regularly featured in the terror organisation’s propaganda.

JeM also tried to sneak a proxy mobile app that was removed from Google play store in October 2021.

The campaign pattern mapped by Logically, suggests a deviation from the established JeM communication model. The production style is visibly different from the typical JeM multimedia content and looks closer to the campaign linked to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR)—the media and publicity wing of the Pakistan army.

Ghauri’s social media and digital assets have avoided showing affiliations with the JeM too. JeM’s conventional approach has been to unswervingly clash with the Indian government and any Pakistani elements that might oppose violence in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of India. Ghauri’s social media outreach is a more sophisticated information campaign that matches with the identified information campaigns associated with the Pakistani establishment and intelligence agencies.

“Pakistan-backed proxy terror groups will also seek to capitalize on the clash between communal groups and these off-line incidents of unrest and incorporate them into propaganda videos. These videos are then disseminated across major social media platforms in a bid to foster the next generation of home-grown extremists”, Kaul cautioned in his report.",Q3

Easing through: Iga Swiatek

NEW YORK: Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz reached the second round of a sweltering US Open on Tuesday as former champions Rafael Nadal and Naomi Osaka prepared to light up the New York night.

World number one and French Open champion Swiatek eased past Italy's Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 6-0 in just 67 minutes.

Victory was a relief for the 21-year-old Pole who had suffered early losses at warm-up events in Toronto and Cincinatti.

""In matches, being a little bit stressed and tight, it can get a little bit worse, but still, I feel like my level is just better,"" said Swiatek.

""We'll see if I'm going to hold on to that.""

Alcaraz, the 19-year-old world number four, was made to sweat by battling Sebastian Baez, winning the first two sets 7-5, 7-5 before the Argentine retired injured 0-2 down in the third.

""Nobody wants to see a match end like this. Sebastian is a great player, fights to the last ball and deserves better things,"" said Alcaraz, a quarter-finalist in 2021.

As the temperature soared beyond the 30-degree mark, Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina was the most high profile player to wilt.

The Kazakh lost 6-4, 6-4 to French qualifier Clara Burel, ranked a lowly 131, on the back of 37 unforced errors.

Britain's Cameron Norrie, the seventh seed, raced past France's Benoit Paire 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), 6-0.

Bizarrely, Paire started packing his bags at 0-5 down in the third set and he was a beaten man after only 98 minutes.

""Obviously it was really hot, and maybe towards the end of that third set he was playing really quick and trying to make the points really short, and maybe the heat was getting to him,"" said seventh seed Norrie.

The result made ugly reading for Paire who dropped the first set in just 18 minutes and the third in 19.

Sloane Stephens, the 2017 champion, defeated Greet Minnen of Belgium 1-6, 6-3, 6-3.

Czech 17-year-old Linda Fruhvirtova marked her main draw debut at the majors by seeing off Wang Xinyu of China 6-3, 6-4.

Later Tuesday, four-time champion Nadal begins his bid for a 23rd Grand Slam title and 20th win at the majors in 2022.

The 36-year-old Spaniard tackles Australian wild card Rinky Hijikata, ranked 191 and making his debut at the Slams.

Nadal comes into the tournament under an injury cloud after an abdominal strain forced him to forfeit his Wimbledon semi-final against Nick Kyrgios.

Since then, he has played just once, a first-up loss to Bornal Coric in Cincinnati.

""I take it very easy in the Cincinnati, too, in the practices. The match, I try my best without putting all the effort there on the serve,"" Nadal said on the eve of the US Open.

""I hope to be ready for the action. That's the only thing that I can say.""

Despite his caution, Nadal remains a title favorite in his first appearance in New York since his 2019 title triumph.

His chances have been boosted by the absence of old rival Novak Djokovic who was banned from entering the United States over his refusal to be vaccinated.

Japan's two-time champion Osaka completes the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium when she faces 19th seed Danielle Collins, this year's runner-up at the Australian Open.

Former world number one Osaka, the champion in New York in 2018 and 2020, is on a three-match losing streak in the US hard court season.

Osaka has won all three meetings against Collins without dropping a set.

The American arrives in New York having withdrawn from tournaments in San Jose, Toronto and Cincinnati with a neck injury.

Defending champion Emma Raducanu of Britain kicks off the night session on Louis Armstrong Stadium against France's Alize Cornet.

World number 40 Cornet is appearing in her 63rd consecutive Grand Slam, a new Open Era record, previously held by Ai Sugiyama of Japan.

After seeing Serena Williams stave off impending retirement by reaching the second round on Monday, big sister Venus eyes an 80th career win at the tournament.

Venus, 42, first played the US Open in 1997 where she finished runner-up.

Now ranked 1,504 in the world and without a win in just the three matches she has played in 2022, the American faces Alison van Uytvanck.",Q3
https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/solar-jet-fuel-production-from-co2-and-water-scaled-up-in-field-demo/4016002.article,Solar jet fuel production from CO2 and water scaled up in field demo,"In a world first, kerosene has been synthesised using solar energy, water and carbon dioxide in a fully integrated solar tower setup. An array of 169 spherical reflectors concentrated solar radiation onto a reactor mounted on a tower near Madrid, Spain providing the thermal energy for the conversion.

The reflectors deliver around 50kW of solar radiative power – equivalent to 2500 suns – directly into the 16cm wide aperture of the reactor. ‘There are reflecting mirrors which track the sun and redirect and concentrate the solar radiation to the top of the tower,’ says lead researcher Aldo Steinfeld at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.

The cornerstone technology is the solar reactor, which was field tested on the rooftop of ETH Zurich in Switzerland in 2021. This system captured carbon dioxide and water directly from the air and turned it into a fuel. The solar reactor thermally reduces the redox material, cerium oxide, at temperatures of around 1500°C. The cerium oxide then reduces carbon dioxide and water as it enters the reactor, generating carbon monoxide and hydrogen – syngas – which is then processed to synthetic fuel using off-the-shelf technology.

‘This is the first time that kerosene was produced from air on a real solar tower, not from a simulator,’ notes Christian Sattler at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Germany, whose group worked with Steinfeld’s. ‘This is a big step ahead, as it is crucial for further scale-up.’ DLR operates two solar towers to develop solar fuels.

‘This is still a demonstration for research purposes, but this time it is at a technical size and uses a solar tower configuration that are relevant for industrial application,’ adds Steinfeld. The solar reactor is around 10 times bigger than the 2021 field test and generates around 1 litre of kerosene a day. Similar solar towers and heliostat fields already operate commercially and generate electricity by producing steam to drive a turbine.

In the new set-up, a solar-to-syngas energy conversion efficiency of 4.1% was achieved. ‘This is a record value for thermochemical conversion of solar energy into syngas, but still a low value for making the technology economically attractive,’ says Steinfeld. He predicts that within the next five years, ‘we should be able to show efficiency values exceeding 10% and, in the longer term, as the technology matures, reach values over 15%’.

The aviation sector is responsible for generating around 5% of greenhouse gas emissions so there is a need for carbon-neutral kerosene to substitute fossil fuels.

The ETH Zurich group plans to improve the conversion efficiency of their process in three ways. First, the researchers will improve the composition of the redox material, for example with doped ceria or perovskites. The second is to improve the reticulated porous foam-like ceramic structures made of ceria to enhance heat and mass transfer. ‘We are working now with 3D printed structures that are able to absorb solar radiation more efficiently and obtain a more uniform temperature inside the cavity reactor and therefore have a higher conversion from solar energy to calorific value of the fuel,’ Steinfeld says.

The third way to improve efficiency is to recover heat lost during the redox cycle, when temperatures drop a few hundred degrees below that needed for the oxidation step. This heat could be captured and rerouted to the solar reactor.

It is ‘very exciting to see this technology demonstrated at scale’, says mechanical engineer Jonathan Scheffe at the University of Florida, who saw a presentation of the research by Steinfeld at the International Conference on Solid State Ionics in Boston. ‘It gives a clear pathway towards what we need to do to make this commercially viable.’

Swiss company Synhelion, a spin-out from ETH Zurich, is building the world’s first industrial facility for the production of carbon-neutral solar fuel in Jülich, Germany. ‘The commissioning of the plant is planned for 2023 and Swiss International Air Lines will be the first airline to fly with our solar jet fuel,’ said a spokesperson. ‘After that, we plan to commission the first commercial production facility in Spain by 2025.’

‘This demonstration is first an order of magnitude larger scale [than previous setups], outdoors in a tower configuration, with full integration of the three subsystems,’ notes Ellen Stechel, a chemical physicist at Arizona State University, US. ‘Others, ourselves included, have imagined this fully integrated system on paper and performed analysis of what is possible,’ she adds. ‘However, there is no substitute [for] actual demonstration with all the real-world complexities. Hence for the broader field this work is a major step toward commercialisation.’",Q3
https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/local/charges-duluth-shooting-tied-to-2021-homicide,Charges: Duluth shooting tied to 2021 homicide,"DULUTH — The brother of a 2021 homicide victim has been charged with shooting a man who was reportedly involved in the killing.

Juaquil Allen Anderson, 22, of Duluth, was charged Monday in State District Court with second-degree assault after allegedly wounding the victim during an armed scuffle early Thursday in the East Hillside neighborhood.

Juaquil Allen Anderson

Anderson is the brother of Juamada Keller Anderson Jr., who was fatally shot in May 2021 at the age of 22, according to court documents. Five people have been charged in connection with that case, with three cases still pending, including that of the alleged shooter, Patrick Wilson Battees Jr.

Authorities said the victim of Thursday's shooting is 33 years old and is ""believed"" to have been ""involved"" in last year's homicide. A criminal complaint does not give his identity and police would not confirm it, citing a statute that allows identities to be withheld in situations where the person's safety may be in danger.

Also charged Monday in connection with the incident was Randy Coleman, 23, of Duluth, who is currently under supervision in Wisconsin after serving prison time for a shooting outside a Superior strip club.

According to the complaint:

The victim showed up at Essentia Health-St. Mary's Medical Center in Duluth around 2:15 a.m. Thursday with two gunshot wounds to the chest. He was initially reluctant to give information, but eventually said he was with his girlfriend and several other people at an apartment on the 800 block of East Second Street.

The victim reported that he and his girlfriend got into a fight and she left the apartment. Juaquil Anderson and two other men then entered the residence, with Anderson pulling out what appeared to be a black 9 mm handgun.

The victim said he wrestled with Anderson over the gun and that it went off and shot him during the scuffle. He then went outside and asked his girlfriend to take him to the hospital.

The victim, who was treated and released from the hospital, ""explained that this happened because of the death of (Juamada Anderson).""

Shortly after noon Thursday, investigators stopped a Range Rover driven by Juaquil Anderson, with Coleman seated in the back. After executing a search warrant, police found a black 9 mm Smith & Wesson handgun wrapped in a plastic bag under the driver's seat near the rear passenger area.

Randy Coleman

Anderson, when informed that the stop was in regard to a shooting, allegedly laughed and claimed he was working into the early morning hours before going to a bar and, later, a friend's house on the 400 block of East Ninth Street.

Coleman told police that he knew Anderson's brother had been killed, but said he didn't believe Anderson had a conflict with anyone. Coleman said he was also at the Ninth Street house and was asleep from 2-9 a.m.

Investigators later executed a warrant at that address, finding numerous pieces of paperwork belonging to Coleman and a box of ammunition.

Police said they seized a total of three firearms during the investigation, one of them confirmed to be stolen.

Coleman is charged with unlawfully possessing ammunition or a firearm, as he is barred due to a conviction for third-degree drug possession. He was released from a Wisconsin prison in May and remains on extended supervision until 2026 after pleading guilty to first-degree recklessly endangering safety in connection with the shooting outside Lady Vi's in Superior in October 2020.

Juaquil Anderson has only a few petty misdemeanor convictions on his record, according to a check of court records in both states.

Judge Theresa Neo set Anderson's bail at $125,000. Coleman does not currently have a bail option, as he is being held on an alleged probation violation.",Q3

As LifeNews has reported, Joe Biden’s Justice Department clearly targeted a pro-life man and his family with a shocking home raid as an act of persecution.

Mark Houck made national headlines over the weekend after 20 heavily-armed federal agents stormed his home at dawn on September 23 — frightening his family, pointing guns at his head, and then arresting him in front of his wife and seven young children.

Biden’s FBI has raided the home of the well-known pro-life advocate and arrested him on a bogus charge that had already been thrown out of court. Biden’s administration is coming under fire for weaponizing the FBI and Department of Justice to target pro-life conservatives.

Fortunately, pro-life Americans have stepped up and are helping the Houck family in this battle:

More than 4,000 donations have been offered to Houck and his family, totaling $251,810 by Tuesday afternoon. GiveSendGo, an alternative to GoFundMe, allows users to submit prayers, too. So far, more than 3,500 prayers have been offered to the family. Pennsylvania pro-life activist Ashley Garecht and her husband Joe Garecht created the crowdfunding page. Notably, the couple’s daughters in 2019, then just 13 and 15 years old, were harassed by then-state Rep. Brian Sims (D) for several minutes as they prayed for unborn children outside a Pennsylvania abortion clinic. Garecht told The Daily Wire over the weekend that Houck was protecting his son from an aggressive Planned Parenthood escort harassing the boy. She said the case was dismissed by a federal court in Philadelphia when the escort tried to press charges, but Biden’s DOJ picked it up anyway. REACH PRO-LIFE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE!

Contact us today. “Last year, Mark and his son were praying in front of the [Planned Parenthood] at 12th and Locust,” the GiveSendGo account says. “When one of the escorts began harassing Mark’s son they walked down the street away from the entrance to the building. The escort followed them, and when he continued yelling at Mark’s son, Mark pushed him away.” The Garechts say the funds raised through the campaign “will go to help the family with any necessary expenses.” “Your generosity is greatly appreciated,” the couple adds. “Let’s show the Houck family they are not alone, while we show Planned Parenthood and its militant pro-abortion allies that the pro-life community will not be silenced by fear and intimidation.”

Houck, a father of seven, is frequently seen sidewalk counseling in front of Philadelphia abortion businesses to help women choose pro-life alternatives.

In September 2021, Houck was involved in an incident outside a Philadelphia abortion business where a pro-abortion clinic escort had repeatedly bullied and intimidated his 12-year-old son who was with him to help sidewalk counsel and encourage women to choose pro-life alternatives. After multiple verbal assaults and the abortion activist getting into his son’s face, Houck pushed him away and he fell.

Houck, who regularly prays the rosary outside the clinic, maintains he was defending his 12-year-old son from the escort’s verbal harassment, a family spokesman, Brian Middleton, told CNA. The man fell when Houck pushed him away, Middleton said. The incident was so minor that charges were never pressed and a court ultimately dismissed a complaint the abortion activist filed.

However, Houck is now alleged to have violated the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, commonly known as FACE, outside of a Pennsylvania abortion facility.

But, new information for Houck’s attorney, Thomas More Society Vice President and Senior Counsel Peter Breen, indicates Houck agree months ago to turn himself in voluntarily.

In June 2022, Thomas More Society attorneys notified the Biden Department of Justice that the FACE Act does not cover one-on-one altercations like the one involving Houck, which was initiated by the abortion proponent who was harassing Houck’s son. The Department of Justice was also advised that if the decision was made to bring a charge against Houck despite lack of legal foundation, Houck would appear voluntarily.

“Rather than accepting Mark Houck’s offer to appear voluntarily, the Biden Department of Justice chose to make an unnecessary show of potentially deadly force, sending twenty heavily armed federal agents to the Houck residence at dawn this past Friday,” explained Breen. “In threatening form, after nearly breaking down the family’s front door, at least five agents pointed guns at Mark’s head and arrested him in front of his wife and seven young children, who were terrified that their husband and father would be shot dead before their eyes.”

“This case is being brought solely to intimidate people of faith and pro-life Americans,” stated Breen. “Mark Houck is innocent of these lawless charges, and we intend to prove that in court.”

The case has drawn condemnation from pro-life members of Congress like Senator Josh Hawley and Congressman Chip Roy.

If the DOJ pursue the charges, it will be going agaisnt court precedent. In June 2019, Thomas More Society attorneys won a case in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, establishing that a one-off altercation, like the one in which the Biden Department of Justice is levying two counts against Houck, cannot form the basis for a FACE claim.

As CNA reports, the incident at the abortion center was so minor that local charges were never filed.

When both the city police and the district attorney declined to file charges against Houck, the escort filed a private criminal complaint in Philadelphia municipal court, Middleton said. The case was dismissed in July when the man repeatedly didn’t show up in court, Middleton said. Just days later, Houck received a “target letter” from the U.S. Attorney’s Office informing him that he was the focus of a federal criminal probe into the same incident, Middleton said. Through his attorney at the time, Houck tried to contact the U.S. Attorney’s Office to discuss the case but never received a response, Middleton said. “The next time they heard anything was Friday morning,” he said.

Biden’s Justice Department is now charging Houck with violating the FACE Act and Houck is now facing a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fines of up to $350,000 for merely defending his son from being attacked.

However, Houck never blocked access to the abortion center, which is what the law is designed to stop, and the incident was nothing more than a minor scuffle.

The Houck family is now panicked about what will happen to Mark from here. A GiveSendGo has been set up to help raise funds to support them and to assist with Mark’s legal defense.",Q3
https://discoverairdrie.com/articles/-airdrie-firefighter-remembers-his-fallen-colleagues,Airdrie firefighter remembers his fallen colleagues,"On Tuesday, September 13, the echoes of bell tolls reverberated outside Calgary City Hall as firefighters honoured their fallen colleagues in an annual memorial service. But what some may not know is that the Police Officers and Firefighters Tribute Plaza which opened in 2006, was originally initiated, among others, by an Airdronian.

While today the public and media know Deputy Chief of Operations Garth Rabel as a familiar face in Airdrie's Fire Department, Deputy Chief Rabel was a firefighter for 31 years in the city of Calgary.

""The Calgary Memorial is extremely meaningful to me personally because I was also on the group, a very small group of us that initiated the memorial.""

Two names that stand out at the memorial to the Deputy Chief are fallen firefighter Morley James and George R. Look. James died in 1992 during the Forest Lawn hotel fire, while Look died in 1981 in the Manchester Racket Club Fire. James' death saw an unprecedented outpouring of emotion from both the city's residents and his colleagues. News reports citing thousands of members of the public lined the streets during Morley's funeral procession. His heroic actions led him to be posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1998.

""I worked with both [of them] and was raised up early through my career with those two firefighters that we lost in the line of duty. George was working at 16 fire station, which was my old fire station. [The memorial] was an opportunity for us to come together, not only for the opening of that glorious memorial, but to actually start something meaningful, that would continue to ensure that people remembered the sacrifices that all first responders are prepared to make and, in this case, some of our own.""

Rabel comes from a family of firefighters. His brother was a firefighter and his own son also served in the Calgary Fire Department for over a decade. He said that there is always an inherent risk in the profession, but that does not mean that firefighters are reckless. Years of training, practice and more practice prepare firefighters to calculate the risks and while no amount of training can ever erase the danger, Rabel says that in the end, it is worth it, in order to make what could be one of the worst days of someone’s life a little more bearable.

And while September 13 is a deeply emotional day for Deputy Chief Rabel and many of his colleagues, the anniversary of September 11, which was also commemorated earlier this week has also been one of quiet reflection and contemplation. Traditionally, Airdrie's Fire Department displays their trucks at the front of the halls, and firefighters stand for a moment of silence, their helmets under their arms. This year, members from the Charlie Platoon at the 89 station (Chinook Winds Station) did something different.

""Some members chose to walk what would be [the] equivalent of 110 stories within our own building to represent the 343 firefighters [FDNY] that would have walked up to 110 stories to help people in need. We all do it our own way. I still take time. It's important for me to remember.""

Rabel, like so many, remembers his routine that Tuesday morning, 21 years ago, was shattered as his wife told him there was something he had to see. He watched in abject horror as the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan. The first thought was that a sightseeing plane had somehow collided with the building. By the time he had gotten to work and made his way into the Fire Chief's Boardroom, the second plane had hit the South Tower.

""None of us in our careers ever thought that those towers would come down. There have been extreme high-rise fires in cities and countries all over the world and never did a tower come down. Then to see those two massive towers come down like dominoes, it was just gut-wrenching,"" Deputy Rabel said. ""And then to understand the people and the firefighters that were still inside. It was... [I'll] never forget it.""

343 firefighters died on September 11, while many more have succumbed to various lung and respiratory-related cancers over the past two decades. Those cancers have also spurred fire departments across North America to shift their thinking on toxic chemical exposure and how to mitigate the risks of profession-related cancers. Many fire departments, Airdrie included, are now implementing strict decontaminating procedures for their members and being vocal about the fact that fires are only part of the danger firefighters face.

Deputy Chief Rabel admitted that the emotional toll of being a firefighter, whether it's personal traumas and tragedies that he has witnessed or those that his fellow colleagues have succumbed to, is a heavy burden to bear. However, in circumspection, he said time does allow one for emotional distance and a calmer reflection, one that offers hope for the future.

""That's what memories are for, they're supposed to make you feel sad, but then you think, there's something positive [that] had to come out of everything that's happened, and I believe that fire departments have really advanced the way that we approach large scale incidents,"" he said. ""In the case of industrial injuries or deaths, there's always learning to be taken away. How do we make workplaces safer? For Fire departments, how do we manage these scenarios more effectively? And what do we need to consider that we possibly didn't consider in the past?""

Although the memorial in Calgary is a sombre reminder to the public of just how much first responders are willing to sacrifice, for Airdrie's Deputy Chief, it is a place that also holds a sense of tranquillity.

""The memorial itself, you'll see it light up at night. I've always thought of it as a pathway from earth to heaven. I find those memories soothing. When I feel a little down, they keep me up, because we're in the business for the right reason and we did it with some remarkable people,"" he said. ""I think fire services; first responders sacrifice as well as anyone. We don't need credit for it. It's sewn into our fabric.""

Calgary has lost 58 firefighters in the line of duty, nine during active firefighting and 49 due to illnesses related to firefighting.

September is honoured as firefighter appreciation month.

TEXAS, USA — East Texas sheriffs are warning the public about an increase of dangerous drugs in the area.

Large amounts of fentanyl are surfacing in some counties, while other counties continue to battle the long-term methamphetamine problem.

The color blue is showing up in several street drugs, and Rusk County Sheriff Johnwayne Valdez said this usually means it's laced with fentanyl.

""Different drugs will put off different colors,"" Valdez said. ""You can actually make it whatever color you want. So depending on if there's fentanyl in it, or a good dose of fentanyl, a lot of times that blue will come out.""

Valdez posted this notice on the sheriff office’s Facebook page to warn parents what to look for and how fatal fentanyl can be.

""When you look at just small quantities, fentanyl can take your life,"" Valdez said. ""So when you look at eight pounds of fentanyl, it could literally wipe out the city of Henderson and probably a little bit more.""

According to Valdez, it’s not just pills like ecstasy being laced, but also methamphetamine and cocaine.

Rusk County isn’t the only one seeing this issue either. According to Gregg County Chief Deputy Craig Harrington, they’ve also seen a rise in fentanyl.

“Counterfeit pills such as “Xanax” which are normally not blue are being found blue in color,” Harrington said in a statement.

Meanwhile in Upshur County Sheriff Larry Webb said his office hasn’t picked up any signs of fentanyl in their area. Webb and his deputies continue to fight against the ongoing battle with meth.

""I'm not saying that it's not here,"" Webb said. ""Maybe it's not being recognized as being (fentanyl), it could have been taken into custody and processed as a different type of drug.""

Webb said thanks to the hard work of his special investigations unit they were able to confiscate about 80 grams of meth in their last bust.

""This is a combined effort and should be a combined effort because we're not winning this war on drugs,"" Valdez said. ""Until we as a society decide enough is enough, we'll continue to fight this war on drugs 'for decades, more to come.'""",Q3

https://www.dw.com/en/pakistan-taliban-kill-local-chief-in-former-stronghold/a-63113532,Pakistan: Taliban kill local chief in former stronghold – DW – 09,"A chief in the Swat valley who fought against Taliban militants has been killed by a roadside bomb. Recent attacks have marked a return to the the decades of violence that has left 80,000 dead.

The Taliban claimed responsibility on Wednesday for a bomb attack that killed a local pro-government militia chief in the Swat region of Pakistan on Tuesday.

Idrees Khan was killed by a roadside bomb, along with two police officers, two private guards, and three laborers, local police told French news agency AFP.

The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) — the Pakistani Taliban group is not directly connected to its Afghan counterpart, but shares a similar ideology — claimed that Khan had been involved in killing their members.

""We killed the leader of the peace committee Idress Khan in the area of Brai Bandi in the district of Swat with a bomb,"" the TTP said in a statement. ""Khan was involved in killing Taliban and torturing mujahedeen and their families in safe houses. The mujahedeen were pursuing him for almost 13 years.""

Attacks on the rise again

The Swat valley, in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which borders Afghanistan, had been a stronghold for the TTP.

They were kicked out by a major military operation between 2007 and 2009.

Residents have complained recently that the militant group, which aims to set up an Islamist state in Pakistan, has returned to the area.

Tuesday's attack was reported by DPA as the first in the Swat valley since the Taliban shot Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai in 2012.

Islamabad has also reported more attacks by the TTP since the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, especially along their largely porous shared border.

Reports of Taliban regrouping amid truce

Besides the attack in Swat, the TTP also claimed responsibility for a clash with Pakistani soldiers on Tuesday in the Kurram district on the Afghan border that left three soldiers dead.

Another attack that resulted in the kidnapping of at least seven people working for the Norwegian telecom giant Telenor in Swat on Tuesday also bore the hallmarks of a Taliban operation.

Recent weeks have seen mass demonstrations in the region against the central government's failure to act against the apparent regrouping of the militants.

The TTP agreed to an indefinite cease-fire with Islamabad in June as a step toward peace talks facilitated by their allies in Afghanistan. The series of attacks since then appear not to have broken the truce.

Some 80,000 people have been killed by the Pakistani Taliban over the years.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/8/10/23299684/bronzeville-shooting,"Man opened fire at a Bronzeville block party, killing man and wounding woman, prosecutors say","A man at a block party in Bronzeville pulled out a gun and opened fire following an argument in June, killing a man and wounding a woman, Cook County prosecutors said in court Wednesday.

Rashon Kyle, 23, “smirked” before raising the gun and began firing at a group of people he had been arguing with earlier, Assistant State’s Attorney Daniel Hanichak said.

Two rounds of gunfire from two different guns rang out at the party around 4 a.m. June 12 in the 4200 block of South State Street, Hanichak said.

Vincent J. Barnes was shot in his chest and pronounced dead. A woman who wasn’t involved in the argument was shot in her leg and hospitalized, Hanichak said.

The argument began when Barnes’ sister and an acquaintance were dropped off at the party, Hanichak said. The sister then met Barnes’ cousin who had driven her car there. Inside the car was a woman and Kyle in the backseat, Hanichak said.

For some reason, the acquaintance began arguing with the woman in the back seat, Hanichak said. While the two argued, they noticed a gun with an extended magazine in Kyle’s lap.

Barnes’ sister ordered everyone out of the car and she left to find her brother, Hanichak said. Kyle slapped the acquaintance before she left, Hanichak said.

Barnes’ sister returned, now with her brother and the acquaintance, Hanichak said. “As (they) got closer to where the defendant was standing, the defendant smirked and took out a handgun with an extended magazine and began firing at the victim,” Hanichak said.

Barnes’ sister and the acquaintance both identified Kyle as the shooter, Hanichak said. Another witness, Kyle’s cousin who drove the car there, was not cooperating with police, Hanichak said.

Kyle was arrested Sunday in the Brainerd neighborhood where he lives, and charged with murder, police said.

Police recovered 21 shell casings from two different guns, both from where Kyle was standing, Hanichak said. Thirteen casings were from 40-caliber gun, eight from a 9 mm gun, Hanichak said.

No witnesses mentioned a second shooter, Hanichak said. But there were also no witnesses who saw Kyle shooting a second gun.

In 2018, Kyle was sentenced to one year in prison for unauthorized use of a weapon. He also has three weapons-related convictions from when he was a juvenile.

Kyle’s brother was recently murdered, his attorney said. Kyle lives with his father and worked in fast-food restaurants and was working to get his GED, the attorney said.

Judge Mary Marubio ordered Kyle held without bail on a count of first-degree murder. His next court date was set for Aug. 29.

Conner Ellinghuysen, 2011 Above and Beyond honoree, helps college students in Iowa","Eleven years ago, Conner Ellinghuysen was Lewiston-Altura High School’s Above and Beyond nominee.

He shared with the Daily News at the time about his battle with anxiety, which he was diagnosed with in elementary school, as his father struggled to find work and his mother was on disability leave.

During the height of his battle, Ellinghuysen was too afraid to leave the house often and missed an average of about 30 days of school a year.

“Even as a child, Conner felt guilty that he couldn’t help support his family, and hesitated to go to school where he was taunted and bullied,” his 2011 Above and Beyond story shared.

But Ellinghuysen didn’t let his anxiety stop him, as he fought it head on starting in seventh grade. He became greatly involved in school and eventually graduated with a 3.54 grade point average.

After high school, Ellinghuysen went on to complete his undergraduate studies in 2015 and his master’s degree in 2017 at Saint Mary’s University.

In 2013, he was an intern at SMU before becoming an admissions counselor for the university in 2015.

After working his way up through the ranks at SMU, Ellinghuysen took a job at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa.

Ellinghuysen has held the position of director of admissions there since November 2019.

“I just had a desire to continue to work with students and help them realize their college dreams,” he said of his career choice. “I had a really great college experience and I had some really great mentors who saw something in me that just kind of pushed me towards this career path.”

Ellinghuysen ended up at his current position at BVU because he saw the opening as a great next stage in his career.

Additionally, he said: “I’m really passionate about rural education, because I grew up in a rural community of Lewiston, Minnesota. So this is a college that, we really believe and really serve rural education, and that’s kind of within our mission. And that’s something that’s really powerful to me and really exciting to be a part of.”

Ellinghuysen still takes lessons with him that he learned while battling anxiety in his youth.

“Well, I think the biggest thing was just learning how to essentially cope with it and and how to deal with those stressors and things like that. There’s a quote that’s on my computer that (says), ‘Nothing worth doing is ever easy,’” Ellinghuysen said. “I’m a Star Wars junkie, and it’s from one of my favorite characters, Ashoka Tano. It’s something that I’ve really started to live by.”

It’s a quote that he shares with his staff too, reminding them, “There’s going to be really tough times and sometimes when you’re working with students or things like that, there’s really heavy topics, but it’s a reminder that the work that we do really is worth it and at the end of the day, we really are truly inspiring and changing lives, whether we know it or not.”

While Ellinghuysen still deals with anxiety in his daily life, he shared that he has learned how to better understand and manage it.

When asked what he would tell youth who are facing anxiety themselves, just like he did at their age, Ellinghuysen said: “I think the first thing is, and I actually tell this a lot to college students, is to know that you’re not alone. It’s really easy when you’re in those moments where you think that you’re the only person going through anxiety or are struggling but the reality is there are other students that are around you that are probably going through the same thing. And it’s important for you to find your support network and try and open up to be honest with yourself with what you’re going through. Because those other people, once you find that group, they’re going to be there to help support you through that. You just can’t go through this alone.”

Ellinghuysen is now married to a fellow 2015 SMU graduate and has two children — a soon-to-be 2-year-old and a 1-month-old.

https://wibx950.com/new-york-museums-art-nazis/,New York Museums Must Now Disclose if Art Was Looted by Nazis,"According to a report from Maysoon Khan of the Associated Press, New York museums are now required to disclose to the public if any of their artwork had once been looted by Nazis during the Holocaust.

Get our free mobile app

The new law signed by New York State Governor Kathy Hochul requires museums to post signage that identifies pieces that were looted by the Nazis from 1933 through 1945. According to the report, at least 600,000 art pieces were looted from Jewish people in the years leading up to and during World War II.

This law, in addition to another New York law requiring museums to report stolen works to the Art Loss Register and a United States law that gives Holocaust victims and their heirs a the opportunity to recover those lost works, has made it easier to return stolen artwork to their rightful owners. Wesley Fisher, the director of research for the Claims Conference, told Khan ""This law did things legally that made it possible for people to make claims and sue. It isn't perfect, but it's better.""

Fisher also said ""Because the survivors of the Holocaust are a generation that is dying out, this becomes much more important. The object become much more important. The idea that students and general public should go through museums to understand where these items come from, is important.""

One of the most famous museums in the world, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, reportedly had identified 53 pieces of artwork that had been stolen by Nazis, but the museum says all of the pieces were acquired after first being returned to their rightful owners.

While this law only exists in New York, other famous museums like Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and The Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles also have programs designed to identify the history of their artwork relating to Nazi-era Germany.

PESHAWAR: After severe criticism and receiving aid, the KP government has claimed to raise the issue of US conspiracy during the recent visit of the US ambassador to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Provincial Finance Minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra confirmed the meeting and said that there was a 10-minute one-on-one meeting between Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and Ambassador Donald Blome in which the US interference and other issues were raised diplomatically, but he refrained from giving further details. He also declined to comment on the US ambassador’s reaction.

“The American ambassador had expressed his desire to visit the province and meet the chief minister. The meeting was planned with the permission of the party chairman. We knew that the two meetings, with the CM and with me would create a media controversy. However, after detailed deliberations, it was decided that optics should not dictate critical actions, and the said meetings were rightly arranged” Taimur said.

During the one-on-one meeting with the American ambassador, the CM registered a formal protest against the US conspiracy against the previous government of Imran Khan, credible sources confirmed.

However, the spokesperson of the US Embassy declined to divulge the details of the conversation between the Chief Minister and Ambassador Donald Bloom. “Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on private diplomatic meetings. Even off the record, I don’t have anything I can give you”, he said.

According to the sources, The chief minister raised three points, including the issue of US interference against the Imran Khan government, on which a formal protest was registered. Mahmood Khan told the US ambassador that the PTI wants to maintain relations with the US government on an equal basis but there should be no interference in Pakistan’s affairs. The US Embassy held meetings with dissident PTI members, which was highly inappropriate. He added that the KP government was grateful to the US government for its cooperation in the province.

He said Imran Khan’s stance on relations with the US was clearly communicated by CM. Multiple times during Imran Khan’s campaign in the last few months he has made this clear, we are not against any country, but we must make our decisions ourselves, independently.

“The second meeting was about USAID’s longstanding support to KP health, which we value. The entire theme of the engagement on health was that we are now at a stage where we value the support of development partners, but as partners, and on our agenda”, he said

Jhagra said there is a big difference between government-to-government cooperation and developing bilateral partnerships based on mutual self-respect, all of which we believe in - and know-towing to interests that do not serve Pakistan or compromise our self-respect. Our stance was and is clear.",Q3
https://poetsandquants.com/2022/09/03/a-wharton-mba-born-in-india-will-now-lead-one-of-the-worlds-iconic-brands/,"A Wharton MBA, Born In India, Will Now Lead One Of The World’s Iconic Brands","It is a job that Laxman Narasimhan could never have imagined for himself when growing up in Pune, India. But starting this October, Narasimhan will succeed one of the world’s most famous entrepreneurs, Howard Schultz, to become the new chief executive of Starbucks.

His journey to the top of a global icon started humbly and most notably with an MBA. The now 55-year-old Narasimhan has said he had to sell belongings and then borrow money to arrange for his visa to the U.S. and his studies at the Wharton School of Business in the early 1990s. During one summer, when he attended school in Germany, he only had enough money to pay for just one meal a day, losing ten pounds of weight in the process.

Like Indra Nooyi, born in Madras, and Satya Nadella, born in Hyderabad, Narasimhan has climbed his way to the very top of the corporate world with one critical step on that ladder: ban MBA from an elite U.S. business school. Nooyi, who earned her graduate business degree from the Yale School of Management, paved the way by becoming the CEO of PepsiCo. Nadella, who earned his MBA from the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, went to the top of Microsoft as chairman and CEO.

‘I THINK INDIA BUILDS IN YOU RESILIENCE AND FLEXIBILITY’

He acknowledges those pathfinders, including Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, also a Wharton MBA, for Indian-born CEOs. “You have to recognize some of these pioneers who broke through the grass,” he said in a recent interview with CNBC-TV18. “They took on great companies and found a way that you can be yourself and yet have a massive impact. These are real titans on whose shoulders we stand on. I think India builds in you resilience and flexibility to recognize that things may not be perfect but you have to find a solution. India gives you flexibility and agility. You combine that with the opportunity set that America or Europe provides and you end up with these people being truly successful.”

By all accounts, Narasimhan is a humble and highly likable man. He is known as “a fun person who joked easily, followed everything from rock to Carnatic music, and shared that he would rather read anything else other than business books, according to friends. He and his wife, originally from Bombay, have lived in 24 homes during their 29 years of marriage. He now will lead a company with roughly 35,000 stores and 383,000 employees globally.

“At heart, he is still the humble, warm and approachable guy we all grew up with,” Nitin Joshi, a school friend and classmate, told The Times of India. His old classmates keep in touch through a WhatsApp group of the 1982 batch from Loyola’s High School. Joshi says that despite Narasimhan’s busy work life, he consistently posts photos and updates about his life.

‘HE IS A BIG SHOT BUT HE IS JUST A REGULAR GUY’

“He is a big shot in the business world, but he is just a regular guy who does regular things with us,” added Joshi. “He goes to music concerts a lot and posts about them. A few days ago, he posted a photo with his mother and wife. He is always active in the group. A few days ago, he messaged that he won’t be posting anything for a while. This morning, we woke up to this amazing news and the group has been flooded with congratulatory messages.”

Higher education became an important step on the ladder of success for Narasimhan. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Pune in India. He graduated from the Lauder Institute with a master’s degree in German and International Studies and earned an MBA at the Wharton School in 1993.

The skills he learned in those programs led him to McKinsey & Co., recruited out of the Wharton School. Narasimhan spent the next 19 years of is life at the global consulting firm, becoming a senior partner and ultimately location manager for the firm’s New Delhi office. He focused on McKinsey’s consumer, retail and technology practices in the U.S., Asia and India and led the firm’s thinking on the future of retail. It was from that consulting and leadership role that he was hired away by PepsiCo in 2012, six years or halfway into Indra Nooyi’s successful run as CEO of the company.

‘PEPSI GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN HOW TO BE A CEO’

Over his seven years at the company, he collected the kind of experience that would catapult him into a CEO candidate. At PepsiCo, he rose to the position of global chief commercial officer, a role that had him reporting directly to the then chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, Nooyi’s successor. He was tasked with shaping PepsiCo’s integrated long-term growth strategy and leading the development of commercial and marketing capabilities. It was a wide portfolio of duties. Narasimhan oversaw the company’s Global Category Groups, Insights, Commercialization, Design, Global R&D, E-Commerce and Strategy.

But it did not last long. Within six months, he was poached from that new position in September of 2019 to become CEO of Reckitt Benckiser, the British conglomerate that makes Lysol disinfectant and Durex condoms. Looking back on his experience at PepsiCo, Narasimhan believes it prepared him for the top CEO job at Reckitt. “I had been at Pepsi for seven years and that experience gave me an opportunity to learn how to be a CEO, because I ran Latin America and then Latin America, Europe, and Africa before taking on the commercial role,” he told McKinsey in an interview. “I learned how to meet people, set direction, deliver performance.”

Reckitt was pretty much a wreck of a company, struggling with slowing sales and an ill-fated $16.6 billion takeover of the infant products maker Mead Johnson. What’s more, Narasimhan had to move from his home in Greenwich, Ct., to London for the new job only months before the COVID pandemic would turn everyone’s life upside down. By the end of January in 2020, the United Kingdom’s first two patients tested positive for Covid and the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency. Narasimhan found himself quarantined in a two-bedroom apartment with temporary furnishings in London with his 80-year-old mother, while his wife and two children remained in the U.S.

DINNER EVERY NIGHT WITH HIS 80-YEAR-OLD MOTHER IN LONDON

Recalls Narasimhan: “I was in the middle of a move to the UK when the pandemic hit. I have my 80-year-old mother here in a small apartment, so I am hyper-careful about COVID-19 exposure. I consider it a blessing that I have the chance to have dinner with her every day, but some days have been taxing. She might choose to come in while I am on a board call and say, ‘You have to take out the rubbish.’ I remember I was on an investor call and she had a point of view that she was choosing to express right at that moment.”

Though he was CEO, during the pandemic, he had to deal with basic life necessities. He recalls having to deal with whether there was enough food in the refrigerator for his mother and himself. During the company’s annual general meeting, at his apartment door was a delivery person from Tesco, the supermarket chain. “I went off screen and rushed to open the door and said ‘Just drop it where ever you can,’ and went back to the AGM. It’s very humanizing,” he remembered in an interview with CNBC.

Managing the company through that crisis shaped him. “You get much more reflective,” he told McKinsey. “This period has helped me understand what goes on inside the lives of the people who work for me. We have a thing where we open up the camera. I do these ‘Zoom-ins’ with young talent and I turn the camera around so they are virtually sitting in my living room, and they love that. In this way, I have been in people’s homes in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and Brazil, where I have never been in person, and they take me around the house and introduce me to their families. Understanding what they are going through has been helpful.”

‘FIRST AND FOREMOST, HE IS A TRUE SERVANT LEADER’

Though he only had the top job at Reckitt for three years, he has been widely praised for putting the company on a firmer footing. He wasted little time in cutting costs and selling underperforming divisions, while also smartly investing in the company’s supply chains and product research. The upshot: Reckitt has turned in four straight quarters of organic revenue above expectations, and in July, the company raised its revenue outlook for this year.

Now, he will take on Starbucks. “We were looking for somebody that was a true servant leader that had a deep sense of humility,” Schultz revealed in an interview with The New York Times. “Laxman first and foremost is a true servant leader.”

Narasimhan joins a growing list of Indian-origin CEOs taking charge of major U.S. companies. In addition to Nadella at Microsoft and Pichai at Alphabet, there’s also IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, Adobe CEO and Berkeley Haas MBA Shantanu Narayen, and Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal.

Last year, cosmetics giant Chanel had appointed Leena Nair, former top HR executive at Unilever, as its global CEO. In 2020 shoemaker Bata had appointed its Indian head Sandeep Kataria as its global CEO. Earlier in 2018, Vasant Narasimhan was appointed as the CEO of Novartis. Other Indian origin executives who have headed global firms include Ajay Banga who was the CEO of MasterCard for over a decade till early last year and Nooyi who stepped down as the CEO of PepsiCo in 2018.

“What was initially a trickle of water has turned into a Tsunami,” observes Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group. “The appointment of Indian-origin CEOs at the world’s most iconic companies is now an unstoppable trend. International boardrooms consider them to be almost safe leadership bets,” he said.

https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/lgbtq-state-lawmakers-express-concerns-about-future-of-same-sex-marriage-in-georgia,LGBTQ state lawmakers express concerns about future of same-sex marriage in Georgia,"A group of LGBTQ state lawmakers held a news conference at the state Capitol Monday to express their concerns about the future of same-sex marriage in Georgia after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

""I'm here today preemptively to let everyone know that I'm watching and that we're not going to go back into the shadows and be quiet about any of these issues,"" said state Rep. Karla Drenner, D-Avondale Estates.

Rep. Drenner was the first openly-gay lawmaker in the state when she took office in 2001.

She and others organized the event to respond to comments made last week by Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Georgia. He told Axios that his ""personal opinion"" is that marriage is between a man and a woman.

In 2004, voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the Georgia Constitution that bans same-sex marriage. Kemp, who was a state senator at the time, voted in support of that resolution in the state legislature.

That amendment prohibited gay marriage in Georgia until a Supreme Court ruling in 2015 made same-sex marriage legal across the United States.

""Governor Kemp's position on same-sex marriage has not changed. This issue has been settled by the U.S. Supreme Court,"" a Kemp campaign spokesman said in a statement to FOX 5.

The issue has recently resurfaced though because Justice Clarence Thomas suggested as part of his opinion on Roe that the court reconsider that.

When the Supreme Court reversed its position on abortion this summer, the issue then went back to individual states to decide, and Georgia's ""heartbeat"" abortion ban, which Gov. Kemp signed in 2019, went into effect.

""Brian Kemp has been clear that it is his 'personal' belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman and I think he says 'personal' so that maybe we not become alarmed, but what we know is that when Brian Kemp has personal beliefs, he imposes those into law,"" said state Sen. Kim Jackson, D-Stone Mountain.

Some state lawmakers fear that gay marriage could meet the same fate if the state's leadership does not change.

""We cannot afford four more years of Kemp and Republican extremists in complete control of state government,"" said state Rep. Sam Park, D-Lawrenceville. ""Now is the time that we must rise up to meet the challenges we face. Our future remains in our hands,"" said Rep. Park. ""By the power of the vote, we can move Georgia forward and elect leaders who believe that all Georgians deserve equal protection under the law and who will take action to protect the fundamental constitutional rights of all.""",Q3

Russia said the Odesa strikes hit military installations. DW rounds up the latest.

Ukrainian forces will continue to inflict as much damage on Russia's military as possible, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Sunday.

""Even the occupiers admit we will win,"" he added. ""We hear it in their conversations all the time. In what they are telling their relatives when they call them.""

Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was not letting up, as the conflict entered its sixth month on Sunday.

""We do everything to inflict the highest possible damage on the enemy and to gather for Ukraine as much support as possible.""

As the country prepared to mark the day of Ukrainian statehood, a national holiday, on Thursday, the president said ""we will celebrate against all odds. Because Ukrainians won't be cowed.""

Here are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on July 24.

Moscow: Odesa strikes targeted military facilities

Russia confirmed firing missiles at Odesa but insisted the targets were only military installations.

""Kalibr missiles destroyed Odesa port's military infrastructure"" including a ""Ukrainian military boat,"" said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Sunday.

The defense ministry said the attack also destroyed a warehouse where US-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles were kept. According to the statement carried by the Interfax news agency, the strike also crippled a ship repair facility.

The Saturday strike came only one day after Ukraine and Russia agreed to allow the export of grain in a UN-brokered initiative.

The deal was struck with the help of Turkey.

The port is crucial for any grain export from Ukraine.

Steinmeier: Putin waging 'war against unity of Europe'

Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine is also ""a war against the unity of Europe,"" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Sunday.

""We must not let ourselves be divided, we must not let the great work of a united Europe that we have begun so promisingly be destroyed,"" he said in a speech at the Libori Festival in Paderborn.

""This war is not just about the territory of Ukraine, it is about the double shared foundation of our values and our order of peace,"" he said.

Steinmeier called on people to be prepared to defend those values and also to ""accept significant disadvantages,"" in doing so.

""Are we ready for that? We are all facing this question, today and in the days, weeks and months to come,"" he said.

Canadian believed to be a foreign fighter killed in Ukraine

Canada said on Sunday that one of its citizens died in Ukraine.

""Global Affairs Canada is aware of the death of a Canadian in Ukraine. Consular officials are in contact with the family and are providing consular assistance,"" a Canadian foreign ministry spokesperson said, without providing further details.

On Saturday, Politico reported two Americans, a Canadian and a Swedish citizen, were killed this week when a Russian tank opened fire on them in the eastern Donetsk region.

They were fighting with the Ukrainian military, Ruslan Miroshnichenko, the foreign fighters' commander, told the publication.

The deaths of the two US citizens were confirmed on Saturday by the State Department.

Ukraine speculates it will retake Kherson by September

A Ukrainian official has speculated that the military will retake the southern Kherson region from Russian forces by September.

Sergiy Khlan, an aide to the head of the Kherson region, told Ukrainian TV that Ukrainian forces were ""prevailing"" in recent military operations.

""We can say that we are switching from defensive to counteroffensive actions,"" the AFP news agency quoted him as saying to state TV.

Kherson was captured by the Russians shortly after their invasion of Ukraine in February. Long-range artillery recently supplied by the West has however emboldened Ukrainian troops.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, has quoted Khlan as saying that Ukrainian forces have already seized some settlements in Kherson.

Khlan however urged Ukrainian civilians to refrain from addressing any progress on the ground until the Ukrainian military officially announces it, the AP news agency reported.

Kherson is an integral region for Ukrainian agriculture. It is close to the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.

Pope Francis says he wants to visit Kyiv

Speaking to reporters on a flight from Rome to Canada Sunday, Pope Francis said he had a ""great desire to go to Kyiv"" to try and bring an end to the five-month-long war.

The pontiff told Reuters news agency earlier this month that he hopes to visit Kyiv and Moscow after his trip to Canada.

No pope has ever visited Moscow. Pope Francis has condemned what he has called Moscow's ""cruel and senseless war of aggression"" in Ukraine.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy slams 'Russian barbarism' in Odesa

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed the reported missile strikes on the Black Sea port of Odesa and said they undermined Russia's political position.

""This apparent Russian barbarism brings us even closer to obtaining the very weapons we need for our victory,"" Zelenskyy said,

Ukraine's president accused Moscow of shelling the port of Odesa a day after an agreement for the export of Ukrainian grain was signed in Istanbul.

""If anyone in the world could still say that some kind of dialogue with it, with Russia, some kind of agreements are needed, see what is happening,"" Zelenskyy said.

""Today's Russian Kalibr missiles have destroyed the very possibility for such statements,"" he stressed.

Zelenskyy also said that Ukrainian forces were ""advancing step by step"" toward recapturing the southern Kherson region, most of which has been under Russian occupation since the early stages of Moscow's invasion.

North Korea echoes Russian claim of US 'biolabs' in Ukraine

North Korean state media on Sunday accused the US of setting up biological weapons facilities in Ukraine, echoing a Russian claim that was dismissed by the UN in March.

The US ""set up many biological labs in tens of countries and regions, including Ukraine, in disregard of the international treaties,"" the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, claiming such labs were ""detected"" by Russia.

There was no immediate reason provided as to why KCNA repeated the accusations at this time.

North Korea is allied with Moscow and has recognized two self-proclaimed pro-Russian separatist ""republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv subsequently cut diplomatic ties with Pyongyang.

The US and Ukraine both deny the Russian bioweapons lab claims. The US has said allegations from Moscow are a sign that Russia may be using such tactics itself.

Ukraine to continue preparing for grain exports — infrastructure minister

Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said that Kyiv was continuing to prepare to restart grain exports from its Black Sea ports despite a missile strike that hit Odesa on Saturday.

""We continue technical preparations for the launch of exports of agricultural products from our ports,"" Kubrakov wrote on Facebook.

Kubrakov accused Moscow of aiming to ""ruin [Ukraine's] infrastructure"" and destroy its economy. He added that Russia had shown the world its ""true intentions"" by launching a missile strike on the Odesa port.

Kyiv says 5,000 women fighting for Ukraine on the front

According to Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar, 5,000 women are currently fighting on the front as part of Ukraine's armed forces.

Maliar said that more than 50,000 women serve in Ukraine's army in total.

Maliar made the comments at an international summit for First Ladies and Gentlemen, held in Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

UN chief Antonio Guterres said he ""unequivocally condemns"" the strikes in Odesa and top EU diplomat Josep Borrell called the attacks ""reprehensible.""

Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said that Russia ""told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and they were looking into the issue very closely.""

Law Enforcement Division jointly announced criminal indictments Thursday against disbarred South Carolina attorney Richard ""Alex"" Murdaugh in connection with the 2021 double homicide of his wife and younger son.

The Colleton County Grand Jury has charged Alex Murdaugh with two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime in the deaths of his wife, Maggie, and his son, Paul.

While the S.C. Attorney General's Office is prosecuting the case, the indictments were ""true billed"" in the county where the homicides occurred. The felony charges were signed and unsealed Thursday.

More:What we know, and don't know, about the Alex Murdaugh crime saga

The indictments allege that Murdaugh shot and killed his wife, Maggie, with a rifle, and shot and killed his younger son, Paul, with a shotgun. No other details were included in the indictments.

Murdaugh's attorneys Jim Griffin and Richard Harpootlian denied the allegations from the onset with a statement issued just minutes after the charges were announced by the state.

""Alex wants his family, friends and everyone to know that he did not have anything to do with the murders of Maggie and Paul. He loved them more than anything in the world,"" the statement from attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin reads. ""It was very clear from day one that law enforcement and the Attorney General prematurely concluded that Alex was responsible for the murder of his wife and son. But we know that Alex did not have any motive whatsoever to murder them.""

The attorneys plan to immediately file a motion for a speedy trial, that the Attorney General's Office turn over all evidence within 30 days and that a trial be held within 60 days of receiving that evidence, according to the statement.

Because this is an active investigation and is now a pending court case, Attorney General Alan Wilson said he cannot comment on specifics.

However, he did state in a release, “All the efforts of our office and the law enforcement agencies involved in this investigation have been focused on seeking justice for the victims’ families. We want to thank the State Law Enforcement Division, the attorneys and staff in our office, and everyone who worked on this case for their tireless efforts to gather evidence and follow where it led. We also want to thank the Colleton County Grand Jury for listening to that evidence and for their service to the people of the state.”

“Over the last 13 months, SLED agents and our partners have worked day in and day out to build a case against the person responsible for the murders of Maggie and Paul and to exclude those who were not. At no point did agents lose focus on this investigation. From the beginning I have been clear, the priority was to ensure justice was served. Today is one more step in a long process for justice for Maggie and Paul,” said SLED Chief Mark Keel.

A bond hearing will be held Wednesday, July 20, at 10 a. at the Colleton County Courthouse before Judge Clifton Newman.

Officials announced the pending charges the day before, and on Wednesday Murdaugh's former family law firm, now called Parker Law Group, posted the following statement on its website:

""Today’s news (7/12/22) is sad and upsetting. Our thoughts turn to Maggie and to Paul whom we loved and who we miss. Every day we grieve for them. Justice must be served. If the charges reported today are true and just, we ask for our judicial system to act swiftly and to bring a conclusion to this heinous situation.""

Murdaugh called 911 at 10:07 p.m. and reported that he had found the pair unresponsive and lying on the ground near the family's dog kennels. At the time of his death, Paul Murdaugh was facing three felony boating under the influence charges related to the February 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach, 19, of Hampton.

Since the killings, the S.C. Attorney General's Office and the S.C. Law Enforcement Division (SLED) have uncovered a web of financial and drug crimes allegedly involving Murdaugh that span more than a decade in several S.C. Lowcountry counties.

Prior to today's charges, Murdaugh was already facing a total of 84 criminal charges and 11 civil suits and is being detained in Richland County's Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center on a $7 million bond he has been unable to meet.

Judges don’t like to be on the losing side of votes.

But there are times when a loss creates opportunity. So it was for Missouri Supreme Court Judge Robert Eldridge Seiler in October 1981. Seiler, who served 15 years on the state’s top court, found himself on the losing side of an appeal of a capital murder conviction.

The defendant in the case, Michael White of St. Louis, had been convicted in 1980 of capital murder in the 1979 shooting death of Susie Hawkins. White wasn’t present when Hawkins was killed. A teenager named Hardy Bivens killed her, using White’s gun. White had been driving Bivens around that day, and was outside in a car when the murder took place. According to testimony at his trial, White had no idea Bivens was going to kill anybody.

At trial, though, the judge told the jury that White’s state of mind didn’t matter. To convict him of capital murder, a potential death penalty offense, all the jury had to do was find that Bivens had acted with evil intent and premeditation. The jury could apply Bivens’ intent to White, the judge instructed them.

When the case came before the Missouri Supreme Court, Seiler had a problem with that standard. His dissent in the case pointed to the clear fallacy in that logic:

“Beyond question,” Seiler wrote, capital murder “requires a culpable mental state, and evil intent. This necessarily must be true of one who aids in a capital murder as well as of the one who actually does the killing. It is unthinkable that it would require less in the way of a culpable mental state to be convicted as an aider in capital murder, where the death penalty is possible, than it does to be convicted as the principal.”

White was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Today, he’s 61, and he’s still behind bars at the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Meanwhile, Bivens, the man who actually did the crime, is a free man. That’s because he was 17 at the time of the murder, just a few months younger than White, and the courts have realized over time the cruelty of locking people up for their entire lives for crimes committed when they were children.

The courts, like the brains of children, evolve over time. So it is for Seiler’s dissent. In 1993, in another murder appeal, State vs. O’Brien, the Missouri Supreme Court decided that Seiler was right. It changed case law to require a jury to find premeditation in an accomplice before it could convict such a defendant of murder.

It’s the only logical ruling, says Kansas City defense attorney Kent Gipson. Making it easier to convict an accomplice compared to the person who actually committed the crime makes no sense. Neither does this, Gipson says: Last month, despite the change in case law, the Missouri Supreme Court dismissed his motion to “recall the mandate,” which if approved would have led to White being released from prison.

“It’s baffling to me,” Gipson says. “I can’t imagine a more clear-cut case. It ought to be open and shut.”

In the O’Brien ruling, the court specifically says it has overturned its previous ruling in White’s case. When attorneys search the White case in legal databases, it now has a red flag by it, indicating it is no longer good law. But, according to the Missouri Supreme Court, the bad law is enough to keep White in prison.

The injustice weighs heavily on White, who has always maintained his innocence.

“I came to prison at 19 years of age, a school kid, working 40 to 60 hours a week after school, never been in trouble before and the Missouri Supreme Court has decided that 44 years later I deserve to continue to pay with my life for a crime they’ve known from day one I didn’t commit,” he told me in an email. “Everything about this case was wrong from the beginning.”

For Gipson, this renews an ongoing battle with Missouri’s top court, where even innocence is often not enough to free a defendant. In a variety of recent Missouri cases involving actual innocence — Kevin Strickland, Lamar Johnson, Christopher Dunn, Michael Politte — the court has questioned the process by which defense attorneys and prosecutors seek to overturn convictions, and thus delayed justice by months or years.

This week, Gipson plans to file a habeas corpus petition on White’s behalf in Cole County, since his direct appeal to the Supreme Court failed. It’s a longer process that could take another couple of years to reach the court again, and allow the judges to determine whether Seiler’s four decades old dissent will finally be used to free the man who inspired it.",Q3

The Mosquito Fire burning in Northern California flared up Tuesday afternoon, charging toward a mountain community and torching more homes as it burned dangerously close to a high school.

The inferno — the largest wildfire currently burning in California — began west of Lake Tahoe amid extreme heat September 6 and has already consumed 58,544 acres in El Dorado and Placer counties. It was 20% contained Wednesday.

Burning intensely and spreading deeper in the Sierra Nevada mountains, the fire has forced more than 11,200 people to flee as it threatened thousands of structures, burning 64 structures by Wednesday, including at least 25 homes, according to Cal Fire.

The fire grew more than 8,000 acres overnight.

By Tuesday afternoon, the fire pushed toward the community of Foresthill and arrived at the edge of Foresthill High School, torching structures across the street as firefighting aircraft raced to drop flame retardant over the raging blaze.

Aerial video from CNN affiliate KCRA showed the flames burning a row of cars and structures under thick, black smoke.

It was not immediately clear how many buildings and vehicles were lost in the flare-up, but firefighters appear to have kept the flames away from Foresthill High School, Cal Fire Public Information Officer Scott McLean told CNN.

Though firefighters were aided by calmer weather over the weekend, stronger southwest winds blew into the region Tuesday, breaking up a smoke inversion that had for days hung over the Mosquito Fire.

As the trapped smoke cleared in the afternoon, the flames exploded, and a spot fire jumped the Middle Fork of the American River on the west corner of the fire’s perimeter and ran toward Foresthill, ripping through critically dry fuels and steep terrain.

Flames advanced from the El Dorado County side back into Placer County, below the communities of Todd Valley and Foresthill, Cal Fire Operations Section Chief Landon Haack said during an evening briefing.

Firefighting resources that were trying to stop the fire’s spread in other areas were diverted to help hold the line below the community, authorities said.

“They’ve got a pretty significant firefight going on out there right now as we speak. They’re trying really hard to hold that fire in that box right there,” Haack said.

The fire had jumped an area with twists and turns in the river where the wind swirls and pushes smoke and embers, Cal Fire fire behavior analyst Jonathan Pangburn explained in the briefing.

Additional evacuations were ordered Tuesday afternoon, including for the community of Stumpy Meadows, according to the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office.

The Mosquito Fire continues to push steadily to the east in heavily forested areas with extremely dry vegetation, officials said.

Before winds cleared the smoke Tuesday, it created unhealthy air quality in the region due to a high concentration of particulate matter from the fire in the air.

The smoke rolled past state lines and into Nevada, where the U.S. Air Quality Index reported “very unhealthy” air quality.

The fire is one of many burning across the West that are choking the air with smoke. More than 800,000 acres have burned in 93 large active fires and complexes across the West, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

In Oregon, the lightning-sparked Cedar Creek Fire has quadrupled in size since last week, burning about 92,548 acres as of Tuesday and was still burning with 0% containment.

Fires are burning in parched lands amid a relentless drought

Frying under rising temperatures, drought-ravaged Western states are home to growing areas of easy-to-burn dry brush that can become fuel for more volatile wildfires.

The fires are also burning amid a water shortage emergency that is forcing residents to limit outdoor watering as California’s reservoirs shrink.

In the Golden State, residents are contending with unprecedent water restrictions. The Metropolitan Water District for the first time ever declared a water shortage emergency in April, limiting outdoor watering for millions of residents in dozens of cities in Southern California.

For the third month in a row, Los Angeles residents cut their water usage last month to an all-time low for any August on record, despite temperatures that were an average of 3 to 5 degrees warmer, the city’s mayor Eric Garcetti said.

Los Angeles residents’ water usage in August was 10% lower than in the same month in the past two years, according to Garcetti.

“In the face of monthly heat records, Angelenos have gone above and beyond to find additional ways to cut back — and as we continue to battle skyrocketing temperatures and cope with drying reservoirs, I know that Los Angeles will continue to show our region and the rest of the world what meaningful conservation looks like,” the mayor said in a statement.

https://readthereporter.com/elwood-police-officer-killed-in-line-of-duty/,Elwood police officer killed in line of duty,"Suspect found & arrested in Hamilton County early Sunday morning

Elwood police officer Noah Shahnavaz was shot and killed Sunday morning. Carl Roy Webb Boards II, 42, Anderson, was arrested in Hamilton County after a chase involving the Sheriff’s Department and Fishers PD. At press time, Boards was being held in the Hamilton County Jail on initial charges of murder with a firearm enhancement as a habitual offender.

According to the Herald Bulletin, Shahnavaz, 24, was a five-year military veteran who had been with the Elwood Police Department for 11 months. He is survived by his parents and siblings.

Just after 2 a.m. Sunday, Officer Shahnavaz conducted a traffic stop on a 2012 Buick LaCrosse near the intersection of State Road 37 and County Road 1100 North in Madison County. Boards exited the Buick and fired multiple rounds, striking the officer at least one time. Boards then fled the scene in the vehicle.

According to the Indiana State Police, officers from Elwood PD and the Madison County Sheriff’s Department found the wounded officer and gave life-saving aid until medical personnel arrived. The officer was taken by ambulance to Ascension St. Vincent Mercy in Elwood, and later flown by helicopter to an Indianapolis area hospital and was then pronounced dead, police say.

Just after 2:30 a.m. Hamilton County Sheriff’s Department found the Buick and attempted to initiate a traffic stop. The driver of the Buick did not stop and continued southbound on SR 37, according to ISP. Officers continued to pursue the Buick and put a tire deflation device near the area of SR 37 and 146th Street. The Buick continued southbound on SR 37 toward Interstate 69.

Fishers PD conducted two precision immobilization techniques (PIT). After the second PIT, the Buick became stuck at the median barrier wall and became immobilized, which allowed officers to take the suspect into custody.

Madison County Chief Deputy prosecutor Andrew Hanna told the Herald Bulletin that Boards has a lengthy criminal record that includes a conviction in 2006 for firing a weapon at Indiana State Police officers.

Shahnavaz’s body was returned on Sunday afternoon to Madison County from the hospital in Indianapolis, passing through Hamilton County on I-69, with a Sheriff’s Department and local police escort.

This is an active and ongoing investigation, according to ISP. At the completion of the investigation, this case will be turned over to the Madison County Prosecutors Office.

NETFLIX'S new series based on the crimes of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer has left viewers all asking the same question - what was in the sandwich?

Jeffrey Dahmer, also known as the ''Milwaukee Cannibal'', is seen handing the snack to his neighbour Glenda Cleveland.

Did Jeffrey Dahmer give Glenda Cleveland a sandwich?

In Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, we see Evan Peters take on the role of Jeffrey Dahmer - the man who murdered and dismembered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991 in the US.

In one scene, Dahmer hand his neighbour Glenda a sandwich, which she turns down.

But, as with all dramatisations, not everything we see on screen is exactly as it happened.

Glenda in fact did not live in the same apartment building as the killer.

In reality, Cleveland lived in the building next door, and according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel there was never any confirmation that she had ever met Dahmer.

However, the media outlet instead speculates that Cleveland’s character was combined with that of another neighbour named Pamela Bass.

And interestingly, Bass was the one who claimed Dahmer made sandwiches for others in the building in real life - meaning there may be some element of truth in the dramatised storyline.

What was in the sandwich?

As viewers watched the scene, they quickly took to social media to speculate the contents of what they believed to be a grisly snack and they all assumed the same thing - that the sandwich was made using human remains.

This hints at the real Dahmer's confession of eating some of the organs of his dead victims.

Speaking in 2013 documentary The Jeffrey Dahmer Files, Dahmer's neighbour Bass spoke about her worst fear after being given the sandwich by the man she described as appearing to be friendly and sharing.

In the documentary, she said: “I have probably eaten someone's body part.''

Was Jeffrey Dahmer a cannibal?

Dahmer confessed to the rape and murder of 17 young men and boys between 1978 and 1991.

He also confessed to eating some of his victims - and therefore being nicknamed ""The Milwaukee Cannibal"".

He is thought to have lured his victims to his apartment and drugged them before chopping them up and eating them.

When he was arrested in 1991, at the age of 30, cops discovered a grisly scene when entering his apartment.

They found partly cooked human flesh as well as a human head stored in the fridge.

Dahmer received 16 life sentences for his crimes.

He was killed by fellow Columbia Correctional Institution inmate and convicted murderer Christopher Scarver on November 28, 1994, in Portage, Wisconsin.

Scarver removed a 20-inch metal bar from the prison weight room and brutally hit Dahmer twice around the head.

Dahmer was declared dead an hour after arriving in hospital.",Q3

Soldiers of Aryan Culture (SAC) are a brutal prison gang with Nazi links. Their racist members have swastika tattoos and some have committed heinous crimes including murder, drug trafficking and gun offences

They're one of the most brutal, violent and callous 'white power' prison gangs in the US - and the Soldiers of Aryan Culture show no signs of simmering down any time soon.

Back in 1997, Utah prisoner Tracy David Swena, or Tinman to friends and enemies, founded SAC, a group of white supremacists while behind bars on weapons charges.

‌



Like other white power prison gangs, they are strongly anti-Semitic, showing hatred and aggression towards Jews.

The gang's members also live by a strict code that says they must attack known sex offenders and police informants.

‌



In addition, they are forbidden from cooperating with law enforcement and mixing in with other races, unless high ranking members who make up the leadership approves of it.

Tracy David Swena founded SAC and the gang's philosophy (Image: Utah State Prison )

Disobeying the rules can put a gang member in grave danger from the other members of the group.

‌



According to reports, in order to be a member you have to be invited by a lieutenant or sergeant as the gang has a ranking structure ranging from generals, captains, sergeants and soldiers.

The more criminal activity you commit, the quicker you rise through the ranks.

Despite the invitation, members are placed on a six to 12-month probation filled with missions - typically attacks on other inmates - and once membership is approved, they receive an SAC tattoo which is a swastika interwoven with an Iron Cross.

‌



Steve Mark Swena, Tracy's brother, when he was arrested back in the 1990s (Image: Utah State Prison )

Swena, who was released from prison in 2021, wrote the gang's philosophy in 2001. It calls for members to “honour pure white power” and “defend” the gang's integrity.

The mission statement reads: “We’re skinheads in all definitions of this term, we are soldiers consumed by our political, ethnic and blood identities, that make us brothers and sisters in the truest and purest form.

‌



""For you are eternally your brothers' or sisters' keeper and bound by blood, oath and honour to defend the integrity of our eternal white family.”

It adds: “Members must show loyalty courage ethnic pride and a diligent effort to preserve promote and honour pure white power.”

Gang members have to be invited to join the group (Image: Utah State Prison )

‌



Over the years the gang has gained a reputation in Utah as one of the most brutal criminal organisations.

In 2002, just months after the 9/11 attacks, SAC gained notoriety after members, along with another white supremacist prison gang, Silent Arya Warriors, allegedly planned to attack Jewish athletes at the Winter Olympics held at Salt Lake City using pipe bombs.

Five years later in 2007, two prison guards escorted SAC members Mark Isaac Snarr and Edgar Balthazar Garcia through the jail but the prisoners were able to free themselves before stabbing the guards several times with makeshift knives.

‌

They grabbed the guards' keys and the two of them made their way into the cell of another inmate, Gabriel Rhone, and stabbed him 50 times.

Rhone was serving a life sentence for an armed robbery in Washington, D.C.

‌



It is believed that the brutal attack on Rhone was due to his apparent escalating bizarre behaviour. The guards survived the attack but sadly, Rhone did not.

Snarr and Garcia were charged with first-degree murder in 2009 and the following year, both assailants were sentenced to death as punishment for the incident.

Most recently, in October 2020, 21 members of the SAC, Silent Aryan Warriors, and Noble Elect Thugs were charged in Utah with distribution of drugs including heroin and methamphetamine, and firearms following a joint local-federal investigation.

MIAMI — It's one of the seafood industry's most gruesome hunts.

Every year, the fins of as many as 73 million sharks are sliced from the backs of the majestic sea predators, their bleeding bodies sometimes dumped back into the ocean where they are left to suffocate or die of blood loss.

But while the barbaric practice is driven by China, where shark fin soup is a symbol of status for the rich and powerful, America's seafood industry isn't immune from the trade.

A spate of recent criminal indictments highlights how U.S. companies, taking advantage of a patchwork of federal and state laws, are supplying a market for fins that activists say is as reprehensible as the now-illegal trade in elephant ivory once was.

A complaint quietly filed last month in Miami federal court accused an exporter based in the Florida Keys, Elite Sky International, of falsely labeling some 5,666 pounds of China-bound shark fins as live Florida spiny lobsters. Another company, south Florida-based Aifa Seafood, is also under criminal investigation for similar violations, according to two people on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing probe. The company is managed by a Chinese-American woman who in 2016 pleaded guilty to shipping more than a half-ton of live Florida lobsters to her native China without a license.

The heightened scrutiny from law enforcement comes as Congress debates a federal ban on shark fins — making it illegal to import or export even foreign-caught fins. Every year, American wildlife inspectors seize thousands of shark fins while in transit to Asia for failing to declare the shipments.

While not all sharks are killed just for their fins, none of the other shark parts harvested in the U.S. and elsewhere — such as its meat, jaws or skin — can compete with fins in terms of value. Depending on the type of shark, a single pound of fins can fetch hundreds of dollars, making it one of the priciest seafood products by weight anywhere.

“If you’re going out of business because you can no longer sell fins, then what are you actually fishing for?,” said Whitney Webber, a campaign director at Washington-based Oceana, which supports the ban.

Since 2000, federal law has made it illegal to cut the fins off sharks and discard their bodies back into the ocean. However, individual states have wide leeway to decide whether or not businesses can harvest fins from dead sharks at a dock, or import them from overseas.

The legislation working its way through Congress would impose a near-total ban on trade in fins, similar to action taken by Canada in 2019. The legislation, introduced in 2017 by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, has majority support in both the House and Senate.

Among those opposing the proposed ban is Elite, which has hired lobbyists to urge Congress to vote against the bill, lobbying records show.

It's not known where Elite obtained its fins. But in the criminal complaint, the company was also accused of sourcing lobster from Nicaragua and Belize that it falsely stated was caught in Florida. The company, affiliated with a Chinese-American seafood exporter based in New York City, was charged with violating the Lacey Act, a century-old statute that makes it a crime to submit false paperwork for any wildlife shipped overseas.

An attorney for Elite wouldn't comment nor did two representatives of Aifa when reached by phone.

Overfishing has led to a 71% decline in shark species since the 1970s. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a Switzerland-based group that tracks wildlife populations, estimates that over a third of the world's 500-plus shark species are threatened with extinction.

Contrary to industry complaints about excessive regulations, the U.S. is hardly a model of sustainable shark management, said Webber. She pointed to a recent finding by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that less than 23% of the 66 shark stocks in U.S. waters are safe from overfishing. The status of more than half of shark stocks isn’t even known.

The situation in Europe is even worse: a new report from Greenpeace, called “Hooked on Sharks,” revealed what it said is evidence of the deliberate targeting of juvenile blue sharks by fishing fleets from Spain and Portugal. The report found that the U.S. is the world's fourth-largest shark exporter behind Spain, China and Portugal, with exports of 3.2 million kilograms of meat — but not fins — worth over $11 million in 2020.

Webber said rather than safeguard a small shark fishing industry, the U.S. should blaze the trail to protect the slow-growing, long-living fish.

“We can’t ask other countries to clean up their act if we’re not doing it well ourselves,” said Webber.

She said the current laws aren't enough of a deterrent in an industry where bad actors drawn by the promise of huge profits are a recurrent problem.

Case and point: Mark Harrison, a Florida fisherman who in 2009 pleaded guilty to three criminal counts tied to his export of shark fins, some of them protected species. He was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and was banned from having anything to do with the shark fin trade for five years.

But federal prosecutors allege that he reconnected to associates of his former co-conspirators in 2013 in violation of the terms of his probation. He was arrested in 2020 on mail and wire fraud conspiracy charges as part of a five-year investigation, called Operation Apex, targeting a dozen individuals who also allegedly profited from drug trafficking. Prosecutors allege Harrison's Florida-based Phoenix Fisheries was a “shell company"" for individuals based in California, where possession of fins has been illegal since 2011.

As part of the bust, the Feds found documents about some 6 tons of shark fin exports and seized 18 totoaba fish bladders, a delicacy in Asia taken from an endangered species. They also seized 18,000 marijuana plants, multiple firearms and $1 million in diamonds — pointing to a criminal enterprise that transcended illegal seafood and stretched deep into the Mexican and Chinese mafia underworlds.

“This operation is about much more than disrupting the despicable practice of hacking the fins off sharks and leaving them to drown in the sea to create a bowl of soup,"" Bobby Christine, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia, said at the time.

An attorney for Harrison declined to comment on the case, which has yet to go to trial. But unlike his co-defendants, Harrison isn't implicated in any drug-related or weapons offenses. Supporters say he has complied with all laws and is being unfairly targeted by bureaucrats overlooking the key role he played in the 1980s, when sharks were even more threatened, developing the U.S. shark fishery.

“They appear to be using the current widespread empathy toward sharks for publicity and career advancement in what would otherwise be a very routine matter,” reads a website run by supporters seeking to raise $75,000 for a “Shark Defense Fund"" to help Harrison fight the charges.

“In the process, they are seeking to tarnish Mark’s reputation and deal a blow to the American shark fishery,"" according to the website, which was taken down after the AP started making inquiries.

Demian Chapman, who heads shark research at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida, said that the push to ban commercial fishing of sharks could backfire.

“If you subtract the U.S. from the fin trade entirely, it won’t do anything to directly affect international demand and it’s likely that other countries, with far less regulation of their fisheries, will fill the void,” said Chapman.

He said the bill introduced by Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat of New Jersey, appears to be driven by “shark fans” — not “shark fins” — and those who want to see the fish species afforded the same very high level of protection afforded to marine mammals and sea turtles. He said few in the U.S. are involved in the cruel, wasteful practice of shark finning and that the U.S.' role as a transit hub for fins can be remedied without punishing American fishers.",Q3

Families said they're concerned that there could be other victims and said those who had the same route as the bus driver was never notified.

During a special board meeting last week, in a 5-2 vote, the trustees voted to hire another law firm to conduct a third-party investigation, but parents who participated in the protest on Monday are demanding more.

“The superintendent, the school principal, anyone who knew this, we are asking them to step aside while the investigation is resolved,"" said Chastain.

During Tiki Week, Columbia's Main Street Cajun-creole restaurant and whiskey bar transforms into a kitschy, island-themed bar adorned with tiki inspired decor and a list of cocktail drinks from the tiki bar era that followed the second world war.

The week, which used to be held in the winter months to offer an oasis from the cold, started taking place in the summertime after restaurant owner Kristian Niemi acquired the next door Blue Flour Cafe space in 2021.

The event at the Main Street spot will begin on July 12 and tropical treats last through July 30, with over a dozen cocktails curated by Niemi and Bourbon's head bartender Kat Hunter including the classic Mai Tai and The Zombie, a well-known tiki cocktail created in the 1930s by bartender Donn Beach. Niemi said that over half of the cocktails will be Bourbon originals.

Tiki bars gained popularity in the '40s after the concept was established by Donn Beach in 1933 with his Hollywood bar Don The Beachcomber. The casual bars, decorated with Polynesian-esque memorabilia like wooden carved tiki statues paired with fruity, sweet cocktails, drew in customers looking for an ""island escape"" — something that became a staple of the bars, according to Eater.

In recent years, the once-trendy style has been denounced by some for cultural appropriation — in 2019, the Los Angeles Times criticized the concept in an article entitled ""Tiki bars are built on cultural appropriation and colonial nostalgia. Where’s the reckoning?""

Writers from major publications like Eater, the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times have analyzed the controversial and somewhat misunderstood history of the bars — most authors take issue with the use of significant cultural and religious symbols being used for kitschy, cheap decor without the input of people from those cultures. The Los Angeles Times's John Birdsall noted that some criticize the bars as a ""crude imperialist fantasy that has treated the South Pacific as a source of escape.""",Q3

A document on the pop-rock band shows a spy attended a performance on their inaugural 1967 tour and reported that they were trying to spread an anti-US message to the audience.

The informant reported back: 'During the concert, subliminal messages were depicted on the screen which, in the opinion of [informant's name redacted], constituted ""left wing intervention of a political nature"".

The Monkees' sole surviving member Micky Dolenz is suing the FBI to force them to hand over files they kept on the band (pictured left, alongside fellow band member Mike Nesmith who died last year)

A document on the pop-rock band shows a spy attended a performance on their inaugural 1967 tour

'These messages and pictures were flashed of riots, in Berkley, anti-US messages on the war in Vietnam, racial riots in Selma, Alabama, and similar messages which had unfavorable response[s] from the audience.'

This section of the band's FBI file was released a decade ago but Dolenz, 77, has now sued to gain access to the whole document after failing via a Freedom of Information Act request.

The suit, seen by Rolling Stone, states: 'This lawsuit is designed to obtain any records the FBI created and/or possesses on the Monkees as well as its individual members.

'Mr. Dolenz has exhausted all necessary required administrative remedies with respect to his [Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act] request.'

It was filed on his behalf by attorney Mark S. Zaid, an expert in FOI litigation who previously represented the government whistleblower who revealed information about Donald Trump and Ukraine, which led to his impeachment.

Zaid was a big fan of The Monkees after his babysitter gave him her collection of albums in 1975.

J. Edgar Hoover was notorious for monitoring countercultural movements in the US and The Monkees were one of the most popular bands in the country

He went on to see them on tour in 1986 and met Dolenz, a drummer and vocalist, through mutual friends.

The lawyer said it would be interesting to know if the FBI had a file on the band, not realizing a portion had been released in 2011, and he vowed to find out more.

J. Edgar Hoover was notorious for monitoring countercultural movements in the US and The Monkees were one of the most popular bands in the country in the late 1960s.

Anti-war sentiments featured in their songs Ditty Diego-War Chant and Last Train to Clarksville.

Zaid filed an FOI request in June to see the complete file for the band as well as individual files on the band members.

The agency is required to comply within 20 working days but it really happens.

Zaid said that means they will likely head to court.",Q3

(Credit: Florida Highway Patrol)

A Florida Highway Patrol trooper is recovering after being hit while at a crash on the Cape Coral Bridge on Sunday.

The driver who hit the trooper didn’t violate move-over laws but was still cited for careless driving.

Whether responding to a crash on a bridge or the interstate, every time a trooper gets out of their cruiser, they risk their lives because traffic never stops, and too often, a driver is just not paying attention.

The trooper hurt in Sunday’s crash is home from the hospital.

The FHP trooper was stopped, waiting for a car to be towed away. That is when crash investigators say a 50-year-old man veered into the lane of the parked FPH cruiser and rear-ended him.

The force of the crash pushed the trooper’s car into the wreck he responded to in the first place.

“If you are traveling on a roadway and you’re approaching that scene, my goodness, don’t hit anybody. Control your car, slow down, do everything that you’re expected to do as a responsible adult behind the wheel of a three-4000 and up pound vehicle,” said Florida Highway Patrol Lieutenant Greg Bueno.

That driver now must answer a careless driving citation but will not face a move-over law violation because the crash took up one of the two lanes of traffic, so there was no other lane for traffic to move over into.

Bueno wants all drivers to be cautious, especially when there’s law enforcement on the side of the road.

“You always have to be 100% focused, aware of your surroundings, looking ahead, trying to, you know, foreshadow or see any obstructions or any traffic congestion or slowdowns so that you can control your vehicle. And at the end of the day, that is your responsibility as a driver,” said Bueno.

There are more than 400,000 car crashes in Florida every year, according to the latest Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles report.",Q3

https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/iran-salman-rushdie-fatwa-satanic-verses-stabbed-america-rcna43181,Iran gave Salman Rushdie a fatwa for 'Satanic Verses.' But he was stabbed in America.,"On the first day of school, my first grade teacher instructed us that if we heard our parents playing music at home, if they had certain books of poetry on their shelves, if they drank wine, if they danced, if they invited friends over, if our mothers dressed immodestly, if our fathers listened to unsanctioned radio stations, if we saw our school friends at the park without hijabs, we should report these things to her immediately. A good student followed the rules of Islam.

What happens in a society where freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas are silenced? “It becomes impossible to think,” Rushdie explained.

I wanted to be a good student. I wrote my alphabet with meticulous handwriting in my state-issued notebook so that she might give me a star. I stood in the school line on cold autumn mornings and swore my allegiance to Islam and the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. I recited the names of the 12 imams of Shia Islam in front of the class. I walked straight home from school passing young men with guns who volunteered their time to police morals and arrest dissidents.

In the evenings, my parents spoke in whispers while I did my homework, until one afternoon they told me I wouldn’t return to school the following day, that we were leaving Iran. I worried about missing class and not learning how to read. My father assured me that I still would as he packed my notebook in the single suitcase we were taking. In the lining, he also hid two volumes of poetry, a book by Sohrab Sepehri, another by Forough Farrokhzad.

In America, I practiced my cursive on worksheets. My father listened to the radio each evening. My parents invited friends over. Sometimes they danced. Sometimes they read poetry. There was always music. By and by, I learned to write words, and then, in one moment, I learned to read. I sounded out the same paragraph, over and over, until suddenly the words opened themselves for me and there I was, in an attic with a girl named Anne, hiding.

One evening, my father asked me if I knew of a writer named Salman Rushdie. “I would like to buy his book,” he said. I asked him why, since he couldn’t read well in English. “Perhaps you can read it and tell me what he has to say,” he told me. My father was raised Muslim. I have a picture of him as a little boy on a pilgrimage to Mashhad to pray at the shrine of Imam Reza. He wanted to read what Rushdie had written, to come to his own conclusions, to understand why Iran demanded the silencing of this author after his book “Satanic Verses” came out.

Shortly after its publication, and soon before Khomeini’s death in 1989, someone had told him that the book made the Prophet Muhammad seem irreverent and insulted the prophet’s wives by naming prostitutes after them. The supreme leader issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie to be killed. Twenty countries banned the book. A Japanese translator of “Satanic Verses” was murdered and three others were attacked. Riots over the book left 45 people dead, 12 of whom perished in Rushdie’s hometown of Mumbai. Copies were burned in the streets and bookstores were firebombed.

Rushdie went into hiding under the protection of the British government for nearly a decade. More recently, he has managed to lead a relatively normal life in New York. During all that time, he has spoken extensively about the freedom of expression. Indeed, the conversation scheduled to take place on the stage in Chautauqua, New York, where he was stabbed Friday, was meant to be about the United States as a refuge for the freedom of creative expression.

After the attack, when I told my mother I wanted to write something about Rushdie, about silencing, about the sanctity of the written word, she pleaded with me not to. “It’s too dangerous,” she said. “You don’t know what they can do.” She carries this fear from the country we fled. There, journalists are imprisoned. Writers are killed.

But the silencing of writers by the state is slowly becoming a reality in America, too. This fall, school districts across the country are pulling books with “sensitive material” out of their curriculums. Librarians are asked to remove volumes from their shelves or risk losing funding. Teachers are forbidden from teaching certain topics in their classrooms or risk being fired and are, in at least one state, facing criminal prosecution.

The same week of the attack on Rushdie, the board of a Utah school district decided to “temporarily restrict” access to 52 books, many of which address gender, sexuality and identity. Last year in a school district in California, officials disallowed any text that uses the N-word, leading to a handful of books being removed from the curriculum, including Martin Luther King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” in which he uses the word to define its abusive nature.

And the government isn’t the only entity suppressing free speech in America. Rushdie and some 150 other writers, addressing the current climate of “cancel culture,” stated in an open letter published in Harper’s Magazine in 2020 that “an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty” is equally detrimental to the freedom of expression. On one hand, books about being gay are banned from American schools and libraries; on the other, author J.K. Rowling’s statements on gender, which many LGBTQ advocates find offensive, culminate in death threats on Twitter.

What happens in a society where freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas are silenced? “It becomes impossible to think,” Rushdie explained in a 2006 interview, “it becomes impossible to have any kind of interchange of thought in a society if you are told there are ideas which are off limits.”

Much will be made of the young man who stabbed Rushdie. Was he radicalized on his monthlong trip to Lebanon to visit his father? Was his act inspired by Khomeini’s fatwa? This New Jersey man, raised in America, how was he corrupted? Fingers will undoubtedly point East.

To bridge this defensive, separated world that America has become, we need the freedom to express our ideas without the fear of being silenced, shunned, persecuted, fired, shamed, banned.

But there are so many young men in America like him, committing atrocities in schools, in supermarkets, in movie theaters, at parades, all in the name of their convictions. The argument shouldn’t be about the nature or the origin of the ideology. Instead, we should ask ourselves what absence of varying, diverse views left them feeling alienated. What echo chamber of dogma bred such rigidity of thought? In response to the London bombings of 2005, Rushdie wrote, “from such defensive, separated worlds some youngsters have indefensibly stepped across a moral line and taken up their lethal rucksacks.”

The miracle of the moment when I learned to read was not a matter of fluency, it was the shattering of a wall. When I entered that attic through a book and looked out of the window beside that hidden girl, I learned something I would never have otherwise known. Books should be triggering, they must shake us to our core, beat at the edifices of our ideas and send them crumbling down so that we can build better, stronger, more complex ones. Dialogues need to cause dissonance, moments that force us to hold conflicting beliefs because it is precisely in these moments of discomfort that learning happens.

To bridge this defensive, separated world that America has become, we need the freedom to express our ideas without the fear of being silenced, shunned, persecuted, fired, shamed, banned. Rushdie explains that we construct our identities through grand narratives, how the idea of nation and family and community are all stories — and the “definition of any living, vibrant society is that you constantly question those stories, you constantly argue about it. In fact, the argument never stops, the argument itself is freedom.”",Q3
https://mg.co.za/world/2022-07-06-democracy-under-serious-and-sustained-attack-from-within-the-us/,Democracy under serious and sustained attack from within the US,"The US has been a constantly evolving democracy ever since it was founded in 1776, but its survival as a democracy is now gravely endangered. A set of loosely interconnected developments at home and abroad is responsible for this crisis.

From abroad, the US is threatened by repressive regimes led by Xi Jinping in China and Vladimir Putin’s Russia who want to impose an autocratic form of government on the world.

But the threat to the US from the domestic enemies of democracy is even greater. They include the current supreme court, which is dominated by far-right extremists, and Donald Trump’s Republican Party, which placed those extremists on the court.

What qualifies the majority of the court as extremists? It is not merely their decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 case that recognised a woman’s right to choose whether to give birth. What qualifies them as extremists is the arguments they used to justify their decision and the indications they gave of how far they might be willing to go in carrying out those arguments.

Justice Samuel Alito, the author of the majority opinion, based his ruling on the assertion that the 14th Amendment protects only those rights that were generally recognised in 1868, when the amendment was ratified. But this argument endangers many other rights that have been recognised since then, among them the right to contraception, same-sex marriage, and LGBTQIA+ rights.

Carried to its logical conclusion, this line of reasoning could even allow states to ban interracial marriage, as some did until 1967. It is also clear that this court intends to mount a frontal attack on the executive branch. One of the most consequential rulings of the court’s just-completed term denied the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations needed to combat climate change.

It doesn’t take long to find the common denominator in the court’s recent decisions: support causes promoted by Trump’s Republican Party and weaken or outlaw causes favoured by the Democratic Party. Consider gun laws. The court’s radical wing listens closely to the pro-gun lobby. So, though a recent epidemic of mass shootings created such a national outcry that even some Republicans supported a new federal gun law, the court compensated the National Rifle Association for the loss by striking down a longstanding New York law that placed strict restrictions on carrying concealed handguns (New York State immediately passed new gun laws, that are likely to end up before the supreme court).

The supreme court used to be among the most highly respected institutions in the US. Through its recent decisions, the extremist majority has driven its approval rating to a historic low, and disapproval of the court to new highs. The dissenting opinion in the case that overturned Roe v Wade flatly stated that the majority decision “undermines the court’s legitimacy.” Unfortunately, the minority is likely to remain in the minority for a long time, because the extremists are younger and hold a majority of six to three.

There is only one way to rein in the supreme court: throw the Republican Party out of office in a landslide. That would allow congress to protect through legislation the rights that had been entrusted to the protection of the supreme court. It is now clear that doing so was a big mistake. Congress must act, starting with protecting a woman’s right to choose. If the filibuster must be amended to achieve that, so be it.

But when it comes to organising a landslide victory against the radicalised Republicans, opponents face almost insuperable obstacles. Republicans have not only stacked the supreme court and many lower courts with extremist judges. In states such as Florida, Georgia, and Texas, they have enacted a raft of laws that make voting very difficult.

While these laws focus on disenfranchising African Americans, other minorities and young voters generally, their ultimate goal is to help Republicans win elections. As a Florida federal judge recently wrote in striking down one of these laws, they were enacted “with the intent to restructure Florida’s election system in ways that favour the Republican Party over the Democratic Party”.

These laws would be bad enough if they only targeted who can vote. But Republicans are now going even further, by attacking the vote-counting and election-certification process. From changing the law to make subversion of the electoral system easier, to recruiting believers in Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him to oversee the process, we are watching Republicans attack the US system of democracy from every angle. And here, too, the radical supreme court has done its part, gutting the federal Voting Rights Act and allowing naked partisan redistricting to weaken minority voting power.

Fortunately, I am not alone in claiming that the survival of democracy in the US is gravely endangered. The US public has been aroused by the decision overturning Roe v Wade. But people need to recognise that decision for what it is: part of a carefully laid plan to turn the US into a repressive regime.

We must do everything we can to prevent that. This fight ought to include many people who voted for Trump in the past. I am a supporter of the Democratic Party, but this is not a partisan issue. It is about reestablishing a functioning two-party political system which is at the core of US democracy. — © Project Syndicate

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/08/26/alabama-pastor-arrested-watering-flowers/,"Black pastor arrested while watering a neighbor’s flowers, video shows","Michael Jennings was watering flowers for his out-of-town neighbor in May when an officer approached him. Within minutes, he was arrested, handcuffed and in the back of a police cruiser, video released by his lawyer this week shows. “I’m supposed to be here. I’m Pastor Jennings. I live across the street,” he told the officer during the May 22 exchange in his neighbor’s driveway in Childersburg, Ala.

“I’m looking out for their house while they’re gone, watering their flowers,” he added.

The 20-minute video captured his subsequent arrest. An initially friendly encounter with three officers escalated when Jennings declined to show identification, accused police of racially profiling him, threatened to sue and dared them to arrest him. After the two sides got into a shouting match, the officers did just that, accusing Jennings in the video of obstructing a government operation, a charge that was dismissed in June by a municipal judge, said one of his lawyers, Harry Daniels, in a statement.

The Childersburg Police Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post late Thursday. Jennings told ABC News he cooperated with police even though he was agitated because he feared being shot.

“To be shackled and to have your freedom taken away from you, it’s something else. It’s dehumanizing, and I thought, ‘Why would they be doing this?’ It’s something that — it gives you nightmares,” he said during the interview. Jennings, 56, has been a pastor at the Vision of Abundant Life Church for more than 30 years.

The chain of events that ended in Jennings’s arrest started when one of his neighbors, not recognizing him, called 911 to report a suspicious person outside her neighbors’ house. The couple living there had gone out of town.

The body-camera video shows that, when the first officer arrived, he greeted Jennings with a “Howdy,” and Jennings replied by saying, “Hey, man, how’s it going?” It devolved from there.

The officer told Jennings that someone had called police to report a strange man around the house who was “not supposed to be here.” Jennings identified himself as “Pastor Jennings” and said he lived across the street. When the officer asked for an ID to prove that, Jennings balked, saying he hadn’t done anything wrong.

“You want to lock me up, lock me up. I’m not showing y’all anything,” Jennings said. “I’m going to continue watering these flowers. I don’t care who called y’all. Lock me up and see what happens.”

Alabama law allows law enforcement to demand someone in a public space identify themselves, give their address and explain their actions if the officer “reasonably suspects” that person has committed or is about to commit a felony or other public offense.

In their statement, Jennings’s lawyers said that their client didn’t have to provide police an identification because “he was not in a public place.”

After declining to provide an ID, Jennings walked away. Officers followed and handcuffed him before the two sides got into a shouting match. The officer who first approached Jennings then began to arrest him, the video shows.

A few minutes later, after Jennings was handcuffed and in the back of the cruiser, the woman who called police came outside to speak with officers at their request, the video shows. She told police she did know Jennings, that he lived close by and that she wouldn’t have been surprised if her neighbors had asked him to water their flowers while they were away.

“They are friends, and they went out of town today. He may be watering their flowers. It would be completely normal,” she said, adding “This is probably my fault.”

Jennings’s attorneys said that the body-cam footage revealed evidence that cleared “the way for legal action against the officers.”

“This video makes it clear that these officers decided they were going to arrest Pastor Jennings less than five minutes after pulling up and then tried to rewrite history claiming he hadn’t identified himself when that was the first thing he did,” Daniels said. “This was not only an unlawful arrest. It’s kidnapping. It’s irrational, irresponsible and illegal.”

Jennings told ABC News he’s considering filing a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the department. Regardless, he wants to do something that prevents someone else from going through what he has endured.",Q3
https://www.heritage.org/firearms/commentary/second-amendment-protects-everyone-12-examples-defensive-gun-use-show,"Second Amendment Protects Everyone, as 12 Examples of Defensive Gun Use Show","The Supreme Court last month struck down a New York law that effectively prohibited ordinary citizens from carrying handguns in public for self-defense.

As some New Yorkers joined gun control activists in decrying the decision as making them less safe, one young woman explained how, for her, the high court’s opinion meant she was one step closer to sleeping soundly for the first time in months.

Laura Adkins, a liberal journalist living in New York City, described how, after a recent breakup, her ex-partner’s increasingly obsessive and harassing behavior made her fear for her life despite the temporary order of protection she got.

For weeks, Adkins said, she slept with a sheathed hunting knife under her pillow, fully aware that it would offer little protection against a man twice her size, but knowing she had few other readily available options for defending herself given the city’s incredibly restrictive laws on handgun possession.

Despite her belief in gun control, Adkins came to understand that good policy is not just about preventing dangerous individuals from owning firearms. It also should “empower vulnerable citizens to protect themselves.”

Now, Adkins wants a gun. And she wants to carry it in public.

Adkins is not alone in this changed perspective. In the past two years, millions of Americans have bought a firearm for the first time, many for the same reasons as Adkins: They’ve come to understand that the right to keep and bear arms offers the most meaningful defense of their inalienable rights.

Almost every major study on the issue has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 500,000 and 3 million times annually, according to the most recent report on the subject by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For this reason, The Daily Signal each month publishes an article highlighting some of the previous month’s many news stories on defensive gun use that you may have missed—or that might not have made it to the national spotlight in the first place. (Read other accounts here from 2019, 2020, 2021, and so far in 2022.)

The examples below represent only a small portion of the news stories on defensive gun use that we found in June. You may explore more by using The Heritage Foundation’s interactive Defensive Gun Use Database. (The Daily Signal is the multimedia news organization of The Heritage Foundation.)

June 5, Memphis, Tennessee: A man exchanged gunfire with three apparent burglars whom he saw quickly get out of a vehicle and run toward his neighbor’s home. One was wounded in the shootout and the other two fled, and it doesn’t appear that the gun owner or his neighbor were injured. Police eventually arrested three suspects, who admitted they were breaking into cars in the neighborhood. They face charges of aggravated assault and property theft.

These stories underscore the reality that Adkins helps illustrate: The Second Amendment belongs to everyone, in every part of the country, facing any type of imminent threat to life, liberty, or property. And we don’t always know when our otherwise peaceful lives will be interrupted by serious danger.

The Second Amendment helps ensure that all potential victims—whether a 93-year-old widower in California defending his home, a father in rural Kentucky protecting his daughters, or a young woman in New York City afraid of her ex-partner—have not just the theoretical right but the practical ability to act in self-defense when faced with sudden threats.

To Adkins and every other New Yorker on the cusp of exercising your constitutional rights for the first time: Let us be the first to say, “Welcome.”

This year, the CL-415 ""super scoopers"" hit the ground running.

Last Thursday, the very first day of their contract, the big yellow planes helped tame the explosive Route Fire which burned north of Castaic.

One of the newest members of the Southern California's fleet of ""leased"" aircraft is the Heli-Tanker 55.

Along with the increasing fire threat comes the need for better tools. Firefighters are calling these aircraft a ""game changer"" and for one very important reason.

Flight engineer Heather Balint often flies in the Heli-Tanker 55 chopper that drops loads of water or retardant. She does this overnight in complete darkness with infrared goggles and specialized equipment.

""If we're doing 3,000 gallons, it could take up to 90 seconds,"" Balint said.

SoCal Edison spent $18 million for a Heli-Tanker 55 chopper and two other choppers like it.

""Edison estimates it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfire by 65 to 70%,"" said Larry Chung of SoCal Edison. ""All fire agencies without out footprint have these available to them.""

Kahlil Square, 27, pleaded guilty to a charge of first-degree murder last week, lawyer Tony Coleman said.

The plea is “blind,” meaning Square has no agreement with the district attorney’s office, Coleman said. He described the move as the “best strategy available to us.”

The Pontotoc County District Attorney's Office, which is prosecuting the case, could not immediately be reached for comment.

Kristie Evans, 49, was sentenced last month to life in prison with the possibility of parole in the March 22, 2021, murder of her husband of 30 years, David Evans, a pastor at Harmony Free Will Baptist Church in Ada.

Authorities have said Square shot David Evans while he was asleep at home. Kristie Evans initially said an intruder killed her husband but later admitted that she asked Square to do it.

In interviews from jail last year, she said her husband repeatedly pressured her to have sex with other men, including Square. She also described him as physically abusive and financially controlling.

During Kristie Evans' sentencing hearing, prosecutors described her as a ""very good liar"" who used Square.

Coleman echoed those comments Monday, saying she exploited a man who ""was just gullible enough to fall into her web of deception and manipulation.""

""She did a number on him,"" he said.

https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/sister-of-teen-charged-in-green-valley-ranch-arson-sentenced-in-drug-weapons-case,"Sister of teen charged in Green Valley Ranch arson sentenced in drug, weapons case","DENVER – The sister of one of the teenagers charged with murder and arson in the 2020 Green Valley Ranch fire that killed five was sentenced Friday morning to more than 10 years in prison after she pleaded guilty to federal firearm and drug distribution counts in February.

Tanya Bui pleaded guiltyin the U.S. District Court of Colorado in February to one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and one count of possession with intent to distribute a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of fentanyl.

On Friday, she was sentenced to five years in prison for the first count and 70 months (five years and 10 months) for the second count, according to court records and a Denver7 reporter who was in the courtroom. The sentences will run consecutively.

After she is released, she will be on supervised release for four years for the first count and three years for the second count – though those will run concurrently.

The court recommended she be imprisoned at a facility in or near the Norther District of California, which could records said was “commensurate with her security classification.”

“This defendant’s outrageous actions, including dealing drugs to juveniles, are worthy of a lengthy prison sentence,” U.S. Attorney Cole Finegan said in a statement. “We appreciate the diligent work of our partners at the ATF and the Denver Police Department.”

Bui is the older sister of Kevin Bui, who is one of three teenagers who was charged in the first that killed a Senegalese family in Green Valley Ranch in 2020.

Kevin Bui and Gavin Seymour face adult charged in the case while the other teen faces juvenile charges. Kevin Bui also picked up new charges last week after he was accused of possessing and distributing pills with suspected fentanyl in jail in Denver.

When police were investigating the arson and murder case, they discovered that Kevin Bui was helping Tanya Bui traffic drugs. They found communications with them detailing how Kevin would help Tanya distribute fentanyl pills and marijuana through social media and over the phone.

When investigators searched their home in Littleton, they found 74 grams of fentanyl pills and nearly 4,000 grams of marijuana, according to federal court filings. Investigators said Tanya Bui would tell Kevin whom to sell to, where to make deals, and generally directed him on how to help her.

As part of her plea deal, Tanya Bui agreed to forfeit a .45-caliber pistol, ammunition and $6,825. Prosecutors did not seek the maximum sentence in the case because of Bui’s cooperation and plea agreement.

Kevin Bui’s arraignment in the murder and arson case was continued to July 28 because of his drug arrest in June. He has a preliminary hearing set in the drug case for Aug. 8.",Q3
https://www.thecitizen.in/life/the-imitation-game-343806,The Imitation Game,"Laal Singh Chaddha gives rise to many fascinating speculations. When does a movie adaptation work? Who deserves praise or blame for a copycat movie? What value does Hollywood add to Bollywood? And can one enjoy Laal Singh Chaddha, without seeing Forrest Gump? A few days ago, Shoma Chatterji confirmed that Laal Singh Chaddha is just as enjoyable as a stand alone film, to a viewer who does not know Forrest Gump. Others, like me, who watched the original to prepare ourselves for the Bollywood version, revel in the delights of the imitation game.

Laal Singh Chaddha is a 'copycat' movie par excellence. With it, Amir Khan has become a full fledged member of the Bollywood club of imitators, which has over the years brazenly stolen the themes and tales, the sequences and tunes, even the swagger and stunts of Hollywood films and actors.

Amir Khan has, however, raised imitation to a new level, after making this copy with the permission and cooperation of the original producers and openly acknowledging the connection. The art lies in his adaptation of the episodes and even the frames of Forrest Gump to the Indian setting with brilliant plausibility.

Forrest Gump is a record of a period in American history reflected in the lives of a simpleminded young man and the girl he loves. Writers like Dosteovsky, Gunther Grass and Harper Lee have used outsiders like children, ""idiots"" and disabled persons to comment on political atrocities. In the same tradition, Forrest Gump sets the story of its hero against the backdrop of the major events of the time, events in which he is both observer and participant.

Laal Singh Chaddha successfully meets the challenge of adaptation by fitting the same episodes to the chronology of recent Indian history. It's a clever decision to make the hero a Sikh so that Amir Khan can weave into the tale the Khalistani movement, the storming of the Golden Temple and the assassination of Indira Gandhi and its aftermath. Other cataclysmic happenings of the country are also part of the political narrative, which closes with the India Against Corruption fast in New Delhi.

There are many clever touches while retelling the story. Forrest Gump corners person after person who wait at a bus stop so that he can tell them his tale. Laal Singh Chaddha improves on the original: the hero is in a Chandigarh bound train, capturing the attention of a group of travellers and the ticket collector with his gripping story. That's a familiar environment to every Indian and a perfect locale to connect with people from all over the country; there is always one person and often many who recognise and react to what he is saying.

Many of the adaptive touches are gently amusing. As the movie opened, I wondered what gift the hero would carry to the heroine. It was delightful to see Forrest Gump's chocolate box transmuted into gol gappe, with its links to Laal's mother and his girlfriend.

And, like most of Laal's audience, I laughed out loud when the passion of his friend in the army was revealed to be men's underwear, which captures the market only when it is rebranded as Rupa. This is a joke that only Indians can follow. Rupa is the name of a very popular brand of Indian men's underwear, it's also the name of Laal's girlfriend, making it the perfect fit for this episode of the story. Adaptations like these improve on the original and Indianise the movie marvellously.

Many scenes of the film are just as effective in the Hollywood and the Bollywood versions. Laal does not wade into the water before a monument as Gump does before the Washington memorial to rescue his girlfriend, but there are equally stunning shots of our capital city, like the sequence of the couple strolling down Rajpath together in front of India Gate at night.

Some liberties have been taken with the script too. Laal rescues a Pakistani infiltrator at Kargil, not his own commanding officer, as Forrest does. This plot is used by Amir Khan to hint at building bridges with our warring neighbour. The scene teeters on the brink of Bollywoodian melodrama, when the erstwhile spy whom Laal befriends watches the terrorist attack on the Taj Hotel, Mumbai in anguished silence.

On the whole, though, the political messages are muted as in Forrest Gump. There is no flag waving, no protest against or violent reaction to any of the terrible events that happen in the country. The simple Laal is always honest, talking of his achievements and foolishness with the same sincerity, even daring to tell the nation how bewildered and scared the soldiers at Kargil were.

He is the symbol of the innocent Indian at the mercy of everything thrown at him by the country's leaders, always picking himself up and stumbling on. It is only when he is cornered and defeated, that, like his counterpart Gump, he takes Rupa's advice and flees, running in fear and distress mile after mile till the pain is expiated and he is whole again.

Fellow citizens, caught in their own travails and looking for a leader, find redemption in his example and willingly join him. I can only marvel at the stupidity of those who have boycotted the film, when it has only held up a mirror to the sad and happy events that all Indians have lived through from the nin1980s.

The styles of Hollywood and Bollywood mingle well throughout the picture. Hollywoodian restraint prevents the tearjerker episodes from descending into bathos, while the Bollywood music plays on our emotions with a special sweetness. The verses of the theme song linger in the mind, evoking the philosophy and spirit of the movie. These are the additions which drag out a long story over an additional half hour.

Comparisons may be odious but they are unavoidable in a 'copycat' movie. Laal Singh Chaddha is just as engaging and will continue to be watched as much as Forrest Gump. The tale and its setting seem closer to our lives than the American version for this is what we have all seen and known. On the whole though, I prefer Tom Hanks to Amir Khan, Katrina Kaif to Jenny Wright and the junior Laal to the boy Forrest. I shall return to the movie, as I do to Lagaan, my other Amir Khan favourite.

As for the imitation, Amir Khan might just have started a fresh trend in moviemaking. He has discovered immense possibilities in Forrest Gump; surely it can be transposed to other countries and backgrounds too. An Egyptian, Pakistani or Sri Lankan Gump seem possible and even necessary, when we remember what ordinary citizens of these countries have felt and suffered in recent years. I look forward to seeing them soon.",Q3
https://www.dawn.com/news/1704039/4-soldiers-martyred-in-north-waziristan-suicide-attack-ispr,4 soldiers martyred in North Waziristan suicide attack: ISPR,"Four soldiers were martyred in a suicide blast at a military convoy in the Mir Ali area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's North Waziristan district, the military's media affairs wing said on Tuesday.

The martyred soldiers have been identified as 22-year-old Lance Naik Shahzaib, a resident of Mansehra, 26-year-old Lance Naik Sajjad, hailing from Ghizer, 25-year-old sepoy Umair, a resident of Kohat and 30-year-old sepoy Khurram, a resident of Narowal.

According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), intelligence agencies have commenced investigations to find out details about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack and his handlers and facilitators.

The ""Pakistan Army is determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers will not go unpunished,"" the ISPR said.

President Dr Arif Alvi has condemned the attack and expressed grief over the martyrdom of Pakistan Army soldiers.

Tweets by the president's office quoted him as saying that ""such cowardly attacks cannot weaken our resolve to rid the country of the scourge of terrorism and all its manifestations"".

He paid tributes to the martyred soldiers for laying down their lives while defending the country and extended condolences to their families.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the incident, saying that the entire nation was sad at the soldiers' martyrdom.

https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/07/22/ysjz-j22.html,Unsealed testimony confirms judicial misconduct in filmmaker Roman Polanski’s 1977 criminal case,"A transcript of a 2010 closed hearing unsealed Sunday night supports the claims of Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski that a judge was going to renege on a sentencing agreement in 1977. Threatened with being thrown in jail for years, or even decades, Polanski fled the US.

Retired Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson, who prosecuted Polanski in 1977, testified in 2010 that he was so concerned about the handling of the sexual assault case by Judge Laurence Rittenband that he drafted a document seeking the latter’s removal. Gunson’s sealed testimony was ordered released by a California Appellate Court last Wednesday after Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón dropped the longstanding objections of his predecessors.

In 1977, Polanski pled guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a teenage girl and was sent to California’s Chino state prison for a 90-day diagnostic evaluation, with the understanding that this would be the extent of his incarceration. The diagnostic study recommended probation.

Gunson’s testimony provides further details about Rittenband’s misconduct. According to Deadline, Gunson’s 20-page affidavit seeking recusal of the judge followed concerns that Rittenband was seeking information and opinions from “all over the place”—including people not directly involved, such as friends, media and prosecutor David Wells, who had no official role in the proceedings. Gunson’s request that Rittenband be disqualified from the case was denied by his superiors in the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office.

Gunson testified, Variety reports, “that Rittenband said he would ‘recall’ Polanski after he had completed the full 90 days [in Chino], but it was not clear if Polanski could rely on that promise. ‘If he were sent to state prison and not recalled by the judge, then he could be there for 20 or 50 years,’” said Gunson. He further explained that Rittenband “had promised him [Polanski] on two occasions ... something that he reneged on. So it wasn’t surprising to me that, when he [Polanski] was told he was going to be sent off to state prison ... that he could not or would not trust the judge.”

Because of the film director’s history and lack of criminal background, as well as medical evaluations his attorney had previously submitted, a probation recommendation was considered highly likely.

It had been further agreed that if the diagnostic evaluation recommended probation, such a recommendation would be accepted by the judge, prosecutor and Polanski. The victim, Samantha (née Gailey) Geimer, and her family also agreed to this disposition.

It took 42 days for prison evaluators in Chino to determine Polanski was amenable for probation and he was released. As the filmmaker’s sentencing date approached, the state prison evaluators and the Los Angeles County Probation Department both submitted reports recommending probation.

The day before Polanski was to appear for his sentencing, his lawyers were informed that Rittenband had reneged on the agreement for probation and instead would be sentencing Polanski to prison.

Upon being informed of this, Polanski immediately boarded a flight to Europe. After the filmmaker failed to appear at his scheduled sentencing, Rittenband issued a warrant for Polanski.

At the time of his arrest in March 1977, Polanski was a renowned filmmaker who had directed many acclaimed works, including Knife in the Water (1962), Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-sac (1966), Rosemary’s Baby (1968), Macbeth (1971), Chinatown (1974) and The Tenant (1976).

Polanski was also well known as a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust. As a child in Poland in 1942-43, he witnessed the deportation of Krakow’s Jewish population to concentration camps and barely escaped that fate himself. His father survived a camp, but his mother died in Auschwitz.

In 1969, Polanski’s wife, actress Sharon Tate, eight months pregnant, was murdered along with four other people at the couple’s home in Los Angeles by members of the Charles Manson “family” (Polanski was in Europe at the time).

Since his flight from the US in 1977, Polanski has lived and worked in Europe, primarily France. His film The Pianist, about a Jewish musician surviving in Nazi-occupied Poland won three Academy Awards in 2003 (best actor, director and adapted screenplay) and was nominated for four others. Polanski was unable to attend the Academy Awards ceremony because of the still outstanding 25-year-old warrant for his arrest.

The new interest in Polanski’s legal ordeal motivated the making of an in-depth documentary on his case in 2008, Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired (Marina Zenovich). This film for the first time revealed what caused Rittenband, who died in 1993, to renege on the previously agreed to disposition of the case.

One of the interviewees in the film was David Wells, who had been a Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney and who in 1977-78 had been assigned to Rittenband’s court. Although Wells was not directly involved with the Polanski prosecution, he had access to Rittenband, and took credit for privately encouraging Rittenband to repudiate Polanski’s plea agreement. Wells explained that he repeatedly told Rittenband that Polanski needed to be sent to prison.

In the just released 2010 transcript, Gunson named Wells as one of the individuals who had been engaged in unethical conduct along with Rittenband.

What Wells described was egregious judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. A judge cannot discuss a case without both parties being present and cannot consider evidence outside of what has been presented in court.

In 2009, in response in part to the documentary, Polanski’s lawyers moved to have the matter dismissed on the grounds of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. Their requests at both the trial level and appellate level were denied. On each occasion, however, the courts conceded there was strong evidence of misconduct, but could not rule without Polanski being present.

The Los Angeles District Attorney’s office then for the first time initiated extradition proceedings against Polanski, which culminated in his arrest in September 2009 in Switzerland.

The filmmaker was jailed for two months and then put under house arrest at his home in Switzerland while awaiting a decision on appeals fighting his extradition. In July 2010, a Swiss court, the first court to actually rule on the merits of Polanski’s claims, rejected the US request, relying on evidence of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct and declared Polanski a “free man” and released him from custody. In 2015, the US issued an extradition request to Poland, which was also ultimately rejected.

The vindictive campaign against the 88-year-old filmmaker has always been politically motivated, aimed at whipping up the most backward elements of the population. The victim in the case, Samantha Geimer, long ago repudiated the campaign against Polanski. Her conduct stands in contrast to the hypocritical and reactionary claims of the media and US government authorities, who have no difficulty with war criminals walking the streets of Washington and elsewhere with impunity. In recent years, the anti-Polanski hysteria has been nourished by the #MeToo sexual witch-hunt and the Democratic Party’s need to satisfy its upper-middle-class base.

One of the most pernicious consequences of the vendetta has been the blacklisting in the US of Polanski’s critically acclaimed film J’accuse (An Officer and a Spy, 2019) about the infamous Dreyfus affair. The film depicts the 12-year struggle to clear Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jewish officer falsely convicted of spying for Germany in 1894. France came to the brink of civil war between defenders of Dreyfus, led by Jean Jaurès and the socialist workers movement, and the antidreyfusards—the Army general staff, the Church and the anti-Semitic Action française led by Charles Maurras. Dreyfus was ultimately cleared and the conspiracy to frame him definitively repudiated in 1906.

A WSWS review argued that the film “genuinely and artistically illuminates one of the great events of European history” and was “an immense achievement.” J’accuse has the most burning relevance in the light of one of the great frame-ups of our time, the persecution of Julian Assange, and the growth of fascistic and anti-Semitic tendencies, in Europe and the US.

But, thanks to the #MeToo witch-hunters, backed by the extreme right, American audiences have been denied the right to see and be educated by Polanski’s film. In France, where J’accuse was one of the most widely seen films of the year, it was nominated for 12 César awards in 2020, the country’s highest film honors. It won three awards, including best director and best adapted screenplay for Polanski.

When the César nominations were announced, the Macron government, seizing upon the scandal to promote censorship and build an affluent middle-class base for its repressive policies, joined with the #MeToo campaign in condemning the nominations.

César President Alain Terzian dismissed the objections by stating, “The César awards are not an institution that must have moral positions. Unless I am wrong, 1.5 million French people went to see this film. Ask them.” Polanski was unable to attend the awards ceremony because of numerous threats.

As to Polanski’s lingering 1978 “fugitive” status, defense lawyer Harland Braun explained in expectation of the sealed transcript’s formal release that he would renew his effort to have Polanski sentenced in absentia, which would end his status as a fugitive from justice in the US.",Q3

The measures and conviction were finalized Friday against Christopher Ambrosio, who resigned weeks after his March 24 2021 arrest on charges of lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim 12 to 16 years old and contributing to the delinquency of a child, received five years of probation and sex offender conditions, the State Attorney's Office said. The sex charge was refiled on Aug. 30 as third-degree felony child abuse, while the delinquency charge was dropped.

""The victim and law enforcement were both in agreement with the outcome,"" State Attorney's Office spokesman David Chapman said. Ambrosio could have received up to five years in prison.

The conditions against Ambrosio, 51, include no contact with the victim or other minors, therapy and submitting his DNA sample to law enforcement. His name will not be placed on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's child sex offender list, prosecutors said.

Inappropriate actions go too far

His Atlantic Beach arrest report indicates he was a friend of the victim's family, visited her home and had ""hung out"" with her alone on several occasions. In a Feb. 19 text exchange with Ambrosio, the girl was invited for ""a sleepover,"" the report said.

The two went to a gym about a month before his arrest, then got some alcoholic beverages before going to his Seminole Road home, the report said. When the girl took a bath, the suspect said to keep the door unlocked. She felt uneasy and put on a bathing suit before getting into the bathtub.

The girl was given an alcoholic beverage while in the bathtub, but did not drink it, the report said. Ambrosio sat on the toilet and spoke with her before she got uneasy and stepped out of the tub. He told her to try on another bathing suit so he could see it. She thought it was an odd request but changed, and went back in the bathroom to find the lights turned off and Ambrosio naked, the report said.

""Ambrosio had gotten into the bathtub and was attempting to pull down the victim's bathing suit bottom,"" the report said. ""[Redacted] kept pulling them back up, and he continued to try to pull them off.""

The bathing suit was ultimately pulled off, and Ambrosio touched the victim for a few seconds before she fled into a bedroom""?

for a few seconds before she fled into a bedroom, locking the door and texting a parent to get her, the report said. The victim left, telling Ambrosio she was feeling ill.

The next day Ambrosio texted the girl, saying he hoped she was feeling better.

The girl did not contact him, the report said. But someone else and ""a mutual friend"" did question Ambrosio about what occurred, although he denied anything inappropriate happened, the report said.

A family member or friend confronted Ambrosio again, threatening to go to the police. Ambrosio said he would go and spoke with investigators, identifying himself as Jacksonville Beach's city attorney and knowing ""lots of police,"" the report said.

The investigation was passed to the Atlantic Beach Police Department, who made the arrest.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/tulsa-school-board-emphasizes-academic-excellence-facing-criticism-social-media-meme,Tulsa school board member emphasizes academic excellence after facing criticism over social media meme,"A Tulsa, Okla., school board member came under fire for a social media post critics believed was homophobic and inappropriate, but she said the focus of the meme, and her run for school board, was academic excellence.

E’Lena Ashley, who was elected to the school board in April, was criticized for a post she shared on social media which compared ""what third grade children"" are learning in China, India and the United States. The meme depicted the children in China and India learning complex math and science, while third-graders in the United States were learning about gender.

""How can we compete,"" wrote Ashley in her post.

Comments on the post called it ""hateful bigotry"" and ""inappropriate,"" and critics began calling for Ashley to take diversity and inclusion trainings.

Ashley told Fox News Digital the meme was meant to illustrate the importance of ""academic excellence.""

MOMS SOUND ALARM ABOUT TEACHERS' UNIONS, LEARNING LOSS: ‘WE NEED TO TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND’

""We need academic excellence in America, and as the meme was obviously stating, other countries prioritize academic excellence, while America, having full capability to do so, seems to have not done that,"" Ashley said. ""So we need to turn our priorities to our children.""

Following Ashley’s posting of the meme, the Tulsa County Democratic Party encouraged the public to attend the next school board meeting, wearing pride colors.

""Help support the demand for school board members to have LGBTQ Inclusion training. And to keep equality and inclusion in public schools,"" one woman wrote on Facebook.

TEACHERS UNIONS HAVE TAKEN OVER GOVERNMENT EDUCATION: MOTHER OF THREE

At the school board meeting, members of the public spoke out about, without directly naming Ashley, about the need for inclusion in schools, and the harm of social media.

""I encourage each board member to spend some time at schools and get to know the children and teachers there so you can see for yourself their intelligence, their spark, and their potential,"" one member of the public said, while criticizing the divisiveness of posting on social media.

""I’m here to ask this entire body of elected leaders to engage in learning to better serve students and families,"" another commenter said. ""This has become divisive unnecessarily. There is nothing extreme about deciding to engage in learning, especially about identities and beliefs different from one’s own.""

Ashley said the school board meeting was a ""platform for them to speak and give their ideas,"" and added that she believes ""all people should be respected and heard.""

Following Ashley’s Facebook post, the Oklahoma Secretary of Education released a statement in support of Ashley.

""It would be unacceptable for the Tulsa School Board to require or even entertain this type of targeting of a duly elected school board member.""

Ashley said she initially ran for the school board because she noticed a decline in academic standards.

""I ran because I noticed in my community, and in several places, our students were not doing well academically,"" she said. ""As I looked in to it, I found that our grades were failing, and it’s been a continual failing for over 10 years here in Oklahoma, and probably in several other states, and I wanted to make a difference.""

https://www.theamericanconservative.com/guns-dont-kill-shinzo-abe/,Guns Don’t Kill Shinzo Abe,"Our friends on the left like to remind us that, “When the Founding Fathers talked about the right to bear arms, they meant Brown Bess muskets—not AR-15s.” And speaking as a certified gun nut, they have a point.

We have no idea what the Founders would have said about high-capacity magazines. Modern rifles can carry up to 100 rounds. Meanwhile, just 450 Americans died at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The men who drafted the Second Amendment couldn’t have imagined having the power to kill at this scale.

Advertisement

Yet here’s the thing. Opponents of gun control don’t say that high-capacity magazines are a great blessing to the human race. We say, “If you make guns illegal, only criminals will have guns.” The Bad Guys are going to get their hands on these weapons, whether we like it or not. The question is whether the Good Guys will be able to defend themselves.

Advances in technology mean we have to rethink the laws around that technology.

That is perfectly fair. But what if laws aren’t strong enough? What if the government can’t contain the harmful effects of new technology? And so-called “assault” rifles are only the beginning. Today, we also have to reckon with the homemade firearm.

On July 8, former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe was shot and killed at a political rally. His assassin, Tetsuya Yamagami, fits the profile of an American mass shooter. He’s a loner from a troubled family with no ambition in life. But there is a key difference. American shooters usually get their guns from their parents or buy them from a gun fair. In Japan, handguns are totally illegal. So, Mr. Yamagami made his own.

Homemade handguns are virtually impossible to regulate. The weapon used to kill Mr. Abe was built with a lithium battery, a couple of pipes, a block of wood, and some duct tape. Even in the United States, where factory-made handguns are widely available, gun enthusiasts are using 3D printers to fabricate their own. They just like them. It’s part of the DIY trend, like baking your own sourdough or brewing your own beer.

For those who don’t know, 3D printers are like the Replicators from Star Trek. They can be used to make everything from pizza to prosthetic limbs. Some companies now use them to create “3D selfies”: personalized statuettes, like the figurines you put on top of wedding cakes. They have the potential to improve the lot of our fellow man. They also seem like a lot of fun.

This leaves our governments in a real pickle. Do they make 3D printers illegal in order to prevent 3D-printed gun crimes? Or do they let the people decide how they’ll use this technology and punish those who misuse it?

Of course, there is a third option. They could pass laws making it illegal to fabricate weapons using 3D printers. Yet this would be a purely symbolic gesture. It wouldn’t prevent crime; it will only allow district attorneys to tack on extra charges once a major felony has been committed. Mr. Yamagami will have to serve five years for possession of an illegal firearm on top of his life sentence for first-degree murder.

American law will definitely choose option three. We always do. On the one hand, we refuse to hinder the progress of Science. (Imagine what future historians would say about us. “Luddites!” “Reactionaries!”) On the other, we don’t trust our countrymen to use the blessings of Science responsibly. So, we split the baby. We make life difficult for law-abiding citizens while basically doing nothing to prevent criminals from plying their trade.

And as these technologies become more advanced, even our nominal attempts at regulation become more and more absurd. After every mass shooting, our liberal friends insist, “We have to do something!”—or, better yet, “We can’t do nothing!” But what if there’s nothing we can do?

This is the prevailing mood of the modern world: a feeling of total helplessness, which we try to allay through lots of useless activity.

It all began with the invention of the atom bomb. Except for a few American generals and Nazi scientists, nobody on the planet actually wanted the A-bomb. We didn’t give our government permission to build it. We didn’t give them permission to use it, either. We’ve carried our guilt over Hiroshima and Nagasaki for eighty years. We lived in the bomb’s long shadow during the Cold War. Even today, when North Korea rattles its saber or Russia invades one of its neighbors, our thoughts turn to nuclear holocaust.

Man invented the bomb. Yet even in its cradle it was the bomb that called the shots.

Or take a more mundane example: smartphones. According to a recent poll, over half of Americans say they use their smartphone too much. You hear people say all the time, “I hate this stupid phone. I wish I could just ditch it.” So why don’t you? “Well, I need the Gmail app for work. And I have my whole life on my calendar. And I don’t want to lug around a dumbphone and a digital camera and a GPS…”

In 2011, just 35 percent of Americans had smartphones. That number is up to 85 percent today. In a single decade, life without them has become literally unimaginable. Nobody asked for it. It wasn’t invented to solve a particular problem. It didn’t fill an absence in our lives. (Just the opposite.) Yet as soon as the iPhone appeared on the market, we all had to have it.

We don’t own this technology. The technology owns us.

That helplessness is an illusion, though. It’s sort of like a comfort blanket. It allows us to outsource our moral choices—usually to the government. And if that worked, I would be all for it! Believe me, I’m no libertarian.

The trouble is that it doesn’t work. Our lefty friends are right. We have to do something—not Joe Biden, or Nancy Pelosi, or Mitch McConnell, but you and me.

Because this moral outsourcing is part of the problem. It weakens our resistance. If we could pass a law tomorrow banning Americans from owning smartphones, they’d just find something else to be addicted to. And if men like Mr. Yamagami want to take a life, they’ll find a way.

We don’t need better laws. We need better men. We need to be more discerning about which technologies we adopt—and, once we adopt them, we need to exercise more self-control in using them.

That seems obvious, because it is. And yet we never hear anyone say it. Why? Because it would mean dispelling our comforting illusions. It would force us to own our decisions. But the longer we tolerate this moral atrophy, the harder it will be to grow strong again.

“Man is born free,” said Rousseau, “and everywhere he is in chains.” Really, that’s just wishful thinking. Man wraps himself in chains, the way a child wraps himself in his special blanket. It comforts him. It gives him the pleasant illusion of unfreedom.

The truth is that man is free, whether he likes it or not. Until we can wrap our heads around that beautiful, horrible reality, nothing will get better. Nothing at all.",Q3

At about 2:25 a.m. Pasadena police tried to pull over a white van involved in an armed carjacking, according to authorities.

The driver of the van did not stop and led police on a chase which ended on North Lake Ave. in Pasadena.

At times the driver was seen driving down the wrong side of the road. A witness of the pursuit said it lasted about 30 minutes.

The driver appeared to be armed with a gun and after ignoring multiple police commands, officers fired at him.

Police have not released any information regarding the man's identity.

No officers were injured in the incident and no one else was in the van other than the driver.

The driver might have also been connected to an earlier crash involving a sheriff's deputy in Rosemead.

Deputies in South El Monte spotted a stolen vehicle at about 1:50 a.m. in the area of Rosemead Boulevard and Garvey Avenue, which triggered a four-minute pursuit that ended on the northbound San Gabriel River (605) Freeway at the San Bernardino (10) Freeway in Baldwin Park, according to a watch commander at the LA County Sheriff's Department's Temple station.

A deputy in a patrol vehicle, en route to assist in the pursuit, was involved in a two-vehicle crash at Rosemead Blvd. and Glendon Way in Rosemead. The deputy suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital, where he was expected to be released sometime Saturday.

The motorist in the other vehicle suffered minor injuries and was not hospitalized.

The watch commander at the sheriff's Temple station referred all inquiries to the Pasadena Police Department when asked if the suspect in South El Monte was the same man who was shot dead at the end of the pursuit in Pasadena.

This incident is still being investigated.

Over 600 children and nearly 2,000 teenagers killed or injured as a result of gun violence in 2022 alone. Polarizing rhetoric. Economic fallout.

These are some of the reasons for an uptick in anxiety, depression and other behavioral health conditions among K-12 students, according to Wisconsin-based pediatrics professionals.

""This is yet another school year that's starting off a little rocky because we're still looking for the new normal,"" Linda Hall, director of the Wisconsin Office of Children's Mental Health, said. ""The disruptions kids experienced when they were doing partially or completely virtual school … have not been healed yet.""

Establishing strong foundations when the goalpost continues to shift has created a unique set of challenges since the pandemic upended everyday life. That struggle is especially accentuated for children and teenagers across the country. According to the 2022 Kids Count Data Book from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which looks at state trends in children's well-being, anxiety and depression are on the rise among Wisconsin's youth. This is especially true for young people of color.

As parents, students and educators prepare for the coming school year, it's tempting to minimize the importance of mental health in the hustle of back-to-school shopping, but mental health experts say starting the year with a stronger understanding of emotional well-being will ultimately improve the quality of life for students — and parents, too.

Marcia Slattery, professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of UW Anxiety Disorders Program, described the general anxieties of returning to school, which run the gamut of uncertainties from going into a new grade, having a new teacher and new peers and undergoing a harder course load.

Slattery said these unknowns generate ""negative expectations and negative worries,"" which are common. But COVID-19 has made each subsequent return to school distinct, and the residual effects of the years of isolation continue their toll on students' developing skills.

Meanwhile, as schools continue to feel the effects of staffing shortages, students are experiencing losses where they hadn't expected them before, said Julie Incitti, the school social work consultant with Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. That can look like a student's favorite club no longer having an advisor or a larger classroom size leading to less individual attention, Incitti said.

Another distressing unknown, Slattery said, comes from the escalating mass shooting events in the United States. Worry over becoming a victim of gun violence is further enforced by lockdown drills and code black — the act of locking the door, turning the lights off and hiding.

""When you think about COVID and school shootings, they're random, especially the shootings, and you can't do anything to prepare,"" Slattery said. ""They're so random and so potentially catastrophic. They're having to learn very different skills relative to what adults had to when we were in grade school and high school.""

Although the challenges are great, here are some ways to enhance and fortify students' mental well-being in the coming school year.

Communicating the unknowns

One consequence of the pandemic, Slattery has observed, is that children and young adults feel increasingly inadequate next to their peers. Depressive thoughts eke their way in as kids ask themselves whether others will like them and if they can even connect to somebody in as big of a place as a school setting.

In other words, two years of being socially disconnected, Slattery said, has shrunk their confidence.

""That, to me, is one of the more common reasons why kids have been feeling more sad and more down. It's as if they're still alone,"" Slattery said. ""They don't feel good enough compared to other kids and they just feel very uncomfortable trying to figure out how to fit in.""

Isolation leads to more isolation, Slattery said, because it comes with negative thoughts and negative expectations, a combination that can often snowball.

Throughout the pandemic, the Wisconsin Office of Children's Mental Health ran a series of listening sessions with young people to better ascertain their needs. By and large, students wrote that they wished more adults had ""comfortable, simple conversations with them"" during the school day, Hall said.

Much work has been done around alcohol and drug awareness through Wisconsin Department of Health's Small Talks initiative, Hall said. She emphasized the same can be done to promote mental health awareness.

""They'd like to be able to just talk to a teacher, maybe another staff member, and have multiple people at school that they feel they can comfortably talk to about (mental health),"" Hall said.

Parents and guardians can serve as active listeners, and these conversations can happen on a routine basis. Slattery recommended establishing a time to ""talk less and listen more,"" whether that means in the car, near bedtime or before homework.

Consistency here is important, Slattery said, ""otherwise it feels awkward and abnormal for them.""

Incitti, from DPI, suggested parents ask their children open-ended questions and to communicate with school mental health professionals or their child's primary care physicians if they're concerned about their child's behaviors.

Incitti advised against waiting until behaviors are critical before communicating to a mental health professional, due to the long waiting list to enroll students in school-based counseling.

""It can take three months to get connected to a community mental health professional, so it's important for students or for parents to recognize what the warning signs of mental health challenges look like,"" Incitti said.

Building routines around the knowns and problem solving the unknowns

Between the pandemic, mass shootings and the heaviness of the news cycle, predictability has been thrown for a loop. Its part of why establishing routine can be so important, Slattery said.

""Having predictability helps the brain calm because there's a sense of mastery in being prepared,"" Slattery said.

This can look like, but is not limited to, setting up specific times for eating meals, participating in extracurriculars, doing homework and getting ready for bed.

Hall suggested parents sit down with their child and look through the extracurricular activities that might be appealing to them. Research from the Wisconsin Office of Children's Mental Health suggests that cultivating positive relationships through activities can offset the risk of mental health concerns.

""Being involved in extracurricular activities makes a difference in anxiety and depression. It doesn't have to be sports. It can be all kinds of things,"" Hall said.

A good night's sleep is of singular importance to mental health and executive functions, experts say, and an established set of routines can help nurture this crucial restorative time.

Routine can also help with problem-solving, Slattery said. One way she works with parents and children is to take a blank sheet of paper, fold it down the middle, and write down the child's worries on one side and solutions to that worry on the other.

""It makes them think more rationally about: how I could solve this, who I could go to, what things might help,"" Slattery said. ""And they can look at that and continue to have it in the room or review it ahead of time so that they're feeling like 'I've got a plan. I'm ready.'""

Accepting and celebrating children

Chief among the concerns students are bringing up with counselors is a lack of understanding, Incitti said, whether that sense of alienation is due to having a marginalized identity, struggling with basic needs or experiencing loss and grief.

""There's so many different reasons why students would come for extra help,"" Incitti said,

Hall said the Wisconsin Office of Children's Mental Health is working with around 200 people from networks across the state to address barriers to accessing mental health so that more students from every walk of life can get the care they need to thrive throughout the school year.

Of the barriers most concerning to Hall, she says that the wait time to see a counselor can take six weeks or longer for students, and just because a student gets an appointment, that counselor may not have the cultural competence to work with them.

Additionally, some kids don't have health insurance or, if they do through their parents' insurance, high deductibles make it all the more cumbersome to get mental health care.

But much like the blank sheet of paper folded down the middle, where worries exist, ideas can be generated on the other side.

Peer-led groups, such as Sources of Strength, can give kids the tools they need to thrive through frank and open conversations.

And across Wisconsin, students can find youth mental health groups where they can learn about existing program models and, potentially, initiate a youth mental health group of their own.

But some of the work can begin at home.

In students who identify as LGBTQ, Incitti said, the presence of an accepting parent can reduce suicide attempts by 40%. And in trans youth, she said, ignoring a child's requested pronouns and names can make them twice as likely to attempt suicide.

RELATED:Green Bay diocese schools ban use of pronouns, clothing, bathrooms that don't conform to sex assigned at birth

Normalizing feelings like anxiety, Slattery said, can be very powerful, too, especially if it's followed with mental health literacy.

""When we're anxious, we try to push it away. But if, instead we say it's OK to feel anxious and here are things we can do when the anxiety does come up, that's important for us to teach, too,"" Slattery said.

REEVES COUNTY, Texas — TxDOT is warning drivers in the Permian Basin about traffic alerts caused by crashes involving semi-trucks in Midland County and Reeves County.

Traffic on US 285 in Reeves County is being rerouted Tuesday afternoon after TxDOT says a pedestrian was hit by a semi-truck.

Southbound traffic was being rerouted through SH 302. Northbound traffic was being rerouted through CR 434.

According to the Reeves County Sheriff's Office Facebook page, the pedestrian was killed in the cash. The identity has not been released at this time.

As of 3:30 p.m., the sheriff's office says the road is reopened and traffic will continue as normal, though the investigation is still underway.

In Midland County, TxDOT says a semi-truck hauling an oil field tank took out a power line on SH 158 south of I-20.

Because the power lines were across all five lanes, southbound traffic was shut down and Midland PD was turning northbound traffic back to County Road 1150 to FM 307.",Q3

Tens of thousands of workers at banks, insurers and investment firms headed home as Tampa, a metro area of 3.2 million people, prepared for the wrath of Hurricane Ian. Companies including JPMorgan Chase, MetLife, Fisher Investments, Raymond James Financial and USAA, closed offices or asked employees to work remotely if possible.

Local officials expect more than 300,000 people to evacuate areas close to Tampa Bay, which, forecasters say, could be slammed by a storm surge of five to 10 feet. Many more firms closed voluntarily as Ian threatened to strike the area as soon as late Wednesday with winds up to 140 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

“The impacts are going to be far, far broader than just where the eye of the storm happens to make landfall,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a briefing Tuesday. “In some areas there will be catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge.”

Ian could still change course, sparing Tampa, but the city was taking no chances.

“My biggest concern is how big is this going to be,” said Steve Morey, senior vice president of economic development at the Tampa Bay Economic Development Council. “We’ve never seen one like this.”

Yet Tampa has undergone an expansion in its own right, luring tens of thousands of jobs in fields like banking, investment management and insurance.

In the past five years, the finance and professional service industry has grown by 13 percent, or 40,000 jobs, in the Tampa area and now employs 344,000 people, according to the Tampa Bay Economic Development Council.

JPMorgan Chase, which has almost 6,000 employees across the Tampa region, sent workers home. Raymond James, which is based in St. Petersburg, near Tampa, will close its offices Wednesday, sending 5,200 workers home. Insurer MetLife Inc. urged its 1,000 employees in Tampa to work from home if possible.

Insurer USAA closed its offices to allow its workers to prepare for the storm, as did Fisher Investments, which sent about 700 employees home.

Citigroup, which operates a sprawling campus in Tampa with roughly 8,400 workers, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Cathie Wood’s Ark Investments and Raymond James Financial, both headquartered in St. Petersburg, couldn’t be reached for comment.

Millions across the Tampa-St. Petersburg area rushed to prepare for the storm. The evacuation order covered coastal swaths of three counties around Tampa and St. Petersburg – Pinellas, Hillsborough and Pasco. Schools and courts were ordered closed until at least Thursday, while St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport will shut down at 1 p.m. Tuesday, officials said.

Cars backed up for blocks as residents waited to fill free sandbags offered at city depots, leading officials to turn people away. Supermarkets were packed with shoppers looking for bottled water, batteries and canned food, and there were reports that some stores had run out of bottled water or were limiting purchases. And many motorists rushed to gas stations to top off their vehicles as the region braced for a storm that could be the worst to hit the city in 101 years, according to Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research.

Several storms have come close to Tampa, including Elsa last year and Irma in 2017, but the last devastating storm to hit Tampa-St. Petersburg was in 1921.

“Things are kind of wild in Tampa, and most people are in a panic mode,” said Trudy Azarsepandan, 42, a lawyer who, like most people, had to take her work home on Monday after her firm’s office closed. On Tuesday morning, she and her husband took their 10-year-old son by car to Atlanta to seek refuge with friends after it became clear that Ian will slam into the city.

Azarsepandan, 42, grew up in Miami, and witnessed the devastation of Hurricane Andrew as a child, and said she has no desire to ride out a storm like Ian.

“It’s such a monster storm,” she said.

Diesel fuel demand to run generators soared more than 10-fold, mostly in Tampa, said Eliot Vancil, president of Fuel Logic, a distributor in the state. Statewide, nursing homes, supermarkets and hospitals are seeking fuel, but most of the demand is in and around Tampa, he said. There is no shortage of fuel but “there is a shortage of time to get it done” before Ian hits, he said.",Q3

Nikki Haley, left, and Vivek Ramaswamy are seen during the Republican primary presidential debate, Sept. 27, 2023, in Simi Valley, Calif.

It started with a short clip of him dancing with social media influencer Jake Paul and what Vivek Ramaswamy called a vision to better engage with younger voters.

It's continued with him documenting his travels on the campaign trail, showing time spent with his two young sons and responding to commenters.

However, the GOP presidential candidate's presence on the popular app TikTok has put a spotlight on his past business dealings and comments, drawing criticism from his rivals about his lack of political experience, as leaders on both sides of the aisle grapple with how or whether to use TikTok because of its links to the Chinese government.

On the GOP debate stage in Simi Valley, California, Wednesday night, Ramaswamy's TikTok presence was the target of aggressive attacks from his primary rivals, including Nikki Haley, who cut off Ramaswamy to shout, ""We can't trust you with TikTok,"" as he tried to explain the importance of reaching the younger generation in order to win the general election.

""TikTok is one of the most dangerous social media apps that we could have,"" Haley cut in, ""... Honestly, every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.""

It was a full-on attack from Haley who had previously said Ramaswamy's ""combination of honesty, intellect, and foresight are exactly what we need to overcome our challenges in the years ahead"" in her review of his first book, ""Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.""

Continuing to talk over Ramaswamy as he attempted to defend himself, Haley took another shot: ""When you were in business with the Chinese ... we can't trust you with TikTok""

Later in the debate, Haley again attacked Ramaswamy when he spoke out against providing military support for Ukraine, saying: ""A win for Russia is a win for China. But I forgot you like China.""

Haley was referring to Ramaswamy's company, Roivant Sciences, which has subsidiaries in China and has previously partnered with a private-equity arm of a state-owned investment company there. Sen. Tim Scott also took a swipe at Ramaswamy's business dealings in China on the debate stage Wednesday night, comparing it to the scrutiny President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden is under for his alleged business dealings in China.

However, it's not just Haley. Ramaswamy's TikTok debut comes as most GOP candidates have proposed banning the app or enacting similar safety features, citing national security risks at the hands of the Chinese-owned technology company ByteDance that controls the app.

Scott has pushed legislation that would require app stores to list an app's country of origin ""so that parents can make better choices,"" he's said, while former Vice President Mike Pence has been a vocal proponent of banning TikTok altogether. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson last year banned TikTok on state-owned devices, saying he does not want China accessing state data. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, too, when asked if he would ban the app as president, said ""I think so.""

Concern about TikTok's digital footprint is also leading to bipartisan efforts in Congress and by the White House to limit its reach. President Joe Biden's administration, which has prohibited the app from being downloaded on federal employees' work devices, has also threatened a national ban if the Beijing-based corporation doesn't divest.

Ramaswamy has also shared his own criticisms of the app, maintaining that children 16 and under ""should not be using addictive social media.""

Still, Ramaswamy, who has swarmed early states with campaign events, joined TikTok earlier this month, gaining tens of thousands of followers, but also sparking parody accounts and trolls, and forcing him to defend his flip-flop on the widely popular social media app he's previously called ""digital fentanyl.""

The comments are part of his hard line proposing ""decoupling"" from China, a country he believes the U.S. relies on too heavily.

""Because you know what he's thinking, he's looking back at me and he's saying, 'Okay. You don't have it in you because you're addicted to me. You're addicted to the fentanyl that I'm pumping across your southern border. You're addicted to the digital fentanyl that I'm putting in your kid's hands in the form of modern social media,'"" Ramaswamy said to voters in August, weeks before posting his first TikTok after a convincing conversation with influencer and boxer Jake Paul.

Paul also posted a video Wednesday with Democratic Party candidate RFK Jr. writing, ""I'm teaching the underdog presidential candidates (who I think are best for this country) how to use Tik Tok because they need the youth to beat the big dogs.""

""He said, 'Do what you want to do in terms of your policies, but if you actually want to reach young people, you've got to show up rather than hiding,'"" Ramaswamy told reporters about their exchange.

And to Ramaswamy's end, his presence on and off the app has certainly gotten the attention of young voters (some responses more sincere than others if you take a look at his comments section), including ""Never Have I Ever"" actor and comedian Chelly who started parodying the entrepreneur after Ramaswamy's breakout moment at the first Republican primary debate.

""I was aware of him before the debate, but I think as far as what I was going to do, parody-wise or like content-wise, It wasn't until I watched that debate that I was like, okay, because part of it was also trying to figure out exactly how to make fun of someone like that,"" he told ABC News.

""He's increased the scope of conversation around politics in general.""

Asked if his impersonation is a critique of Ramaswamy, Chelly says the character has helped him to stay creative during recent writers' and actors' union strikes while also connecting with young people with diverse perspectives about politics through comedy.

""Some of the conversations that we've had with people, it's very different when you have that one-on-one, kind of like FaceTime with someone that like, doesn't have the same perspectives as you, but you start to relate on some other shared experience that you might have had and it kind of like changes your opinion of a person,"" he said.

""For me on a personal level, I do think it's cool seeing, you know, people of South Asian descent just, you know, [it's] becoming more diverse. Obviously, you have Kamala Harris in the White House, you have Nikki Haley, you have Vivek. It's just, it's a thing we always talked about in acting like anytime you see someone like you in the media eye, it just raises the profile for everyone. I love seeing just any sort of diversity, whether it's in entertainment or whether it's in politics and on either party,"" Chelly said.",Q3

Douglas Solomon, 26, was found naked and bleeding after jumping 16 floors out of a building on East 79th Street around 10:30 a.m., the New York Post reported, citing law enforcement sources.

Solomon's mother, Diane Gallagher, 65, was found dead inside an apartment with head trauma. Both were pronounced dead at the scene, the New York Police Department said.

""It was the loudest thud. At first, I thought it was an air conditioning unit,"" a resident of the building, who declined to share his name, told the newspaper.

https://lawandcrime.com/crime/a-horrible-set-of-facts-three-dead-children-and-mother-pulled-from-minnesota-lake-in-potential-triple-murder-suicide/,Three Dead Children and Mother Pulled from Minnesota Lake,"A child’s body was pulled out of a lake due north of St. Paul, Minnesota on Friday evening. Later, the boy’s brother was pulled from that same lake in Vadnais Heights. Authorities feared those were not the last deceased members of the family to be recovered. They were right.

Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher initially described the case as a “potential triple-homicide” on the night of July 1, 2022, NBC News reported. “Obviously, a horrible set of facts appears to be developing.”

“I will tell you that a number of resources are here,” Fletcher continued. “There is nothing more tragic than the loss of young children, all of which were apparently under the age of five. If you’re wondering why we suspect the children are here, the children’s shoes were here.”

Those comments came when just the first boy had been discovered. Since then, all three children and their mother were found dead, according to a press conference early Saturday afternoon. The incident is believed to be a triple murder-suicide.

Multiple agencies began the search at the lake after an initial call about a man’s suicide in Maplewood, Minnesota late Friday morning. After some amount of investigation, extended family members gave authorities information that resulted in the search at the lake.

Maplewood Police Department Lieutenant Joe Steiner offered the following at a press conference on Friday night near the lake:

At 10:30 this morning, Maplewood police responded to a report of a suicide in the 1300 block of Pearson. When they arrived, they found a deceased adult male . . . in relation to that investigation, Maplewood police responded to this location on information of a potential murder-suicide. At this time, there’s an active rescue and recovery operation going on.

The deceased man is believed to be the husband of the mother. Law enforcement say they “have no belief” the man found dead in Maplewood was ever at the lake in question.

Steiner said the mother’s vehicle was found at the lake – along with several additional items that led authorities to believe the family was somewhere in the area, according to CBS News.

Video from the scene recorded by Minneapolis television stations WCCO and KARE showed searchers standing shoulder to shoulder in the water while wearing red wet suits; a law enforcement air boat roamed the lake’s surface.

Around two dozen members of the family watched as the search continued. A task force of state police, local police, sheriff’s deputies, a dive crew, fire crews in boats, and cadaver dogs canvassed the lake as well as the immediate land, according to the Twin Cities Pioneer Press.

That report by Kristi Belcamino and Molly Guthrey notes:

Late Friday night, as the search continued, relatives and friends of the Hmong family started a small fire, which one man said was an appeal to the spirits to help them find the bodies.

“Even imagining this is going to be horrific just to think about,” Fletcher said during a livestream on Friday night. “It’s just tough to get your mind wrapped around how someone does that.”

“If you’re mentally healthy, it’s unimaginable,” Deputy Pat Scott added during that broadcast.

An autopsy will be performed on each of the bodies to determine their precise causes of death, Ramsey County Undersheriff Mike Martin said during a Saturday press conference.

The mother’s body was found by 10:40 a.m. on Saturday, the undersheriff said; the third and final child was found by 11:00 a.m.

Stubbs Justice Center in downtown Akron on Saturday to protest the fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker.

The protest, which began at 2 p.m., was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation's Northeast Ohio Branch.

Various speakers addressed the crowd in front of the Summit County Courthouse, including:

• Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir Rice, 12, who was shot and killed in 2014 by a Cleveland police officer.

• Jacob Blake Sr., father of Jacob Blake Jr., 29, who was shot in the back seven times by an officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020 and partially paralyzed.

• Dee McCall, a military veteran who served for 11 years. McCall is now the community organizer for The Freedom BLOC, a local organization that aims to build Black political power and ""to equip the Black community with capacity-building tools on civic education, civic engagement, campaign management and leadership development.""

""We continue to say Black Lives Matter, yet we continue to protest,"" McCall said. ""This is literally in every city, replicated across the nation. This is the un-United States.""

The Party for Socialism and Liberation's spokesperson, Riley Petro, said that city officials' call to deescalate the Jayland Walker protests Friday was a cynical move.

The plea from Mayor Dan Horrigan, Police Chief Steve Mylett and local pastors came after the deaths of Journei Tolbert, 4, and Johnny L. Gaiter, 40, who were shot at a family celebration Friday evening.

Police, who said they had no suspects as of Saturday and no updates Sunday, said the deaths were not related to the protests.

Later, Walker's cousin Demetrius Travis Sr. said 4-year-old Journei had been the niece of Jaymeisha Beasley, Walker's fiancee who died in a car accident about a month before Walker's death.

""Obviously the death of somebody so young is a tragedy, and I just feel it's awful that city officials would exploit that to try and tamper down on people's freedom of speech,"" Petro said. ""The Akron police have been doing as much as they can to tamper down on protests up to this point with curfews and arresting people who have not really violated any laws.""

One of the protesters in the audience was Alexis Jerels, who lives on Princeton Street, where Friday's shooting took place. Her daughter was Journei's playmate.

In a news release responding to the criticism of how officers are handling demonstrators, Mylett said: ""We have received death threats with officers’ information being posted. We’ve gotten news from the FBI about violent extremists coming to our city and posing as resident demonstrators in order to perpetuate violence.

""These are not excuses, but the reality of what our Akron police officers and our community are currently facing. We understand that APD has an extremely important part to play in creating, maintaining, and promoting peace in our city, in addition to their top priority of protecting public safety. We are committed to those goals and to de-escalating the high tensions that exist.""

Walker's cousin Travis was also at the protest.

""Akron was previously, at least recently, known for great things LeBron James did but now it's marred by, in my estimation, the execution of my cousin,"" he said. ""This is a very devastating story.""

After speeches the group marched up University Avenue to Union Park, where more speakers were waiting to address the crowd.

Police said Sunday there had been no known protest-related arrests overnight.

https://www.xxlmag.com/real-boston-richey-interview-the-break/,The Break Presents – Real Boston Richey,"Life is to be lived. Within it, opportunities can present themselves out of nowhere, but the most important step is to take initiative. In the case of someone like Tallahassee, Fla. rapper Real Boston Richey, rap was never a route he would've entertained until it was at his doorstep. Originally motivated to rhyme by his late cousin, Richey was then nudged by his friend Corey to come to a studio session. That was only 10 months ago, and Richey has already found supporters in Future and Young Scooter. He's also locked down a Lil Durk verse to add to the follow-up of Richey's breakthrough song ""Keep Dissing.""

Real Boston Richey has gotten to this point because his sound is different. Think Florida rap slang and built in cadences with the beats and competitive flair of Detroit hip-hop. Judging by nearly 10 million views on the Durk-assisted ""Keep Dissing 2"" music video in just a month, hip-hop continues to have room for acts trying something new.

Real Boston Richey's unique sound and energy lends to him sticking out in a competitive space when Florida rap is so huge. Add in that Tallahassee hasn't had a big act since T-Pain, and Richey's rise is even more fascinating. His first song, ""Big YIC,"" released in 2021, was the track he made in that aforementioned studio session, but he already showed promise. The Midwestern rap production didn't have the full potential yet, though Richey's confidence and tendency to let every line land before he moves on made his music hit harder than other artists out at the moment. By the time he dropped ""Keep Dissing"" in March of this year—a song he said he paid local DJs to spin until it eventually got leaked—he was more fully formed.

Florida rap has a tendency to highlight the dangers of the street frankly. Despite that, something is very new about Richey's approach to it. The way he layers ideas and punchlines is similar to late 2010s New York rap while his flows are loyal to his home base. In addition to that, he continued dropping songs after the success of ""Keep Dissing,"" and is on the verge of having another huge song in ""Certified Dripper."" Popularized on social media through the use of the song's first four bars—""Bad bitch getter/Real rich nigga/Hellcat whipper/Certified dripper""—there are over 200 million TikToks that feature his lyrics.

As his career begins to take off, Real Boston Richey joined last week's episode of The Break: Live to talk about embracing Tallahassee and working through the city's music scene, Future FaceTiming him and how it feels to have so much momentum after rapping for less than a year.

https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2022/08/30/lead-free-solar-material/,Scientists Grow Lead-Free Solar Material With a Built-In Switch,"Solar panels, also known as photovoltaics, rely on semiconductor devices, or solar cells, to convert energy from the sun into electricity.

To generate electricity, solar cells need an electric field to separate positive charges from negative charges. To get this field, manufacturers typically dope the solar cell with chemicals so that one layer of the device bears a positive charge and another layer a negative charge. This multilayered design ensures that electrons flow from the negative side of a device to the positive side – a key factor in device stability and performance. But chemical doping and layered synthesis also add extra costly steps in solar cell manufacturing.

Now, a research team led by scientists at DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), in collaboration with UC Berkeley, has demonstrated a unique workaround that offers a simpler approach to solar cell manufacturing: A crystalline solar material with a built-in electric field – a property enabled by what scientists call “ferroelectricity.” The material was reported earlier this year in the journal Science Advances.

The new ferroelectric material – which is grown in the lab from cesium germanium tribromide (CsGeBr 3 or CGB) – opens the door to an easier approach to making solar cell devices. Unlike conventional solar materials, CGB crystals are inherently polarized, where one side of the crystal builds up positive charges and the other side builds up negative charges, no doping required.

In addition to being ferroelectric, CGB is also a lead-free “halide perovskite,” an emerging class of solar materials that have intrigued researchers for their affordability and ease of synthesis compared to silicon. But many of the best-performing halide perovskites naturally contain the element lead. According to other researchers, lead remnants from perovskite solar material production and disposal could contaminate the environment and present public health concerns. For these reasons, researchers have sought new halide perovskite formulations that eschew lead without compromising performance.

“If you can imagine a lead-free solar material that not only harvests energy from the sun but also has the added bonus of having a naturally, spontaneously formed electric field – the possibilities across the solar energy and electronics industries are pretty exciting,” said co-senior author Peidong Yang, a leading nanomaterials expert known for his pioneering work in one-dimensional semiconducting nanowires for novel solar cell technologies and artificial photosynthesis. He is a senior faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division and a professor of chemistry and materials science and engineering at UC Berkeley.",Q3
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11091435/Police-hunt-car-linked-suspected-serial-killer-targeting-Muslims-Albuquerque.html,Police hunt car linked to suspected serial killer targeting Muslims,"Authorities investigating whether the killings of four Muslim men are connected said Sunday that they need help finding a vehicle believed to be connected to the deaths in New Mexico's largest city.

Albuquerque police said they released photos of the vehicle suspected of being used in the four homicides hoping people could help identify the car.

Police said the vehicle sought is a dark gray or silver four-door Volkswagen with dark tinted windows, and appears to be a Jetta.

Police did not say where the images were taken or what led them to suspect the car was involved in any of the crimes.

'We have a very, very strong link,' Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said Sunday. 'We have a vehicle of interest . We have got to find this vehicle.'

Police are still trying to determine if there are any connections among the killings.

A Muslim man was killed Friday night in Albuquerque and ambush shootings killed three Muslim men over the past nine months.

The news comes after President Joe Biden took to Twitter Sunday to say he was 'angered and saddened' by the slayings and reiterated his administration 'stands strongly with the Muslim community.'

Pictured is a photo of the vehicle released by Albuquerque police, who said they believe the silver four-door Volkswagen with tinted windows may be linked with the killing of a Muslim men killed on Friday night, the latest in a string of alleged murders targeting Muslims

President Joe Biden has deplored the killings of four Muslim men in New Mexico, which police say may be linked. Naeem Hussain (left) was fatally shot on Friday and Mohammad Ahmadi (right) was killed in November

Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27, (left) and Aftab Hussein, 41, (right) had been fatally shot near their homes on Aug. 1 and July 26, respectively

Police said the all four killings were done in a similar fashion - 'ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed'

Naeem Hussain, a Muslim from South Asia believed to be in his mid-20s, was fatally shot on Friday. He was found dead after police received a call of a shooting.

Earlier this week, police confirmed that local detectives and federal law enforcement officers were looking for possible ties among the separate crimes.

Two of the men - Muhammed Afzaal Hussain, 27, and Aftab Hussein, 41 - were killed in the past week, and both were from Pakistan and members of the same mosque.

The third case involves the November killing of Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, a Muslim man of South Asian descent.

'I am angered and saddened by the horrific killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque,' Biden posted to Twitter on Sunday.

'While we await a full investigation, my prayers are with the victims' families, and my Administration stands strongly with the Muslim community. These hateful attacks have no place in America.'

Police declined to say whether Friday night's homicide was carried out in a way similar to the other deaths.

Authorities said they can't say yet if the shootings were hate crimes until they have identified a suspect and can determine a motive.

'We will bring this person or these persons to justice,' Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said Sunday.

The latest victim was discovered overnight Friday just hours after he attended a funeral service honoring two other recently murdered Muslims.

Hussain was found shot to death Friday near a Lutheran Family Services office that provides assistance to refugees and asylum seekers.

He had attended a funeral service for Aftab Hussein, 41, and Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27, Friday afternoon.

They had been fatally shot near their homes on July 26 and August 1, respectively. The two men were members of the same mosque.

After the ceremony, Hussain and other mourners shared a meal at the Islamic Center of New Mexico.

He left the dinner and was killed several hours later, just before midnight, the Islamic Center told The Albuquerque Journal.

Albuquerque police on Saturday revealed detectives believe Hussain's murder 'may be connected to three recent murders of Muslim men also from South Asia.'

The department was referring to the fatal shootings of Hussein, Afzaal Hussain and Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, who was killed last November behind the halal market he co-owned with his brother.

Police said the all four killings were done in a similar fashion - 'ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed.'

The president's statement echoed that of New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham who said Saturday: 'The targeted killings of Muslim residents of Albuquerque is deeply angering and wholly intolerable.'

'I am angered and saddened that this is happening in New Mexico, a place that prides itself on diversity of culture and thought. This is not who we are.'

Grisham warned: 'We will not stop in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families and are bringing every resource to bear to apprehend the killer or killers - and we WILL find them.'

Hussain, who police say was in his mid-20s, had become an US citizen just two weeks ago and dreamed of being an entrepreneur.

After he came to America, Hussain found work as a truck driver and eventually saved up enough money to buy his own rig. And, when the pandemic struck, he continued to make deliveries telling his loved ones: 'the country and people need us more than any time.'

'You know, he was in love with America,' his brother-in-law Ehsan Shahalami told The Washington Post. 'Everybody that knew him even for an hour is crying, because he has touched their life.'

Hussain's friends said he was a 'really kind person' and there was 'no reason for someone to kill him like this.'

The first murder was carried out on the evening of November 7.

Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, was found outside the cafe he ran with his brother Sharief A. Hadi - Ariana Halal Market & Cafe.

The Afghan-born brothers emigrated to the United States with their father in the early 1980s: first living in Pennsylvania, then moving to New Mexico after Hadi, making a living selling gemstones, came across the region and loved it.

'I had to travel all over, then I got to New Mexico,' Hadi told ABP News Online. 'I like it – the weather and the people were so nice. And I chose to stay here because of my business.'

Hadi and his brother opened the market in 2008, with Ahmadi working as a cook, specializing in traditional Afghan dishes and often catering for groups at the nearby university.

Hadi said he left Ahmadi at the shop to finish cooking, and suspects his brother had gone out to smoke a cigarette when he was shot around 6pm.

'I left at 5 o'clock and he had laid down in the back,' Hadi said. 'When I went home someone called me and said 'Sharief what's going on at your store?' When I came back the police were all over.'

Hadi in January said he was baffled by the unsolved murder.

Aftab Hussein, 41, a busser at a local restaurant who lived with roommates, was murdered on July 28

'I don't have anything to tell you,' he said. 'He is my brother. I loved him, he loved me.'

Eight months later, a second Muslim man was murdered: 41-year-old Aftab Hussein, who moved to New Mexico in 2016.

Working as a busser for a local cafe, Hussein rented a second-story apartment near the Mesa Verde Community Center with two roommates and told them he had recently got engaged to a woman back home in Pakistan.

He was working to get his passport and other travel documents together so he could go to Pakistan and get married, his friend Iftikhar Amirjan told The Albuquerque Journal.

'He was very happy. He said 'I'll go to Pakistan and get married and bring my wife here' and he said 'I'll make my life,' you know,' Amirjan said.

'He said ""I'll buy a house later on and have children"".'

Hussein was shot in the evening of July 26 in the parking lot of the complex where he lived.

His roommates, frightened, have since moved out, while Hussein's brother has flown in from the United Kingdom.

The third killing was on Monday, when well-known local community organizer and city planner Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27, was murdered outside his home.

Born in Pakistan, he moved to the United States in 2017 to get a master's degree in community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico and served as president of the Graduate and Professional Student Association from 2019 to 2020.

Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27, was shot dead outside his home while his brother cooked dinner inside on Monday

He worked with Representative Melanie Stansbury's campaign for Congress and then got a job as the planning and land use director for the city of Española, 90 miles north of Albuquerque.

Hussein had been commuting for the past year but was shortly to move to Española.

His older brother, Muhammad Imtiaz Hussain, a former prosecutor who moved to the US in 2014 to continue studying law, had been staying with his sibling, and brought his two young children with him.

Imtiaz Hussain told The Albuquerque Journal that Afzaal Hussain stepped outside around 9pm, likely to call friends or family in Pakistan, while he cooked dinner.

Neighbors reported seeing a car pull up alongside his brother as someone inside opened fire, shooting once and then four to six more times.

People spread dirt over Aftab Hussein's grave at Fairview Memorial Park in Albuquerque, N.M., on Friday, August 5

'My brother — he was such a decent, lively young man, an unmarried person involved with the community, all the time helping everyone,' Imtiaz Hussain said.

'So what is the motive. Why did they shoot him? If he's shot, how are we safe?

'I want a proactive, rigorous investigation, detailed and speedy trials so that those people who want to take life for another person for nothing.

'Maybe they were stealing his phone, I don't know, whatever.

'But this is life and many lives are connected to him.'

Jordan Yutzy, the Española city manager, said the team was in shock.

'He is going to be truly missed by the city,' Yutzy said.

'He was very smart, very dedicated, and really cared about the community as a whole. His will be very big shoes for the city to fill.'

Leaders from local and federal law enforcement said they have working together and devoting all possible resource to the investigation.

'On top of our investigations into this murder, we're devoting resources to key patrol areas and neighborhoods within Albuquerque,' Police Chief Harold Medina said during a press conference Saturday.

'We lifted overtime caps for our officers so that we could utilize several of our specialized units to help ensure the strong presence of Albuquerque officers to keep the community safe.'

New Mexico State Police, the FBI and the US Marshals Service are among the agencies helping in the investigation.

The city of Albuquerque's Office of Equity and Inclusion has called on citizens to report any information about the slayings to authorities.

'We urge our entire interfaith community of Albuquerque and all the people of Albuquerque to help law enforcement identify and catch the person or persons responsible,' said Michelle Melendez, the office's director. 'Please, please, call with any bit of information.'",Q3
https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2022/07/city-bryant-v-woodall,North Carolina Department of Justice says it will not move to reinforce the state's 20-week abortion ban,"The North Carolina Department of Justice will not move to lift the injunction in Bryant v. Woodall, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein announced on Thursday.

The injunction was granted in 2019 by the district court and prevents the state from enforcing its 20-week abortion ban.

The Bryant v. Woodall case, from which the injunction stems, was filed in 2016 on behalf of abortion providers in North Carolina and their patients seeking abortion care.

""Abortion is an extremely safe medical procedure,"" the case reads, ""The vast majority of abortions performed in the United States and in North Carolina occur in the first trimester of pregnancy. Only a small number of abortions are performed in the United States after 20 weeks. Women seek abortions for many different reasons, relating to their individual situations at the time of that pregnancy.""

Thursday's news follows the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to uphold a Mississippi abortion ban in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, as well as overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion access at the federal level. The rulings leave abortion legislation up to individual states with many states expected to ban or severely restrict abortion access.

According to North Carolina state law, abortions are banned after 20 weeks except to save the life or health of the mother. The Bryant v. Woodall case argued that the ban was unconstitutional since the 20-week marker is several weeks prior to when a pregnancy would be considered medically viable.

The case defines viability as the point at which a fetus is capable of living outside of the uterus under normal conditions. In a normally progressing pregnancy, viability typically does not occur before 24 weeks from the women's last menstrual period.

Further, the case states that fetal viability must be determined by a physician, and no fetus is viable during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

""North Carolina women seeking a pre-viability abortion after the twentieth week of pregnancy in a situation other than a medical emergency as defined in North Carolina law are prohibited from doing so by the 20-week ban,"" the case reads.",Q3

http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-adnan-syed-hearing-differs-from-priveleges-afforded-other-defendants-20220920-yp5ul6xy3zagje6plrdkraaghu-story.html,Adnan Syed walked free from court after his conviction was vacated. Why can’t others do the same?,"Adnan Syed arrived in court Monday from the Patuxent Institution wearing a white dress shirt, dark slacks and a blue plaid tie.

After Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn vacated Syed’s murder conviction in the 1999 killing of Hae Min Lee, she ordered correctional officers to unshackle him on the spot.

Then, Syed, 41, walked out of the courtroom, descended the front steps of the Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse toward Calvert Street while surrounded by family, friends and supporters. A smiling Syed climbed into an SUV that whisked him away to his parents’ Baltimore County home where he will remain under GPS surveillance until prosecutors decide how to proceed with his case.

The entire scene, even the clothes Syed wore, seemed like it was made-for-TV.

It’s also completely atypical of how things normally go when a person is released from custody in Baltimore, according to defense attorneys and legal experts interviewed by The Baltimore Sun.

“I have never seen somebody who was locked up but then acquitted, exonerated or had their conviction vacated walk straight out of the courthouse,” said Natalie Finegar, a defense attorney and former longtime public defender.

Adnan Syed had his murder conviction overturned and was released after prosecutors raised doubts about his guilty finding because of the revelation of alternative suspects in the homicide and unreliable evidence used against him at trial.

Usually, when a person is found not guilty on all charges at trial or has their conviction overturned after serving time in prison, their release from custody goes something like this: Officers handcuff and shackle them in the courtroom, take them to a jail-like facility in the courthouse and transport them back to the correctional facility where they were held.

Only after correctional officials are done “processing” the person are they released, which typically takes several hours, but can last days or even weeks. Normally, people are checked for outstanding warrants and detaining holds placed on them in other jurisdictions.

Mark Vernarelli, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, said the agency followed Phinn’s orders when handling Syed’s case, including the order he be released directly from the courtroom.

Syed’s case came to be known internationally in large part because of the “Serial” podcast, which examined Lee’s killing and the prosecution of Syed, pioneering the true crime genre. Other podcasts, books and documentary series went on to highlight his case.

Baltimore city prosecutors moved to vacate Syed’s conviction after an approximately yearlong investigation conducted with his attorney, Erica Suter, revealed two alternative suspects in the homicide, at least one of whom was not disclosed to the defense before Syed’s trial, they wrote in court documents. The prosecutors’s motion focused on the other suspects and evidence used against Syed at trial that has since been deemed unreliable.

The question, legal experts and defense attorneys said, is not why Syed, whose case is extraordinary by most measures, was treated with such dignity during his release but why others aren’t afforded the same treatment.

“It would be wonderful if every criminal defendant that’s been exonerated could be treated just like Mr. Syed,” defense attorney Donald Wright said. “Take the cuffs off and let them walk away, because at that point there’s no legal reason to keep them detained.”

Syed was not exonerated. Phinn overturned his conviction, but his charges stemming from the decades-old homicide are still pending.

In March, Wright said he represented a man in a murder case and won an acquittal at trial. Unlike Syed, sheriff’s deputies escorted Wright’s client in handcuffs back to lockup, despite a jury declaring him innocent moments earlier.

Wright said he also was among the many defense lawyers working on the post-conviction proceedings for people whose cases involved members of Baltimore Police’s corrupt Gun Trace Task Force. The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office in 2019 sought to vacate more than 800 convictions tainted by the officers, who have since been convicted and sent to federal prison.

“In none of those cases,” Wright recalled, “was the defendant allowed to walk down the steps of the courthouse.”

Judges have wide discretion when determining how things run in their courtrooms, but rarely can someone be unshackled on the spot due to post-judicial processing that has to be completed.

“Even when the judge says not guilty, as a matter of protocol, the correctional officers will shackle a person to take them back into lockup,” Maryland Public Defender Natasha Dartigue told The Sun.

The Maryland Judiciary did not respond to questions about Syed’s treatment, while a spokesperson for the city state’s attorney’s office declined to comment.

The warrant and detainer checks, depending on when a verdict or judge’s ruling is delivered, might not begin immediately and a person isn’t released until after they are completed. Ultimately, there’s no set time or method for when a person is ultimately released.

“I’ve had clients who have walked home from jail in the dark,” Finegar said.

People charged with crimes who are detained pending trial are entitled to wear court-appropriate clothing, like a dress shirt and slacks, in front of the jury. Guards walk defendants to their seat at trial and remove their wrist restraints before the jury enters the room.

Court clothes are allowed for jury trials because someone wearing a prison jumpsuit appearing before a jury could be interpreted as an indicator of guilt or perceived as a security threat, Finegar said.

If a person is acquitted, Dartigue said, they have to change back into the jail jumpsuit while they wait to be processed.

And if a person is not appearing in front of a jury, like Syed on Monday, it’s unlikely they will even be allowed to wear anything other than the jumpsuit.

“The way the system works on a daily basis completely ignores and undermines the humanity of the people who go through it,” said David Jaros, faculty director of the University of Baltimore School of Law’s Center for Criminal Justice Reform.

It should be noted, Jaros said, that Syed’s treatment was made possible in part because both the prosecution and defense agreed ahead of the hearing on what should happen and submitted written motions to the judge outlining their positions.

It did not hurt, many said, that Syed is the subject of podcasts and documentaries, with a film crew following his family, his lawyers and the prosecution before and after the hearing.

But fame should not grant special treatment, defense attorneys said, and Syed’s mostly dignified release from custody has advocates questioning why the post-judgment processing can’t take place during or even before scheduled proceedings.

“The courts and pretrial [services] would say they don’t have the ability or the manpower to do it instantaneously because of the number of the people who are being processed in the course of the day,” Dartigue said. “But that would absolutely be the most humane and dignifying way to do things.”",Q3
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/09/19/irs-gave-tax-exempt-status-soros-backed-group-accused-targeting-trump-republicans/,Soros-Backed Group Accused of Targeting 'Trump Republicans' Has IRS Tax Exemption,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which has a well-documented history of targeting conservatives, granted tax-exempt status in April to a Soros-backed organization now accused of trying to pay an attorney to spread “fake news” about former President Donald Trump and “Trump Republicans.”

Attorney and legal commentator Preston Moore posted a video over the weekend saying he was offered, and rejected, $400 by the “Good Information Foundation” to make a video attacking Donald Trump and “Trump Republicans.” The foundation allegedly wanted Moore to create the video about January 6 and post it on his social media platforms to reach the widest possible audience.

Moore emphasized he is not a Trump supporter and had initially considered accepting, until the organization began dodging questions about the factual accuracy of its campaign. In Moore’s video, he includes email screenshots allegedly from the Good Information Foundation with “important notes” which read:

Say “criminal conspiracy,” not “attempted coup,” “treason,” or “insurrection.” Say “Trump Republicans,” not “Trump and his allies.” Say “January 6th investigation” not “hearing” or “trial” Call this an “attack on our country” or an attack on “America” or on “Americans” and a “criminal conspiracy,” “committed crime.” Talk about “MAGA Republicans” etc. Make clear this is an ongoing and unresolved, not past and done. Show voter agency, turn the anger into defiance [emphasis added].

“It became really clear that … they wanted me to use the most graphic images possible,” he told Breitbart News. “They wanted me to use fear to manipulate people into voting blue, or into voting not Trump. … And when they’re giving examples of the things they wanted me to say — don’t say ‘Trump and his allies,’ say ‘Trump Republicans’ — it became really clear that this was about putting out information … to impact midterms.”

According to its website, the Good Information Foundation is the 501 (c)(3) nonprofit arm of Good Information Inc., “a public benefit corporation committed to restoring social trust and strengthening democracy by investing in solutions that counter disinformation and increase the flow of good information online.” Good Information Inc., which is backed by billionaires Reid Hoffman, George Soros, and others was established in 2021 to fund media companies and “efforts that tackle disinformation,” Axios reported in October 2021.

“Good Information Inc. aims to fund and scale businesses that cut through echo chambers with fact-based information. As part of its mission, it plans to invest in local news companies,” according to the report.

The Good Information Foundation’s website says it is a “501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2021 to tackle the growing information crisis in America that is undermining social trust, harming public health, and damaging our democracy.” The organization further proclaims that “good information is the lifeblood of democracy” and that it wants “to increase the flow of good, factual information online to counter and rebut the spread of misinformation and disinformation.”

The organization’s 501(c)(3) status is especially notable because the designation is typically reserved for organizations that serve a noble public interest, such as public education and charitable work. A 501(c)(3) designation allows these organizations to forgo paying taxes on revenue and allows donors to write off donations.

Breitbart News asked the IRS on Monday if the Good Information Foundation’s alleged activities put the organization in violation of 501(c)(3) rules. The IRS said it cannot comment on the legality of an organization’s actions without an official audit and pointed to a federal statute that mandates that 501(c)(3) organizations are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.”

The IRS’s website reads:

Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.

While former President Donald Trump has not announced a highly anticipated 2024 presidential run, many Trump-backed Republicans are currently running for office, and many of those races are quite competitive and will ultimately determine the balance of power for President Joe Biden’s remaining time in office — meaning, the organization’s alleged activity could be in direct violation of the statute.

Breitbart News reached out to the Good Information Foundation for comment and asked if the accusation is true and if the organization has contacted others similarly or used the same approach against other public officials or candidates. The organization did not reply by publication time.",Q3

Charles A. Pfanschmidt, his wife Matilda, daughter Blanch, 14, and Emma Kaempen (a school teacher who was living with the Pfanschmidts) were murdered at the home. Their bodies were then dismembered, and the home set ablaze. An immediate search for the murderer started right away. Arrested for the crime was Ray Pfanschmidt, the son of Charles and Matilda, he was tried and found guilty on April 19, 1913 and was given the death penalty. He was supposed to be put to death in October of 1913, but here's where it gets interesting.

Ray's lawyers wanted a new trail immediately after the guilty verdict and was denied. They kept at it pushing and pushing all the way to the Supreme Court and finally was granted a new trail, so Pfanschmidt's death sentence was postponed. The new trail started in February of 1914 and Pfanschmidt's lawyers laid out a very interesting case. First, the case was moved from Adams County to Macomb so that Pfanschmidt could get a fair trail. Then they pleaded their case. It all came down to two dogs named Nick Carter” and “Roger Williams.”

Supposedly, when the initial investigation took place they used these hound dogs to find Pfanschmidt after the murders, which they did find him hiding around 12th Street in Quincy. What Pfanschmidt's lawyers pointed out was that how could these dogs track his scent from Payson to Quincy. Yes, these are trained dogs, but Pfanschmidt had taken the same route over and over and over so many times that yes, his scent would be picked up, so how could you tell if the scent was from the night of the murder or from another time, he took the route to visit the family. The argument worked, he was found not guilty. This case has been used in a few cases involving what is called ""dog-testimony,"" People v. Pfanschmidt. 262 Ill. 411 (1914). & People v. Cruz. 162 Ill. 2d 314 (1994).

In doing more research on the Pfanschmidt murders, I didn't find anyone who was arrested for the murders. There was also nothing I could find as to why Ray would want to kill his parents, sisters, and their guest. According to a report in the Quincy Herald Whig published on December 15, 1932 Ray Pfanschmidt was killed in New York City no details on how were given.

No one was ever convicted of the brutal murders for Pfanschmidt family and Miss Emma Kaempen and remains unsolved to this day.",Q3

Body-camera footage released this week shows police breaking Christian Glass' car window and a Clear Creek County sheriff’s deputy firing five rounds at Glass while he was inside his car.

The incident happened after Glass called 911 for roadside assistance in the small mountain town of Silver Plume, Colorado, roughly 45 miles west of Denver.

The case is renewing calls from advocates that police must prioritize de-escalation when responding to mental health crises, instead of reacting with force.

Context: Advocates say police are not best suited to handle the myriad mental health-related calls they receive — calls that advocates say are dialed in to law enforcement because mental health services are so lacking.

Up to 50% of fatal encounters with law enforcement involve someone with a mental illness, a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine estimated.

In Denver and New York, behavioral health specialists are sent to 911 callers facing crises that police may not be trained to address or could even exacerbate.

What happened in June: After Christian Glass' June 11 death, the Clear Creek County Sheriff's office issued a news release saying that Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him.

But body-cam footage shows Glass pleading with officers and at one point offering to disarm himself by throwing his knives out of his car window.

What's happening now: Colorado's Fifth Judicial District, which includes Clear Creek County, said it is investigating the case along with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. They plan to eventually issue a report on the shooting or present the case to a grand jury, which would decide if indictments should be issued.

Advocates say de-escalation was needed

Police haven't said if any behavioral health specialists were called for Glass.

Use-of-force and de-escalation experts who reviewed the footage said the case is an example of when a behavioral health specialist or crisis response team — programs becoming increasingly popular across the country — may have helped de-escalate the situation and avert Glass’ death.

“There are some real red flags that suggest potential problems,” said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and leading use-of-force expert who reviewed portions of the footage. Stoughton testified in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who murdered George Floyd.

Siddhartha Rathod, the attorney for Christian's parents, Simon and Sally Glass, said Glass had no history of mental illness.

Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, has proposed legislation aimed at helping more police departments create and fund teams that pair police officers with mental health workers.

The effort would use existing COPS grants — Community Oriented Police Services funding — that can be used for a wide variety of local police efforts. Much of the money is available to help communities hire more officers or improve school safety.

What happened the night of June 11?

Body-camera footage shows a sheriff’s deputy firing five rounds at Christian Glass after shooting him with bean bag rounds and shocking him with a stun gun.

The footage shows Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified"" and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don't let them break the window.”

When the officers did break the window, Glass seemed to panic and grabbed a knife.

Police then shot Glass with bean bag rounds and shocked him with a stun gun before the young man twisted in his seat and thrust a knife toward an officer, the footage showed. Then one officer fired his gun, hitting Glass. The recordings then show Glass stabbing himself before he died.

An autopsy report released by the family's attorney found Glass had THC, a .01% blood alcohol concentration, and amphetamine in his system, the last of which Rathod said is likely from an ADHD prescription for Glass.

“Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” Rathod said. “And yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.”

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said.

Family demands accountability

At a tearful press conference Tuesday, Christian's mother, Sally Glass, displayed a pendant of Jesus recovered from her son’s car engraved with the words, “Pray for us.”

“We have to pray for us in America to make this a less violent country,” Sally Glass said. “I think a lot of people now would agree that there is a systemic problem with policing: It’s too aggressive. They escalate at every opportunity, and it looks like they are spoiling for a fight. ... They should be protecting us, not attacking us.”

Glass said her son was “petrified” and “paralyzed” by fear the night he was killed.

“I have a hole in my heart, and it will be there until the day I die,” Glass said.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/8/9/23297170/bodies-bodies-bodies-review-horror-movie-amandla-stenberg-pete-davidson,‘Bodies Bodies Bodies’ a smart horror comedy about some very dumb people,"“If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it’s not going to be fired, it shouldn’t be hanging there.” – Anton Chekhov.

Oh do they have fun with “Chekhov’s Gun” in the razor-sharp and pitch-black horror comedy blood-fest that is “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” the latest in a recent stream of self-aware social satires (“Vengeance,” “Not Okay”) about narcissistic millennials and Gen Z-ers who think of their lives as ongoing narratives made for Twitter and Instagram and TikTok and are almost never in the moment because they’re too busy recording the moment, posing for the moment and offering superficial and self-indulgent commentary on the moment.

With clever and assured direction filled with striking visuals by the Dutch actor-writer-filmmaker Halina Reijn (adapting Sarah DeLappe’s screenplay, which is based on a story by Kristen Roupenian) and a cast of talented and great-looking young actors throwing themselves into the wonderfully twisted material, “Bodies Bodies Bodies” plays like a slasher-film update of “And Then There Were None,” with a dash of the classic “Twilight Episode” episode titled “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street” sprinkled in.

‘Bodies Bodies Bodies’

Untitled

A24 presents a film directed by Halina Reijn and written by Sarah DeLappe. Rated R (for violence, bloody images, drug use, sexual references and pervasive language). Running time: 94 minutes. Opens Wednesday at local theaters.



Not that there’s a chance in Hades any of these preening idiots has ever seen “The Twilight Zone” or is aware of anything that took place before they came into this world, as they’re just about the most vapid, nihilistic, self-consumed and petty group you’ll ever see. (They’re like older siblings of the gang from “Euphoria”—with murder added to the mix of sex and drugs and duplicitous machinations.)

“Bodies Bodies Bodies” kicks off with Amandla Stenberg’s Sophie, who has recently finished a stint in rehab, passionately kissing her new girlfriend Bee (Maria Bakalova from “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm”) and telling Bee the people she’s about to meet aren’t as awful as they might initially appear to be. Is Bee about to meet Sophie’s parents? No way, this isn’t some 1990s comedy; we’re talking about Sophie’s longtime best friends (and one new addition to the group), including:



Rachel Sennott’s Alice, who has a podcast and loves the sound of her own voice and has recently Tindered-up with a McConaughey-esque older dude named Greg (Lee Pace), who has ripped abs and a hippie-dippie disposition and, apparently, the I.Q. of a potato.

Chase Sui Wonders’ Emma, an aspiring actress with a fragile personality, and Emma’s boyfriend David (Pete Davidson), a smarmy, trust-fund brat who prattles about in a hoodie, saying terrible things about, well, everybody.

Myha’la Herrold’s Jordan, who is Sophie’s ex and is so angry and intense and has so many chips on her shoulder it’s a wonder she doesn’t tip over.

They’ve all gathered at the Westchester County, New York, mansion owned by David’s absentee parents so they can party the weekend away and ride out a hurricane. Sophie and Bee are welcomed with passive-aggressive sincerity on the part of some and outright hostility from others. (Bee has brought a loaf of homemade zucchini bread as a friendly gesture and is instantly mocked for it. What is this girl, SINCERE or something?) When Sophie announces she’s sober, there are some phony expressions of admiration and encouragement, followed quickly by more shots of tequila, more glasses of champagne, more lines of coke, more tokes of weed, more snarky comments. We can understand why these rich, privileged, backstabbing people have been friends for so long; nobody else would want to spend more than five minutes in their presence.

And that’s what makes it so funny and richly satisfying when the bloodshed begins. We have no idea who the killer is, but we’re kinda rooting for them. Sorry, not sorry.

As the storm begins to rage outside, the group plays a game that involves smacking each other, as hard as possible, across the face. Hilarious! Next up, a round of “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” a role-playing murder game that takes a grisly turn when one member of the group turns up on the pool deck, blood spurting from their neck in classic drive-in movie fashion before they keel over, dead dead dead.

Of course, the power goes out, and of course, nobody can get cell phone service, and of course, terrible secrets are revealed, and horrible insults are hurled and let’s just say the body count doesn’t stop at one. Terms such as “ableist” and “gaslighting” and “toxic” and “body dysmorphia” and “borderline” are bandied about, sometimes to hilariously comedic effect, because these people are so damn clueless, no matter how well-informed they fancy themselves to be.

The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent at capturing the insecurities and the selfish ambitions and the neediness of this group, who turn against one another at a time when they have only each other to protect themselves from the coming storm—and we’re not talking about that hurricane. This is a devilishly funny and terrifically warped slice of slasher satire.

The car crashed into the luxury store on Wilshire Boulevard just before 5 a.m., and the suspects fled in a getaway car before police arrived only three minutes later, the police announced. Police are still searching for the suspects, and it remains unclear whether the car was stolen.

“Due to our robust technology and the evidence left at scene, I am confident we will make arrests in this case,” Beverly Hills Police Chief Mark Stainbrook said in a public statement. “We understand the concerns of the community and our staff continues to arrest people who commit crime in Beverly Hills. This case will be no different. Crime of any kind will not be tolerated in Beverly Hills.” (RELATED: ‘Never Seen Anything Like It’: LA Residents Rattled As Violent Crime Finally Seeps Into Wealthy Neighborhoods)

The incident is the latest smash-and-grab crime in the upscale neighborhoods surrounding Los Angeles; brazen shoplifting, often of thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise, has become a constant issue in these areas, according to the Los Angeles Times. Burglaries are down slightly since 2020 while the murder rate has surged since 2019, but public attention has focused on the trend of high-profile burglary and vandalism of high-end stores in wealthy Los Angeles suburbs.

The Beverly Hills Police Department directed the Daily Caller News Foundation to Stainbrook’s statement and had no further information to share.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-30/how-feds-choreographed-elaborate-fake-murder-to-nab-l-a-developer,How feds choreographed an elaborate fake murder to stop L.A. developer’s alleged plot,"Arthur Aslanian wasn’t taking any chances when he met his employee, Sesar Rivera, on the side of a road earlier this month.

Only after patting Rivera down to check if he was wearing a wire and making him leave his phone in Aslanian’s pickup truck did he look at the photograph Rivera had brought.

It was a gruesome image of a dead man who had been shot in the face.

The real estate developer studied the photo to make sure it was the proof he wanted. “That’s him, man, that’s him,” he said.

Rivera asked Aslanian what to do with the photo.

“F— shred it,” Aslanian responded.

Aslanian left the roadside meeting believing the photo confirmed that a plan he set in motion had succeeded, according to an account of the meeting provided by the U.S. attorney’s office. The man in the photo was a banker who had been fighting to recoup about $3 million Aslanian owed him. Instead of paying, prosecutors allege, Aslanian had hired an assassin.

Aslanian, however, had just been fooled.

Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had been tracking him for months and had nabbed Rivera weeks earlier as he was trying to find a hit man for his boss, authorities said. Rivera had agreed to cooperate with the investigation and, despite the pat-down, Aslanian failed to find the two recording devices agents had concealed on him that captured the chilling exchange, according to federal prosecutors.

And the banker was alive and well. The photograph was the work of a makeup artist — the coup de grace of a straight-out-of-Hollywood ruse agents had devised to ensnare Aslanian.

Hours after his meeting with Rivera, Aslanian was arrested at his upscale La Cañada Flintridge home. He was indicted Thursday along with Rivera on two counts of conspiracy to commit murder for hire. Prosecutors allege that on top of plotting to kill the business associate, who is identified by his initials S.E. in court papers, Aslanian planned to have another man killed as well.

“Mr. Aslanian denies all the allegations against him and maintains his innocence,” said Melanie Killedjian, Aslanian’s attorney in the criminal case.

Weeks earlier, Aslanian’s other alleged target, attorney Mark Young, was in court when he got a message: ATF agents wanted to meet with him. Immediately.

As the longtime bankruptcy lawyer drove from the courthouse in Alhambra to the ATF’s Glendale office, he and his assistant Hallie Browne tried to determine if he was being scammed. The pressing reality did not settle over Young until he and Browne exited the elevator and he saw the ornate carpet of the ATF office emblazoned with the Department of Justice’s insignia. Several agents sat them down in a conference room, Young recalled.

“We need to inform you that you’re the intended victim in a murder-for-hire plot,” Young said the agents told him. “There’s a hit that’s been put out for you.”

The color drained from Young’s face, Browne recalled.

The agents asked if he knew Aslanian.

Young told them he had represented Aslanian in a bankruptcy proceeding from 2018 to 2021. Aslanian, he said, was refusing to pay more than $250,000 he owed in legal fees. Young had last contacted Aslanian about the debt in April, when he sent him a letter detailing how much he owed and putting him on notice that he could be sued.

The agents informed Young that Aslanian had launched a plan to hire a hit man to have him killed. They did not tell him Aslanian was also planning the murder of another man.

While he knew Aslanian to be an aggressive businessman, Young had never seen a violent side of him, he said.

“I was scared. I didn’t know whether I should go into witness protection or something. When I told my wife, we were shaken and spent the next three nights at a hotel,” Young said in an interview.

Photos of Aslanian with his daughters line the front hall alongside diplomas. On a recent day, a white terrier barked at the door.

When reached by The Times, a colleague described Aslanian as a “family man” and was incredulous that he had been arrested.

People who live at properties Aslanian owns, however, were less surprised. Several renters described him as a “slumlord” who mistreated them.

“He’s been harassing a lot of his tenants,” said Jonpaul Rodriguez, who lives with his wife in a bungalow complex Aslanian owns in North Hollywood. The couple are currently on a rent strike. “He is a slumlord.”

Rodriguez and his wife, Clare Letmon, claim that Aslanian has allowed the property to fall into disrepair so that he can demolish it and build a larger complex. Raccoons live in some of the empty bungalows, and the tenants say that Aslanian ripped out parts of the walls while tenants were living inside. Some of the bungalows on the property are boarded up and red-tagged, and charred detritus is strewn about from a March fire.

Aslanian’s checkered history at his properties dates back decades. He was charged with a misdemeanor in 1998 for allegedly failing to pay more than $100,000 to workers for repairs at a homeless shelter in Koreatown. His company was found guilty of a labor code violation in the case, court records show.

He was busted again in 2007 after another one of his companies was found to have violated city rules requiring building permits. The company was placed on probation for a year, according to court documents from that case.

On top of the criminal cases, Aslanian and his companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits more than two dozen times, court records show.

Nonetheless, Aslanian continued to grow his real estate portfolio. He owns three adjacent plots on Hartsook Street in North Hollywood through a company, Andalucia Project LLC, according to property records. He also owns a handful of other properties throughout the San Fernando Valley, including a modern apartment building a few blocks away, records show.

But Aslanian was also building a mountain of debt. On top of the legal fees Young said he owed, Aslanian owed S.E. nearly $3 million over a dispute involving a Brentwood property that led to years of litigation, according to a judge’s ruling in the case.

During an interview with ATF agents, Rivera recounted how Aslanian had explained to him that he wanted S.E. killed because he believed the man was a “piece of s—” and a “no good motherf—” who “probably deserves it,” according to the criminal complaint.

At Aslanian’s behest, Rivera in April approached a gang member both men knew to carry out the killings, prosecutors allege. The gang member, who is not identified in court records, had convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and other crimes, according to the complaint.

After Rivera explained what Aslanian wanted done, the gang member responded that he was interested in the job. The two met again in July and Rivera informed the would-be killer that Aslanian wanted the men killed “as quickly as possible,” according to the complaint.

At the meeting, Rivera pulled up a photo of Young online and confirmed for the gang member that Young was the lawyer Aslanian wanted dead, the complaint said.

The two negotiated a $20,000 payment for Young’s murder. The gang member asked for half the money to be paid in advance, but Rivera refused, saying Aslanian would only pay when Young was dead, the complaint said.

And, he added, his boss wanted “photographic proof” that the murder had taken place, according to the complaint.

Soon after, the gang member went to police. He spilled the plot and played a recording he had secretly made of the recent meeting with Rivera, according to the complaint. He claimed that he had planned to take Aslanian’s money but not follow through with the killings, according to the criminal complaint. And he said he hoped that in exchange for bringing Aslanian and Rivera’s plan to light he would be given leniency in a separate criminal case, the complaint said.

The ATF opened an investigation into Aslanian and Rivera, and had the gang member, who is referred to in court documents as a cooperating witness, set up a meeting with Rivera on Aug. 24, the complaint said. He brought with him “a friend from Arizona” who told Rivera he could “get the job done,” the complaint said.

The friend, an undercover agent with the ATF, tried to sell Rivera on his credentials, telling him he hung out with sicarios, Spanish for hired assassins, according to the complaint.

He offered Rivera different scenarios for the murders, the complaint said. It could be a burglary gone wrong or a road-rage incident.

Or he could just “cap the dude,” the undercover agent suggested.

Aslanian didn’t care how it got done, Rivera responded. Aslanian would pay for the killings but wanted nothing else to do with them, Rivera explained, according to the complaint.

“Whatever happens, accident, whatever,” Rivera said, according to the complaint.

After the meeting, ATF surveillance teams tracked Rivera and Aslanian. They watched as the men drove later in the afternoon to Skinny’s Lounge, a bar in North Hollywood. Agents took photos and videos as the men talked for several minutes in the bar’s parking lot before driving off, the complaint said.

Authorities detained Rivera on Sept. 7. He told them that it had been the gang member who approached Rivera to ask if he needed someone to be “gotten rid of” — not the other way around. Rivera also said Aslanian only wanted to kill S.E. and not Young, whom he just wanted “intimidated.”

Agents convinced Rivera to help them nab Aslanian. They hatched their plan.

The following day, they had Rivera wear a wire and meet with Aslanian, according to the complaint. Rivera informed Aslanian that the gang member was “going to handle” the murder of S.E., according to the complaint.

Aslanian reminded Rivera to be careful.

“Make sure [the gang member] and yourself have an alibi,” Aslanian said. “After today, we don’t talk about it ever again.”

With Aslanian believing the murder of S.E. was imminent, agents had S.E. made up to look like he had been shot and staged the photos of the killing.

Young said that agents asked him if he too would be game to stage his murder. He recalled them telling him that if he went along with the plan he would need to stay out of sight for up to a week. Agents suggested a trip to Palm Springs, Young said. He and his wife considered visiting Pismo Beach on the Central Coast.

He agreed to do it, but in the end, he said, agents told him it wasn’t necessary because Aslanian wanted S.E. killed first.

Aslanian is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles without bail. Rivera was released on bond, according to his attorney.

Nobody was hurt, but the ordeal was jarring nonetheless for the 67-year-old Young. Throughout it all, he was allowed to tell only his wife and his assistant, who had joined him at the first meeting with the ATF, about what was happening. He and Browne would share knowing glances at the law office. She said she asked him for updates occasionally, but did not want to add to his stress.

With the murder plot foiled, Young said he feels he has cheated death three times in a year, having recovered from a pulmonary embolism and surgery for colon cancer.

“I don’t know how many more of my nine lives I have,” he said.

https://www.police1.com/school-safety/articles/state-your-case-do-armed-teachers-improve-school-safety-2K3xDurWzuSrLCTr/,State your case: Do armed teachers improve school safety?,"Do armed teachers improve school safety? That question has been hotly debated in recent years following the tragic shootings we have seen at schools across the country including the May 24 shooting at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.

We asked Police1 readers if they believe schools are safer if teachers are armed. Nearly 1,000 respondents answered our poll. Sixty-one percent of you do think schools are safer if teachers are armed, while 29% do not.

Read our columnists’ take on this issue and share your opinion below.

The ground rules: As in an actual debate, the pro and con sides are assigned randomly as an exercise in critical thinking and analyzing problems from different perspectives.

Our debaters: Jim Dudley, a 32-year veteran of the San Francisco Police Department where he retired as deputy chief of the Patrol Bureau, and Chief Joel Shults, EdD, who retired as chief of police in Colorado.

Joel Shults: As a local school board member, the Uvalde school shooting has re-ignited interest in strategies to deal with intruder violence. One of my frustrations is that, even though I am a concealed carry holder who religiously exercises the carrying part (I don’t do LEOSA), Colorado law makes me a felon if I walk onto school property with any of my small arsenal. This effectively creates one of those fictional gun-free zones we hear so much about.

The core problem of immediate response to an immediate deadly threat on the sanctity of school grounds is waiting for the police to arrive. While the idea that we can predict what a violent attack will look like is unrealistic, one of the few constants in such events is the reality that time spent waiting for law enforcement response is free time for killing to the attacker. Even when a police officer is present or nearby, the ability to have a god-like omnipresence on every acre and square foot of school property simply doesn’t exist.

What if an attacker didn’t know whether they would confront armed resistance before they heard sirens or police commands? What if a counterattack came from inside the classrooms and hallways instead of from outside the doors of the school building? It seems to me that the deterrent value of armed school staff would weigh in heavily in favor of gun-toting schoolteachers.

In an examination of 433 school shootings published in “The New York Times,” 249 ended before any law enforcement arrived. Of the remaining 184, police shot the attacker in 98 cases, otherwise subduing them in 33 cases. Comparatively, bystanders interceded prior to police arrival in 64 cases, 22 by shooting and in 42 by subduing them by other means. (In 10 of the 22 shootings the person using a firearm to end the attack was either a security guard or an off-duty police officer). What I see in these stats is an argument for pre-police intervention, and there would surely be some school staff willing and able to pack a pocket pistol with their brown bag lunch.

Jim Dudley: I am not sure how to say exactly how wrong this idea is without insulting the teaching profession, but I’ll try. There are so many variables when it comes to arming someone with a firearm with an expectation that they may have to use it on another person.

I have a perspective of both sides of this argument, after serving over 30 years in a large metropolitan city. I have been in armed encounters where the offenders were armed with blunt and bladed instruments and on a few occasions, they were armed with firearms. I used my firearm against another person in one encounter, and if I hadn’t, someone else would be writing this side of the argument.

I also have the perspective as a teacher, serving for the past 10 years as a full-time member of the criminal justice studies faculty at my university in San Francisco.

No teacher ever signed up to train with and to carry a firearm. There are certainly some teachers who should absolutely not be armed with a firearm in a school setting. The expectations of both professions overlap with some similarities, but they are more disparate than similar.

Police officers go through vigorous testing from the beginning, with written, oral and physical testing that they must pass above the standard, only to go on to further batteries of psychological testing, a polygraph test and intensive background research. One segment of the 30 weeks or so of academy training involves learning about the nomenclature of the firearm, the circumstances of when to draw it and when to use lethal force upon another. Case laws are reviewed, simulations are experienced, and officers must learn the nuances of force options, resorting to the firearm, only as a last resort. Another 16 to 24 hours (or more) is dedicated to learning about positioning and shooting at targets from 3,5,7,15 and 25 yards or more at a silhouette in the shape of a human being. Most agencies require re-training and qualifications at firearms ranges with a 75%-80% proficiency threshold. Would marksmanship training become a bi-annual part of a teachers new continuing professional training requirement?

It is unlikely that an educator would go through this type of testing and training in the first place. It is even more unlikely for the teacher to draw and fire at another person, perhaps a student, a female, or a person of color. In school shootings, we have seen that young people are often the perpetrators. Studies have shown a reluctance of soldiers to shoot at another human being. These are soldiers. I can imagine the struggle that educators would have when confronted with having to shoot another person.

Police officers are trained to make quick decisions and use deadly force when all factors are present. It is one thing for a teacher to calmly say they will use a firearm in defense of themselves or other students, but it is quite a different story in reality.

Other factors include firearm accessibility. Will they be concealed carry? Will they be locked in a “readily accessible storage lock box?” Every officer knows the answer to the “quickly accessible” storage containers dilemma.

I understand, Joel, about the immediacy of teachers being on scene long before the police unit arrives, but I believe that the hesitation delay would nullify the advantages.

Teachers running around schools in civilian clothing, firearms in hand, will be prime targets to arriving units. In the heat of the moment, teachers may not be expected to ignore instincts to continue to pursue the perpetrator or to stop firing at them. It is a predictable tragedy. Shooting bystanders is a real possibility as well. As studies have shown, firearms in the home account for unintended consequences that include accidental discharges, stolen weapons and even suicides.

Will teachers be protected with a sort of qualified immunity if they make a mistake and shoot the wrong people or have an accidental discharge?

Teachers have a role in our schools but being an armed defender should not be an added requirement.

Joel Shults: Certainly, there are questions, Jim, about storage, liability, the ability of untrained persons to perform under pressure, and all of the dangers of firearms ownership and use. I think these can be overcome.

The mere arming of teachers who volunteer to carry would only be a part of a prevention/early response plan. As you know, police officers shoot with only a 30% accuracy in the real world, despite their training and stress inoculation. Street criminals using firearms don’t fare much worse (no concern for life, liability, policy, safety downrange, etc., to slow their decision-making), so we know that reflex shooting by a civilian at what would necessarily be close range might not be as messy as we think.

I am still perplexed by the urge to evacuate when students are safest behind a locked classroom door. If the only objective an armed teacher has is to keep an attacker on the other side of a locked door, that would address the greatest likelihood of ever having to fire a weapon – reasonably close range and framed by the doorway.

We’ve also seen the heroism of teachers, and even students and other staff, who have intervened and stopped or slowed attackers. What that proves, I think, is that the willing spirit and desire to protect children can only add positively to the equation. Not everyone will want to carry a gun but those who can, should. If the attacker wants to play whack-a-mole to find out what classrooms will offer deadly resistance, that’s a chance the shooter will have to take.

Jim Dudley: Joel, you present terrific anecdotal examples of heroism, but I would estimate that those done by non-sworn as rare occurrences, rather than the rule. Law enforcement officers undergo the aforementioned training and have experience and expertise. Still, the response does not always go as planned. We have seen some faulty judgment and tactics that may cause tragedies to result. I’m sorry to say the incidences of negative outcomes would occur as a result of universally arming teachers and educators.

Our best defense against these types of attacks is in prevention, not response. We need to have better situational awareness of those behaving erratically, making threats and amassing arsenals. We then need to be able to address them with threat assessments to those situations, rather than ignore or dismiss them. It also reinforces the need to have good, diligent school resource officers in schools with open and clear communication with students and faculty.

Joel Shults: Prevention is absolutely the priority and perhaps making potential shooters think twice about whether they are going to face a teacher with a gun can be a part of that prevention effort. When we imagine school staff with a firearm, we might envision a movie character version of Bruce Willis sneaking through the ductwork to take aim. But really all we have to do is to let a teacher who is willing and able to bear a firearm do so and be clear that their only responsibility is for their kids in their classroom. That limits the chaos that we fear from mistakes and misfires and zeroes in on the greatest point of vulnerability. We need not keep our soft targets soft.

Police1 readers respond

I have been teaching a nationally recognized armed teacher/school faculty program in Ohio for the past nine years. The program is called FASTER Saves Lives

Teachers should just be teachers, they don’t have the mindset to be armed unless they just got back from active combat. School resource officers should be active deputies, not part-timers or auxiliaries.

It’s neither necessary nor desirable to arm all teachers. Volunteers, including staff, should be vetted to root out anyone with questionable mental stability and they should be required to train in both marksmanship and tactics at least monthly (as should all SROs.) Schools with armed teachers and staff should advertise that fact to ensure that a potential shooter knows they will face armed opposition. That alone reduces the chances of an active shooter.

Only trained cool-headed individuals. Preferably people who have been in life or death situations, i.e., military vets, cops and yes, hunters. Those who know that once a round is fired there is no recall and no second chances to get it right. Others who can pass some kind of mental stress assessment, to show the ability to think under extreme pressure. In these cases, I think it can be a good idea. Children will not be traumatized and do not even need to know.

I think Deputy Chief Jim Dudley is drastically underestimating the intelligence and ability of those in our educational system. If we follow his line of thinking, teachers should not have to know how to use an AED or perform CPR because that is not why they came to school that day; perhaps they should “leave it to the professionals” and call the fire department. As a law enforcement officer of 38 years (36 years as a firearms instructor), and as a civilian CCW instructor, I must say that there are civilians out there who are more capable with firearms and utilize better critical thinking than some of our fellow officers. Deputy Chief Jim Dudley also fails to take into consideration that many veterans, some of whom have more combat and stress experience than some law enforcement officers, have gone into the field of education after serving our country in the military. The school districts that have looked at this concept do not lean toward “handing out firearms to every teacher to leave unattended in their purse.” These programs are voluntary and selective. He is correct that there are some teachers who should not be armed, but there certainly are some teachers (or administrators, custodians, librarians, school bus drivers, etc.) who could be armed and trained. When I taught in an urban school district here in Ohio (to supplement my police income and to give something back to the community), only the school district superintendent, assistant superintendent and the building principal knew I was a police officer and carrying a handgun concealed on my person. No one else knew or needed to know. Armed staff in an educational environment CAN be done safely.

I tend to agree with Joel for all the reasons he has brought up. First off, no teacher is being mandated to carry a gun. It will be a choice. Second, either training or some sort of certification would be required for them to carry. I’ve been in law enforcement for 40 years and we have all seen certain individuals who cause us to scratch our heads and wonder how they made it through all the testing, screening and training and are still wearing a badge. Third, the teacher may already have a background in firearms. I know of civilians who are impressive in what they know and the experience they have.

My first impression, after reading both sides of this debate, was unnerving to say the least. For a seasoned, experienced long-time law enforcement officer, and now educator, to bunch all educators together as inexperienced, inept, unpredictable and unwilling to have the mindset of being able to be trained to have access to a firearm in the classroom is very discouraging to me. My thoughts are, how many educators have prior experience with firearms? How many educators, male and female, are former law enforcement officers or have been in the military? How many have combat experience? How many are avid hunters that grew up handling firearms? How many are sport shooters, or just like guns? How many educators, if asked, would be willing to take training during the summer months to be able to have a gun in their possession during the school year? Has anyone asked that question or considered that as something possible to make schools safer? I’m sure the majority of educators don’t fit this profile, but I believe it to be one more option in protecting our schools. There are “Red Flag” laws in place. There are, literally, thousands of gun laws in place right now (not my opinion but easily checked with a little research). Have they stopped the plague of mass shootings so far? There have been 309 mass shootings in the United States so far this year! Several in schools and churches that are so-called “gun-free zones.” There definitely needs to be better security in our schools, but, there are a lot of choices on how to do that. In the Ulvade shooting, the intruder gained entrance through an unlocked side door. How does a school become so complacent that doors aren’t secured as a rule?

Can you really expect a teacher to go armed in a school that has to separate two kids yesterday, possibly have to hug one of them today and maybe have to shoot that same kid tomorrow or next week? They don’t have the experience built up inside from dealing with the public on a daily basis and possibly have hyper-vigilance to think ahead as to what might happen. The best idea is to have police academy-trained officers with the extra training for schools, know the layout, know the personnel and recognize the kids. The officers have to work and take orders from the department and police supervisors only and none of the school personnel. There has to be a separation of powers and supervisors for that job must be chosen for their comprehensive job performance and not their test score.

My opinion is that arming teachers is a good decision under the right conditions and stringent policy. I have experience with a rural school in our county that has done just this. The teachers are hand-picked by the superintendent and must undergo strict firearms and active shooter training by law enforcement (two weeks). Their identities are kept secret and known only to each other and the first responders in the county. There are mandatory training sessions in the summer during off times again with law enforcement. They also have completed joint training with law enforcement in their school for an active shooter. This negates Jim Dudley’s comment about doubting whether teachers are willing to go through the training and maintain it. Signs are posted at the drives to each school stating that it is a guardian school with armed teachers and they will take whatever action is necessary to protect the schools. There are schools and teachers out that that are serious about this and put in the training, work and policy to support it. Only schools with this level of commitment should move forward with such a policy.

A teacher’s responsibility is to ensure the safety of their students. I feel it is best that they are unarmed. However, administrators and other school personnel could be armed. They would need to be trained in the use of the firearms that they will carry. They should also be trained specifically in mass shooting events. They do not need to have training in other police matters as they would specifically respond only to mass shooting situations.

With the amount of firearm training we do in law enforcement, even our abilities are tested in UOF encounters. I can’t imagine the responsibility that could be shouldered by educators having to use a firearm in a critical and stressful event.

Any adult school staff member (teacher, admin, janitor, support staff, parent, etc.) who is willing and able (legally, mentally and physically) should be allowed and encouraged to be an armed good guy on campus. The idea of “gun-free zones” is insane because we end up with defenseless, criminal victimization zones. See John Lott’s “ More Guns, Less Crime

As a school security officer, a reserve deputy, a volunteer firefighter and a veteran of two combat deployments in the US Army, I would absolutely invite any teacher who is willing to be trained and carry the responsibility of protecting our students with a firearm. Not ALL teachers, but I do know of a few who would be more than capable and would gladly accept their assistance if our worst nightmare ever comes true.

As a 30-year veteran law enforcement officer of which part of my career was a D.A.R.E. officer, an SRO and a patrol captain, I have responded to two active school shootings. One was over before anyone arrived and had no SRO, the other was at my son’s school and was very much active when I arrived because we did not where the shooter was. There was a Sheriff’s Department SRO at my son’s school. but the shooter knew where he was and opened fire in a crowded commons area where the deputy wasn’t. Could an armed teacher have prevented either one? Maybe, maybe not. In both instances, the shooters who were both students had reason to believe no one at the time was going to shoot back. Both shooters had an abundance of ammo, one had multiple firearms. Both students choose to end the shooting on their own. One was disarmed by the principal when his first gun went empty after killing three and wounding five, the other disarmed himself after killing two and wounding 12 and then fled with other students before being pointed out and apprehended by law enforcement. The point is that criminals (murderers, shooters, whatever you want to call them) do NOT follow the rules, they are not bound by morals or ethics, or any reasonable standards at the time of their action. If someone is willing to die themselves there is not much you can do to prevent others from getting hurt. To quote the phrase, “a good defense is a good offense,” is understated in these situations. I AGREE to some extent with both arguments, HOWEVER, I wholeheartedly agree with giving teachers who are qualified, trained and willing to take responsibility for their actions the ability to carry a handgun if they want to. I saw teachers doing courageous things and taking care of wounded students while putting their lives in harm’s way! Please let us look at this as another tool in the toolbox to make our schools LESS of an easy target.

Thoughtful arguments were presented by both sides. With over 45 years of military/law enforcement experience including instructing in firearms and tactics, I continue to interface with law enforcement all over the US in providing training and consultation in reconstructing shooting events. Three points to consider: 1. No policy can create total immunity from a bad outcome. Some risk is inherent in any proactive prevention plan. 2. Armed teachers can be an effective part of that plan providing a viable chance for a good outcome, where there may otherwise be no such chance. 3. Schools are not monolithic. Policy must consider the unique makeup, nature, personalities and characteristics of the school community and tailor its program accordingly.

It simply is a math issue, average response time vs average time an active shooter event lasts. Without immediate responders on scene, there will be a large casualty count. We have been teaching the School Protection Officer program in Missouri for several years and I am a former police academy director so I am very aware of the training both groups receive. The SPO program is commensurate with LE academy firearms requirements. There are many people who are totally capable of being trained to protect students. Well-trained, vetted, ready willing and able, intervention-capable immediate responders are the answer to this math problem.

A one-size solution does not fit all school districts. Rural vs. urban systems are often staffed by teachers with disparate backgrounds and levels of experience with firearms. Geography also dictates response times; a large county in west Texas will likely have a longer response time than will a small district in the middle of NYC. Additionally, it is equally likely that more teachers in that Texas county have more experience with guns than might their NY counterparts. IMO, just as in most aspects of our shared profession, each jurisdiction must consider the best way to use available resources to address local needs. Just as the threats differ for each department, so do the solutions. We certainly should learn from each other, but ultimately must best serve our own citizens. No single nationwide answer will ever be appropriate to the tragedy of school shootings.

We already have the answer to this question: the State of Utah has permitted teachers to be armed for at least 15 years. To date, the only school “attack” has been an attempted bombing. Not knowing which and how many adults are armed in the school is the greatest deterrent, just like the greater number of people carrying concealed correlates to lower violent crime rates. There is no need for extensive training because we have to understand the context of the incident: one or more armed individuals shooting unarmed victims at their leisure. Videos of incidents show potential victims fleeing or going to ground. The shooters walk upright and don’t engage in tactical behavior. History has shown these suspects tend to suicide at the first hint of armed response. At least, the shooter will focus on the adult who is armed rather than children. And there is the Second Amendment right of bearing arms because, even if an SRO is somewhere in the school, the minutes it will take for the SRO and/or responding police will leave children and teachers defenseless. If any teacher or administrator wants to carry concealed, they should be permitted to do so.

I agree that there should be an opportunity for teachers and or staff to be trained properly. I am an SRO, patrol deputy and former US Marine and feel that if we can put the right people in these positions lives can be saved.

As the leader of our (School Security Group) here in our county and an LEO myself, I have the same mixed feelings about arming “carte blanche” anyone who is a teacher. Going back to the day I decided to enter law enforcement, my biology teacher was also a law enforcement officer. Would I feel totally comfortable with him carrying most definitely, would I feel the same about my government teacher at the time? No! This whole problem of active shooters has to be addressed on so many levels; from mental health care on down. A continued “threat assessment” evaluation process must be done on any individual meeting the profile.

I have been the criminal justice instructor at my local high school for 23 years, and am also a part-time police officer at the local community college. I have been a cop since 1972. By order of the principal, I do not carry at the high school, which I think is ridiculous. This is not a “one size fits all” issue, but there ARE people in education who would carry if allowed, and would do a very good job of protecting students. When we have the occasional “lockdown drills,” I have to just lock the classroom door and think about how I would protect my students if it were a real situation.

Armed police officers should be School Resource Officers assigned by a unit of the local police department and trained by them with daily briefings from cell phones, emails, or other optical messaging, so they can read it and keep a copy for reference. Reading it puts the message in your mind, being just told is less reliable. The unit should be governed by the PD, not by school personnel, so as not to cause conflict with supervisors. Officers should rotate through several schools. The unit should also be knowledgeable regarding the history of students, gangs, rivalries, and Facebook information, have access to dedicated computers, have building duty keys for access, and not allow school students or personnel family members without their personal knowledge to be on the property. Officers would be knowledgeable regarding suspensions, and problem areas like divorces and arrests. Teachers would be too close to students, breaking up fights and counseling students one day and be faced with possible altercations the next, without knowledge of incidents. Resource officers should have totally different command structures, separate from the Board of Education or school personnel.

By all means, arm the staff as a whole in schools. Train them and make sure there are rules in place to make sure guns are kept on their bodies and not accessible to students. At least these teachers would then have a fighting chance to defend themselves and their students rather than being defenseless sheep and sitting ducks ready for slaughter. Stop gun violence by being prepared to defend and take out any would-be attacker. I also vote for armed volunteers who have concealed carry permits to be trained to also patrol school grounds and property. Unfortunately, the police can not be everywhere at all times and response times are limited in many situations. Please, please, please give our educators a FIGHTING chance.

I am for arming trained teachers and staff. But I have a question, are we expecting the armed teachers and staff to be the SWAT team at the sound of gunfire running to it clearing rooms as they go or are we asking them to be prepared to use deadly force if it becomes necessary where they are at? The one thing teachers can do safely and the other is for highly trained LEOs.

The Texas Legislature passed a bill, signed by our Governor, that mandates every school in the state to have vetted, trained, armed personnel on every school campus. The state is also funding the program. I have 52 years of law enforcement experience in a large city department, a federal agency and a medium-sized county. For 32 years, I have been a firearms instructor (federal and state certified). Mr. Dudley makes assumptions that IMO are not backed up with facts. See Dr. John Lott’s research. I agree that not every school employee would be capable or have the mindset to be armed. That being said, during my tenure, I have observed many LEOs who had/have no business being armed (Parkland and Uvalde). I believe our school marshal and guardian programs will save lives.

Teachers should be allowed the opportunity to carry a firearm, but not necessarily expected to. Right now, schools are “gun-free zones” and any teacher who is a law-abiding citizen won’t carry, even if they have the correct mindset to do so. Allowing those who choose to conceal carry to do so within a school instantly makes the school a harder target. Anyone considering a mass shooting is less likely to do so if they know they will be met with the same force that they’re bringing, or rather don’t know when/where that force will be coming from if they don’t hear sirens first. I’m not suggesting that all teachers should be armed, rather if they have the predisposition to carry otherwise, allow them the opportunity to do so in the school. Imagine a school shooting where instead of a classroom of students hiding behind a teacher armed only with a textbook vs. a shooting where those same students were behind a teacher armed with a firearm. I think this is an ounce of prevention that can/should be utilized that people aren’t using.

Qualified, vetted and trained teachers who VOLUNTEER to do so should be an active part of any school’s in-house defense against violent offenders.

With 20 years of medical experience, the Franklin doctor knew an abortion would be the best medical treatment for her patient. If she delayed, the mother would be at risk for severe bleeding, infection, multi-system organ failure and possibly death.

""For this woman, the best medical decision was an abortion,"" Andreson said.

But under Tennessee's new abortion ban, officially in effect as of Thursday, Andreson fears she would risk a felony charge for providing that medical treatment in the future.

""Sadly, the termination of a pregnancy will put me at risk of being charged with a felony,"" she said.

Abortion:Here's what Tennessee's new, near-total abortion ban actually says as it goes into effect

Andreson on Thursday joined a group of Tennessee doctors protesting the new law, which criminalizes abortions. Doctors could face felony charges and prison time under the new statute, though pregnant patients are not criminally liable under the law.

The law has no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, nor does it have a legal exception for abortions performed to prevent the severe injury or death of a pregnant patient.

Criminal defense attorneys and doctors like Andreson say Tennessee physicians could now possibly face arrest and criminal charges for performing any abortion for any reason in the state, even if the patient is in grave danger.

The new law provides an ""affirmative defense"" clause, through which an abortion provider could defend the procedure if the pregnant patient was in danger of dying or debilitating injury. But the defense would come after criminal felony charges.

""How sick does a woman need to be to provide enough evidence for me to develop my affirmative defense?"" Andreson asked Thursday.

""To everyone listening: This law is dangerous to the women of Tennessee. Whatever your opinion is on abortion, please realize that these government mandates pose a significant threat to our health and many are downplaying these risks.""

Lee, anti-abortion groups say law shields doctors, but no exceptions exist

In two public appearances this week, Gov. Bill Lee contended the law was designed to allow doctors to perform abortions during medical emergencies threatening a mother's life.

""Our law is designed to allow for doctors to perform procedures in dangerous maternal health situations where the life of the mother is at stake,"" Lee told reporters in Memphis on Wednesday. ""That is how that bill was constructed. It protects the life of the unborn. It protects the life of the mother.""

Gov. Bill Lee:Lee says abortion law protects doctors in severe cases. Critics say it's not so clear.

Lee doesn't outright mention legal exceptions, which are prevalent in other strict anti-abortion bans across the U.S. and protect doctors from criminal liability under criminal law.

The affirmative defense clause in Tennessee's law does not protect doctors from criminal liability, but rather gives them an avenue to defend their medical practice once accused of a crime.

""Doctors should not be criminals for saving a pregnant woman's life and helping a woman in her time of need,"" Nashville Dr. Amy Gordon Bono said. ""Our legislation is Tennessee is inhumane and insensitive to the complexities that patients and physicians encounter every day. Compassionate healthcare exists in a lot of gray areas.""

Strict new law passed in 2019

Tennessee Republicans passed the Human Life Protection Act in 2019, which was signed into law by Lee but quickly blocked by federal courts upon its passage. The U.S. Supreme Court decision this June to overturn constitutional access to abortion care triggered the law to take effect on Aug. 25.

Sexual assault survivor and child advocacy groups have already begun planning a lobbying push for specific exceptions for rape and incest, which cannot be considered until the General Assembly returns to session next year.

Abortion:Advocates plan push for change to Tennessee abortion law with zero exceptions

Anti-abortion group Tennessee Right to Life, a major architect of the 2019 law, lauded the law on Thursday.

“The right to life is the most fundamental right of any human being. To protect that right for our unborn children is a responsibility that we take seriously. Tennesseans should be proud of what our state has accomplished for our most vulnerable citizens,” Stacy Dunn, president of Tennessee Right to Life, said in a release.

https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amber-heard-asks-court-toss-10m-verdict-johnny-depp-defamation-case,Amber Heard asks court to toss $10M verdict in Johnny Depp defamation case,"Amber Heard asked a judge Friday to toss the verdict against her – arguing that the $10.35 million judgment in favor of Johnny Depp wasn't supported by the evidence presented during the sensational six-week trial.

In a 43-page motion, Heard's lawyers Elaine Bredehoft and Ben Rottenborn argued that Judge Penney Azcarate should throw out the judgment and dismiss the complaint in Fairfax County District Court in Virginia.

""The verdict is excessive as a matter of law in light of the evidence and law, and should be set aside,"" they wrote.

A jury awarded Depp a $10.35 million finding that his 36-year-old ex-wife had defamed him and caused him to lose business opportunities by penning a 2018 op-ed in the Washington Post calling herself a ""public figure representing domestic abuse.""

JOHNNY DEPP VERDICT: ACTOR WINS DEFAMATION CASE AGAINST EX-WIFE AMBER HEARD

He made claims that three statements in the op-ed were defamatory – including the headline referring to Heard as a survivor of sexual assault.

Heard countersued Depp, 59, and won $2 million on her claim that a statement made by his attorney, Adam Waldman, to the press calling her allegations a ""hoax"" was libelous.

The latest motion from Heard's team alleges that Depp failed to prove that the op-ed cost the actor his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" six, noting that a contract had not been signed.

""Mr. Depp presented no evidence of any pecuniary damages suffered,"" wrote lawyers for the ""Aquaman"" actress.

AMBER HEARD IS OFFICIALLY ON THE HOOK FOR $10.35 MILLION AFTER JUDGMENT ENTERED

In addition, the attorneys argued that Depp inappropriately broadened the period of the damages to stretch back six years. The trial was supposed to focus on Dec. 18, 2018 – when the op-ed was published – to Nov. 2, 2020, they wrote.

But, in the case presented to the jury, Depp's lawyers went back to the restraining order that Heard filed on May 27, 2016, accusing him of bashing her in the face with a cellphone, which launched the warring exes' years-long public battle.

Meanwhile, Azcarate barred jurors from hearing that a UK judge had substantiated 12 acts of domestic violence against Heard in 2020, after a highly publicized London defamation trial. Depp had sued the publisher of The Sun newspaper for branding him a wife beater and lost.

JOHNNY DEPP MAY TESTIFY AT LA TRIAL FOR ALLEGEDLY SLUGGING FILM SET WORKER

""The exclusion of the UK Judgement, coupled with Mr. Depp's continuous urging to the jury to go back six years and exonerate him and restore his reputation, resulted in an indefensible $10 million compensatory damage verdict and a $5 million punitive damage verdict,"" wrote the lawyers.

Azcarate reduced the punitive damages award to $350,000 – the maximum under Virginia law.

The motion also argued that Depp failed to prove ""actual malice,"" namely that Heard did not believe or had serious doubts that her ex-husband had abused her when the op-ed was published.

The filing largely rehashed the defense case that Heard's team presented at trial, which the jury rejected. Heard has said she plans to appeal, and the latest submission is the first step in that process.

Amtrak, which was operating the train Monday when three passengers were killed and more than 100 injured, and BNSF, which owns the tracks, sued MS Contracting on Thursday, blaming the company and its deceased driver, Billy Dean Barton II, for “negligently, carelessly, and recklessly” operating the 2007 Kenworth dump truck that was hauling rock for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Despite the “clearly visible approaching Amtrak Train 4, Barton failed to yield the right of way . . . and instead attempted to cross the grade crossing which resulted in a collision,” according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missouri.

But a lawsuit filed by Erin Barton, the truck driver’s widow, alleges that BNSF and Chariton County, where the collision occurred, were negligent.

“BNSF was actually warned by concerned citizens of the ultra-hazardous nature of the crossing; yet it sat on its hands and failed to make sure the grade crossing was in proper condition or had active warnings to prevent this horrific crash,” said the lawsuit, filed this week in Chariton County Circuit Court.

The suit also alleges that the county was negligent in designing and maintaining the road leading to the crossing, and that the road did not follow engineering standards for such crossings.

BNSF, county officials and Amtrak declined to comment. MS Contracting did not answer calls seeking comment.

The speed limit along that stretch of track near Mendon was 90 mph. The National Transportation Safety Board said the Amtrak train, which was headed from Los Angeles to Chicago, had been traveling at 87 miles per hour.

2 officers killed while trying to serve warrant

Two law enforcement officers were killed and five were injured when a man opened fire on police attempting to serve a warrant at a home in eastern Kentucky on Thursday night, authorities said.

Police took Lance Storz, 49, into custody late Thursday night.

An emergency management official was also injured and a police K-9 dog was killed, according to the arrest citation.

The responding officers encountered “pure hell” when they arrived on the scene, Floyd County Sheriff John Hunt told reporters Friday afternoon.

Hunt said four deputies initially responded, and then called for backup when shots were fired at them. The officers at the scene were under fire for hours, Hunt said. He said Storz surrendered after negotiations that included Storz’s family members.

Storz used a rifle to fire multiple rounds at officers around his residence on Main Street in Allen, Ky., the citation said.

Kentucky State Police were called to the scene at 6:30 p.m., joining local officers already on the scene.

Storz was arraigned Friday morning by a judge in Pike County. He pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder of a police officer and was jailed on a $10 million bond. One of the charges was originally attempted murder of a police officer, but a judge said at the hearing that was upgraded to murder. He is also facing another attempted murder charge and assault on a service animal.

Hunt said one of his deputies, William Petry, and Prestonsburg Police Capt. Ralph Frasure were killed in the shooting incident. Frasure worked for 39 years in law enforcement in Floyd County. Another Prestonsburg officer, Jacob Chaffins, is currently hospitalized, Prestonsburg Mayor Les Stapleton said in a social media post.

The message only alluded to ""circumstances beyond our control"" for the cancellation, but a Billboard report claims the ""likely cause"" is Georgia's gun laws, which make it illegal for Music Midtown to bar attendees from bringing guns onto publically owned land like the festival grounds of Piedmont Park.

Georgia's ""Safe Carry Protection Act"" was passed in 2014 and allowed citizens of the state to bring guns into places like schools, churches, and bars. It was expanded in a 2019 court ruling by the Georgia Supreme Court. While certain businesses on public land with ""long-term leases"" are allowed to ban guns, brief events like Music Midtown are not.

The Georgia Supreme Court ruling would have allowed gun owners who were denied entry to the festival over their firearms to sue the event. Billboard reports that in the lead-up to the festival, Midtown was assailed on social media with legal threats by pro-gun groups and their supporters.

The concert, which featured headliners Future, My Chemical Romance, Jack White and Fallout Boy, was called off via a statement issued by festival organizers.

“There was a lot of digging into archives at presidential libraries and personal paper collections,” he says. “There was a lot of prying involved in getting people to talk because this is a subject that, as you can imagine, even today, some people were hesitant to speak about it.”

“No greater secret”

Kirchick says antagonism toward gay people in D.C. surfaced after World War II, when the U.S. became a world superpower and built its national security force.

“Secrecy had not really been a concern in Washington. … And now all of a sudden it is, and there is no greater secret, more shameful secret than that one is a homosexual,” Kirchick says. “And so it is believed that homosexuals are therefore more liable, more susceptible to blackmail. That they will do anything, including betray their country, to protect this deeply shameful secret.”

After the onset of the Cold War, Joseph McCarthy made his infamous speech alleging that he had a list of 205 communists in the U.S. State Department. At the time, a State Department official acknowledged that 91 homosexuals were fired from the unit. As a result, Kirchick says homosexuality, communism, and treason all become interconnected in the public eye.

The impact of gay people on presidents’ careers

During the 1940s, journalist Whittaker Chambers accused State Department official Alger Hiss of being a communist. The investigation was featured in the first televised congressional hearing in the U.S. in 1948.

Hiss was a homosexual, and Kirchick says the FBI used that information against Chambers.

“They started a whisper campaign that Chambers [was] lying. And the reason he's lying about Hiss being a communist spy is because Chambers is a spurned and vindictive homosexual, that he had lusted after Hiss, and Hiss had rejected him.”

Among the congressmen taking part in the trial was a young Richard Nixon, who Kirchick describes as a “champion of Chambers.”

“This is really what makes Nixon into a national figure. He's just a junior freshman congressman, and he's sitting on the U.S. committee, and this is what really elevates him to the point where just a couple of years later, Dwight Eisenhower picks him to be his vice presidential running mate.”

In April 1953, Eisenhower signed executive order 10450, which listed “sexual perversion” as a reason to be disqualified for a government job and denied access to security clearances.

Kirchick says once Nixon became president in 1969, he was obsessed with homosexuality. That was due in part to the Chambers’ case, his belief that the State Department official wasn’t a communist, and that Chambers and Hiss had been lovers.

Nixon also added homosexuals to the list of individuals he was paranoid over, the author says.

“He saw enemies lurking everywhere. … Homosexuality becomes one of these bogeymen for him alongside radicals and Jews and Blacks — there's this long list of enemies, groups of people. … He was excellent in mobilizing these resentments.”

At the same time, Kirchick says Nixon’s chief speechwriter was Ray Price, who was a gay man, and it was part of a cognitive dissonance that existed among many Washington politicians.

“It's a recurring theme in this book that these presidents — they're able to have close gay friends or gay advisors who play crucial roles in their political careers. And yet, at the same time, it has no bearing whatsoever on the policies that … their administration's pursued, as they were the most powerful [men] in the country.”

Reagan’s gay admnistration

Many of former President Ronald Reagan’s administration were gay men, Kirchick says. Many of Nancy Reagan’s friends were also gay. While the couple wasn’t totally fine with queerness, Kirchick says they were most comfortable around gay people than most Americans, and especially conservative, politicians. President Reagan also defeated a 1978 ballot initiative that would have banned gay people from teaching in public schools.

But after gaining the support of Christian evangelicals, who can be anti-gay, Reagan stepped away from his public support of the community. Months into his presidency, the AIDS crisis hit, and he took four years to address the disease. Reagan was also friends with actor Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS. But after his death, Reagan shied away from sharing his full feelings in a public statement.

“It says: ‘Nancy and I are profoundly sad’ and profoundly is crossed out in Reagan's handwriting. The sentence, ‘Our memories will be of his humanity’ … changed to ‘He will be remembered for his humanity.’ It's changed in the passive voice. Then this entire sentence — ‘He was our friend, and we will miss him greatly’ — is crossed out. So it's a very meticulous, concerted, deliberate attempt to distance themselves from this man.”

What drew gay men to Washington

“Being a bachelor was a somewhat easier status to maintain, and you might draw less attention to yourself as a bachelor in Washington than you might in other cities, certainly in the small towns and many gay people were fleeing,” Kirchick explains.

In 1975, the U.S. Civil Service lifted the ban on gay people. Then in 1995, the ban on giving gay people security clearances was lifted.

“The official secrecy that was imposed upon gay people, by force of law, it comes to an end in 1995,” Kirchick says. “That's not to say that the closet disappears. That's not to say that homosexuality as an issue disappears. Obviously, the gay rights struggle would go on for years. But in terms of the scope of the book, in terms of what I call the ‘specter of homosexuality’ reigning over Washington, it really comes to an end in the middle of the 1990s.”",Q3

The historic civil judgment, handed down last week by a federal magistrate judge in Philadelphia, is the latest in a series of court actions that seek to hold accountable accused Liberian war criminals, several of whom resettled in southeastern Pennsylvania as refugees in the ’90s and early 2000s.

Moses Thomas, 68, was working at the now closed southwest Philadelphia dining spot Klade’s when he was first identified in a 2018 lawsuit as the military commander who led the slaughter at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Monrovia — an episode that the U.S. State Department has identified as one of the “worst single episodes” of the gruesome multi-factioned ethnic conflict that left more than 200,000 civilians dead between 1989 and 1997.

“Although no amount of damages will provide adequate redress for what [the victims] have suffered,” U.S. Magistrate Judge Lynne A. Sitarski wrote in her Aug. 16 order, “a substantial award could have some deterrent effect on future would-be human rights abusers.”

Thomas, however, remained unrepentant.

He fled back to Liberia after he was outed by the lawsuit to avoid the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts. Reached there by phone on Monday, he dismissed the court order as “stupidity” but otherwise declined to comment.

“Let them go to hell and kiss my ass,” he told the West Africa Reporting Project on Saturday. “To hell with their decision and everything! . . . You think I have time for corrupt judges who make stupid decisions without any evidence?”

Because he is no longer in the United States, it is unlikely that Thomas will ever be forced to pay his victims. Still, the judgment Sitarski entered against him was significant.

It is only the second time a U.S. court has awarded damages to Liberian civil war victims under the 1992 Torture Victims Protection Act, a law that allows foreigners to pursue civil claims for torture and extrajudicial killings against people living the U.S.

‘Everyone is dead’

The civil suit that prompted the ruling did not specifically accuse Thomas of killing anyone at the St. Peter’s Lutheran Church.

Instead, one of the plaintiffs and two former members of the Armed Forces of Liberia who served as witnesses in the case said they saw him standing outside the gates to the church directing the soldiers who opened fire.

At the time, Thomas was a commander in the army’s Special Anti-Terrorist Unit, the elite special forces team that served as the personal guard for then-Liberian President Samuel Doe. By the summer of 1990, Doe’s forces were under siege in Monrovia, surrounded by rebel forces under the command of Charles Taylor, who would go on to succeed Doe in the presidency.

Doe believed the population of ethnic Mano and Gio people in Monrovia was more loyal to the invading army than his own. And hoping to root out spies and potential rebels, Thomas’ unit was dispatched to pull Manos and Gios from their homes, haul them off to detention centers or execute and decapitate them in the streets.

The chaos prompted several families to flee to shelters like St. Peter’s Lutheran.

Thomas, according to the lawsuit, stopped by the church compound in the days before the massacre to promise the roughly 2,000 people inside his protection. Yet on the night of July 29, the court found, he ordered 45 government soldiers to kill everyone in the building.

Mothers saw their children shot down among the pews. Men watched in horror as their brothers were hacked to death by machete-wielding soldiers. Bodies filled the nave, left to rot in the aftermath until volunteers eventually buried the corpses two months later.

The plaintiffs — who filed their case under pseudonyms for fear of retaliation in Liberia — described the harrowing aftermath in declarations submitted the court.

They survived by hiding under bodies as soldiers fired their weapons indiscriminately and stabbed at corpses with machetes and bayonets to ensure everyone inside the church was dead.

“It was mayhem,” said one, who described cowering in the church’s pulpit clutching a Bible to his chest. “People started running around chaotically. . . . They shot everyone trying to escape.”

Another plaintiff described waiting until hours after the soldiers had left before she dared try to climb out from under the crush of corpses that had buried her.

“I waited on the floor, under the fallen bodies and soaked in others’ blood,” she said. “There were so many bodies, I could not see the floor. I did not see any other survivors.”

After an hour, other witnesses said in sworn affidavits, Thomas ended the assault with a single command: “Everyone is dead. All soldiers out.”

Nearly three decades later, Thomas scoffed at the lawsuit’s effort to blame him for the Lutheran church attack during an interview with The Inquirer.

He insisted that he never left the presidential palace on the day of the massacre and that he and his unit had provided protection for the survivors afterward.

He maintained that he, too, later became a victim of persecution after Doe was beheaded in the streets of Monrovia and Taylor was elected president seven years later.

Thomas was granted temporary protected status as a refugee and fled to the U.S. in 2000.

A record of impunity

Though Thomas, now believed to be living in Monrovia, may have escaped the reach of the U.S. courts, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the ruling should send a strong message to the Liberian government that he should be criminally prosecuted by courts in that country.

“For our clients, their priority has been investigating the truth of what happened to them and their loved ones,” said Nushin Sarakati, a staff attorney at the Center for Justice and Accountability, which represented the Liberians in their suit. “This is a very serious crime that still needs investigating and still needs accountability for these victims.”

Prospects for that outcome, however, remain dim.

To date, the Liberian government has yet to hold anyone responsible for the dozens of documented atrocities committed on all sides of the civil war.

In that absence, U.S. authorities have led the charge in recent years to hold Liberian war criminals to account — particularly in Philadelphia, where federal prosecutors have won criminal convictions against two high-level leaders from opposite sides of the war in recent years.

In 2018, a federal judge sentenced Mohammed Jabateh, of Lansdowne to 30 years in prison for hiding his past as a brutal warlord who engaged in acts of murder, sexual violence and cannibalism under the nom de guerre “Jungle Jabbah.”

That same year, a jury convicted Jucontee Thomas Woewiyu — Taylor’s former spokesperson — for lying to U.S. immigration authorities about his complicity in war crimes committed by Taylor’s regime. He died from complications stemming from the coronavirus in 2020 before he could be sentenced.

Prosecutors secured indictments against two other Liberian nationals living in Philadelphia earlier this year: Moses Slanger Wright, a 69-year-old former commanding general in Doe’s army, and Laye Sekou Camara, 43, a former rebel commander fought under the name “Dragon Master” and allegedly committed war crimes during Liberia’s second civil war between 1999 and 2003. They’re set to face trial next year.

But unlike those four men — all of whom were prosecuted not for the atrocities they committed but for later lying about them to immigration authorities — Thomas never sought permanent residency or U.S. citizenship and therefore could not be criminally prosecuted under the same immigration laws.

Still, his victims said the U.S. court’s ruling in their civil case gave them something they’d been denied by their own government for decades — acknowledgment of what they’d survived.

“It’s very difficult for me to remember about these events, because it makes me feel terrible,” said one of the plaintiffs in a statement circulated by his attorneys. “But I joined this case and am speaking out now because I know what Moses Thomas did was wrong, and I want to bring him to justice. I want him to be held accountable for what he did to me and so many others at the Lutheran Church.”",Q3

The city is developing off-site parking and shuttle service plans that will accommodate those wishing to honor the four-year officer who died Sept. 18, 17 days after she was taken off life support. Burton, 28, was shot in the head Aug. 10 during a traffic stop.

She will lie in state inside the Richmond Municipal Building, 50 N. Fifth St., for public viewing from 2 to 7 p.m. Sunday. Burton's funeral will be at 11 a.m. Monday inside Richmond High School's Tiernan Center, 380 Hub Etchison Parkway. After the funeral, a procession will escort Burton to Indianapolis' Crown Hill Cemetery, where she will be interred in a section labeled Heroes of Public Safety.

“Please understand we are expecting a high volume of law enforcement and civilian guests from around the country,” Mayor Dave Snow said in a social media video addressing the city's plans.

Parking and shuttles provide the key to handling the crowds.

""This additional parking and free shuttle service will allow everyone an opportunity to pay respects to our fallen hero and her family,"" Snow said in the video.

Parking and shuttle maps will are being posted on a special page linked from the city website's home page at richmondindiana.gov.

The plans for Sunday's viewing limit city building parking to first responders only. Free shuttle services using school buses will be available from these parking areas:

WellCare Community Health lot, 203 E. Main St.;

Wayne County Health Department log, 100 S. Fifth St.;

Wayne Bank lot, 500 S. A St.;

Lot behind the former Elder-Beerman, 601 E. Main St.;

City parking garage, 20 S. Eighth St.; and

City parking lot, 100 S. 10th St.

In addition, accessibility parking with shuttle service using paratransit buses will be available at Dennis Middle School, 222 N.W. Seventh St., for anyone who cannot enter a standard school bus.

For Monday's funeral, Hub Etchison Parkway and other roads around Richmond High School will be closed, including the G Street Bridge. Law enforcement vehicles will stage on Hub Etchison for the procession to Indianapolis that follows the service. Officers have been asked to begin arriving at 8:30 a.m.

Members of the public are invited to join the procession to Crown Hill Cemetery. Those people should head south to Hub Etchison Parkway and receive direction on where to park.

Anyone not traveling to Indianapolis should either park and walk or use parking lots with shuttle service. Shuttle service will begin at 9 a.m. Monday and will drop riders off in front of Tiernan Center. Shuttles will not resume after the service until the procession has left the high school. That means it could take an hour or two after the service to return to the parking lots.

The lots offering shuttles are:

City parking lot, 100 S. 10th St.;

Reid Health's PACE Center lot, 2300 National Road W.; and

Cordell Municipal Pool, 9 S.W. 13th St.

In addition, Dennis Middle School will again be used for those with mobility issues who need paratransit buses for transportation.

The funeral begins at 11 a.m. with law enforcement officers in attendance walking past Burton's casket. That is expected to take about an hour. The service, which will have seven speakers, is expected to last until about 1:30 p.m., with the procession leaving approximately 2:30 p.m.

The procession to Indianapolis will cross the G Street Bridge, then turn left onto South Fifth Street. It will follow South Fifth to the city building, which houses the police department, and pause for a final 10-42 call indicating end of watch.

The procession will turn onto North A Street, curving around the city building to East Main Street. After turning right onto East Main, it will pass under a garrison flag at First and West Main streets.

After passing beneath the flag, the procession will continue to South West Fifth Street, turning left toward U.S. 40. After turning right onto U.S. 40, it will follow U.S. 40 all the way to Illinois Street in Indianapolis, turning right onto Illinois Street and proceeding to 34th Street. A left turn onto 34th Street takes the procession to the Crown Hill Cemetery entrance.

The procession is expected to take three to three-and-a-half hours to reach the cemetery, where there will be a committal service. Members of the public are invited to safely line the procession route and pay tribute to Burton.

Gov. Eric J. Holcomb on Friday directed flags in the state of Indiana to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset Monday in Burton's honor. Businesses and residents are asked to comply.",Q3
https://www.yesmagazine.org/opinion/2022/09/14/accent-bias-english,Accent Bias and the Myth of Comprehensibility,"Accent bias is ubiquitous in the United States, where English is considered the universal language and, even more so, a social currency.

Earlier this year, I was at a high-end store in Greenwich, Connecticut, and as I was shopping, a salesperson approached me, offering her help. She was curious to know where I was from. “New York,” I replied.

Not surprisingly, she followed up with, “Where are you from, originally?”

“Pakistan,” I responded.

“How long has it been since you moved to the U.S.?” she inquired. “Almost two decades,” I promptly replied.

But what came next was somewhat unexpected, as she said, “Oh, but that accent is still there.”

I smiled politely, we exchanged some more pleasantries, and I made my way out of the store.

As I walked out, I kept thinking, “Do accents have an expiration date?” Would she have said the same to someone with a French or a British accent? Perhaps, but I will never know for sure. Based on my past experiences, I imagine the conversation would have gone differently had I been European. The salesperson would have offered a mix of admiration and fascination rather than a snarky remark.

The incident raised many emotions within me, such as anger and frustration about how different accents are perceived in American social discourse and how people who don’t have “acceptable” or “familiar” accents when speaking English are viewed and treated with a certain degree of otherness.

English: The Colonizer’s Language

Accent bias is ubiquitous in the United States, where English is considered the universal language and, even more so, a social currency. Speaking English has become synonymous with cognitive excellence, conferring a certain degree of global linguistic clout upon the user.

Perhaps this phenomenon may be traced back to British colonialism and White supremacy—in the U.S. and worldwide. British colonizers not only looted and plundered other nations but also imposed their culture and language on Indigenous populations. Hence, English became a marker of class, etiquette, success, and higher intellect and a rite of passage for people who wanted proximity to colonial power.

Even today, Pakistan has two official languages, English and Urdu. English, or as I have come to call it, “the colonizer’s language,” is also widely spoken in India and other parts of the world that were once colonies of the British empire.

The legacy of language is visible in the class divisions of the formerly colonized. People from the upper echelons of society are conditioned to speak “proper” English because, for them, the command of the language sets them apart from the masses.

The Brigham Young University undergraduate school of psychology published a study in 2007 suggesting that accents impact people’s perceptions of intelligence, physical attraction, and trustworthiness. Hearing someone talk with an accent originating from a non-European country invokes unfounded assumptions about their cognitive capabilities.

In most instances, the default is to assume that someone who speaks English with a non-Western accent is somehow less intelligent. As a result, there are profound economic implications. According to studies, people often miss jobs, housing, and other opportunities because of their accents. In addition, people who do not enunciate words according to American conventions are not considered dynamic, innovative, or worthy of a particular employment.

Some Foreign Accents Are Admired, Others Are Not

Sadly, accent bias and discrimination are normalized in American society and even justified under the pretext that it is difficult to comprehend someone’s conversation if they speak with a non-European accent. I have often heard people complain that they cannot fully understand someone’s accent because of how they enunciate words, which can be frustrating for the listener. While this may sometimes be true, it’s baffling that Europeans, like French and German people, may speak English with thick accents that are objects of admiration in pop culture and the media.

There seems to be an implicit ranking or “accent hierarchy” in the U.S. From years of living as an immigrant in the U.S., I notice that British accents are seen as the most superior of foreign accents, while African and Eastern accents are at the bottom, with over-sexualized Latin American accents somewhere in the middle.

For instance, in an episode of the Apple TV program Loot, Olivier Martinez plays Jean-Pierre, a French billionaire and love interest for an American woman named Molly, played by Maya Rudolph. Most characters in the episode are shown fawning over his French accent.

Conversely, non-European accents are ridiculed at the expense of the communities they are assumed to represent. One of the guests on my podcast Immigrantly, Hari Kondabolu, a comedian, writer, podcaster, and filmmaker, made a documentary in 2017 titled The Problem with Apu in which he called out The Simpsons for its controversial portrayal of Indians. Apu, a South Asian character on the show, is voiced by Hank Azaria, a White actor who seems to have a warped understanding of an Indian accent.

Accents are not universal. Even in this country, English sounds and words are spoken differently across regions and boroughs. Not only are accents affected by geography, but they may also be based on people’s education, socio-economic status, and grasp of other languages. Hence, there is no such thing as a definitive Indian or Pakistani accent. Yet Apu’s etched character crafted a particular image of how an average Indian immigrant speaks English. Azaria’s portrayal invited viewers to laugh at him rather than with him.

Normalizing Diverse Accents

Even though the salesperson in Greenwich noticed I spoke as though I was born outside the U.S., my Pakistani accent is not as apparent as the foreign-sounding accents of other immigrants. I grew up in an upper-middle-class household in Pakistan and had access to world-class education and private schools. I learned English early in life, so I am confident in my language skills. Yet occasionally, I am reminded that my accent differs from the mainstream in not-so-endearing ways.

It is crucial that non-native English speakers should not be obligated to speak English a certain way or have their speaking style reflect their intelligence. On the contrary, those who speak with unconventional accents probably know a second language, suggesting they are resilient, intelligent, and have navigated multiple cultures. Further, if a non-native speaker can speak English fluently, their country of origin was likely colonized, forcing native people to learn and adapt to a language that isn’t theirs.

Expecting people to speak a language in a specific way is more indicative of a colonial mindset and less of the speaker’s ability to utilize and comprehend English. Moreover, every accent is unique and tells a story about someone’s lived experience. A person with an accent from a non-European nation deserves admiration for their mastery of another language.

To normalize unfamiliar, non-European accents in American society, we need to start by employing people in the workplace based on their skills rather than accents. While some may argue that comprehensibility is a central issue in the workplace, another perspective is that humans have an innate ability to adapt: The more we listen to various accents, the more we learn to understand and appreciate them. Additionally, DEI initiatives can include training on how to acclimate Americans to different accents.

Hollywood can also take steps to normalize non-mainstream accents. Other than actors like Salma Hayek, Gal Gadot, and Sofía Vergara, there are few on-screen stars who have foreign-sounding accents. Hollywood can and should portray characters with strong accents—not as caricatures but as central three-dimensional characters. And most importantly, White actors should never play characters of color!

The news media bears similar responsibility. While NPR boasts of journalists from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, such as Leila Fadel, Ailsa Chang, and Ramtin Arablouei, it is rare to hear a host with a non-mainstream accent on the platform. While comprehensibility may be the pretext for such bias in audio journalism, if platforms like NPR hire more hosts with diverse backgrounds, listeners will likely get used to hearing intelligent, dynamic people with various accents.

Lastly, the podcasting industry can play an instrumental role in being more inclusive and fairer in promoting accent diversity. Since podcasting is an intimate, personal audio space, it allows people to learn and unlearn privately in their own time without any judgment.

Before I launched my podcast, Immigrantly, three years ago, a few people suggested that listeners would not be able to comprehend my “thick accent” and that since podcasting is an audio medium, I should rethink the idea of hosting a podcast. I am glad I persevered, and through my podcast, I hope to expand people’s expectations of different accents.

Six multi-level units caught fire near the southwest corner of Interstate 30 and FM 551 in Fate around 5:30 a.m.

The flames could be seen from miles away and quickly consumed the partially complete structures. Four buildings were completely destroyed and two more were damaged.

Firefighters from several cities took a defensive position and used water cannons to try to protect nearby homes and businesses, including the FRESH by Brookshire's grocery store.

""We tried standing by that fence over there but the heat was so unbearable we couldn't stand close to it,"" said Duane Drost, who lives nearby. ""We had embers flying. We tried to keep the grass wet, back of the house covered to make sure our houses didn't catch fire.""

Drost said firefighters told him and other homeowners to be prepared to evacuate. Fortunately, he never had to.

Fate officials said some homes in the Williamsburg area to the south and west of the construction site were evacuated. Those residents have since been allowed to return.

It’s not yet clear what started the blaze. The Fate fire chief said it’s possible a grass fire could have spread to the construction site.

No construction workers were there at the time and no firefighters were seriously hurt.

One firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion and dehydration but is expected to be okay, Fate officials said.",Q3

Ahkeem Chase and Latrell Fleming, both 18, are facing murder, manslaughter, robbery and weapon possession charges for the Saturday night slaying in Hunts Point. They were arrested about 8 a.m. Tuesday.

The teens are accused of confronting Jose Alvarado as the Fordham Heights resident walked to his parked Mercedes-Benz on Hunts Point Ave. near Longfellow Ave. about 11:55 p.m.

Surveillance footage obtained by the Daily News shows the carjackers driving off in the luxury car, leaving Alvarado dying on the pavement.

https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/what-is-drag-queen-story-hour-and-why-are-the-events-under-attack/,What is Drag Queen Story Hour and why are the events under attack?,"Children’s storytime sessions led by drag queens are growing in popularity in countries from the United States to Japan – while fierce opposition campaigns are also gathering pace.

Drag Queen Story Hour events aim to introduce children to diverse role models and LGBTQ+ people. Critics say they sexualise and confuse young audiences, claims which have been strongly rebutted by organisers.

With protesters picketing events, some in Britain and the United States have had to bring in extra security or have been cancelled altogether.

Here’s all the details:

What is a Drag Queen Story Hour?

Drag queen performers read children’s books to young audiences and their families. The books that are read sometimes also feature LGBTQ+ characters.

The events – usually hosted at public libraries and bookshops – are typically aimed at children aged between three and 11.

The first event was founded in San Francisco by LGBTQ+ author and activist Michelle Tea in 2015. Tea has said she came up with the concept as a child-friendly way to introduce her young son to LGBTQ+ culture.

“Children love larger than life, magical characters, and drag queens have the biggest hearts and most creative minds,” Tea told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The events have since spread across the United States and to countries including Britain, Sweden, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Each local or national chapter is individually managed and funded.

What’s the criticism?

Drag storytimes have drawn protests, while several Republican politicians in the United States have pledged to take action to prevent them altogether.

Critics say that drag acts are inherently sexual, and that nursery and primary school-aged children are too young to be introduced to LGBTQ+ topics.

Some of the protests have been linked with far-right political groups, such as the Proud Boys, and Gays Against Groomers, which opposes what it describes as the “sexualisation” of children and trans healthcare for minors.

In Britain, demonstrations against the readings are largely organised and supported by far-right nationalist groups Independent Nationalist Network (INN) and the Patriotic Alternative.

“For most parents … the one wish they have for their children is to preserve their innocence,” said one flyer opposing drag storytime events, distributed by INN.

“Anything that is sexualised is a threat and direct danger to that.”

In 2019, a drag queen who took part in a storytime event in Houston, Texas, was barred from future events after it emerged the performer had been convicted of sexually assaulting a child aged under 14 in 2008, according to Newsweek.

The case has been cited by U.S. protesters, who say it illustrates the risks posed to children by drag performers.

Republican state representatives in Texas, Florida and Missouri have pledged to ban drag storytimes, citing safeguarding concerns.

A failed 2020 law in Missouri planned to block anything deemed to be “age-inappropriate sexual material” in a library, with fines and jail time for those who refused to comply.

In June, Florida representative Anthony Sabatini said he would propose legislation to terminate the parental rights of adults who take their children to drag events.

What do supporters of drag storytime events say?

Supporters say the shows are age-appropriate and that critics are motivated by homophobia, drawing on long-standing prejudices that equate being gay with pedophilia.

“Drag Queen Story Hour UK wants to show the world that being different is not a bad thing,” a spokesperson for the group said. “By providing imaginative role models for children to look up to, we can change the world book by book.”

All their performers go through criminal records checks and receive training on working with children, the group said.

Some events in Britain and the United States have been defended from opposition by counter protesters.

“I feel it’s important for my little girl to meet lots of different people in life and have a really good understanding of diversity,” said Rebecca Rickman-Jenkins, 42, who took her 5-year-old daughter to a drag story event in the city of Norwich.

“There is no adult content in any performance … Children love them because they are enthusiastic.”

What is the upshot?

Drag story hour organisers and performers have said they will not be deterred by the criticism.

“It does upset me to see that these people still exist … but what I would say is that these people are also the drive behind what I do,” Sab Samuel, who founded Drag Queen Story Hour UK and performs as Aida H Dee, told the BBC in August.

Protesters also said they would not be backing down.

“Our group wouldn’t be here if there weren’t all these issues,” said INN co-founder Joe Strutt.

“We want our kids to be left alone to exist.”

With drag storytime events seeing swift growth in recent years, the row is not likely to die down soon.

“The protests (are) just so sad,” said story hour founder Tea.

“I feel very bad for anyone whose hearts and minds are so cranky, paranoid and impoverished that they would feel motivated to try to crush something so joyful.

“But they’re giving all of us parents a lot of teaching moments, which is valuable.”

“This decision marks the first time since 1869 that a court has disqualified a public official under Section 3, and the first time that any court has ruled the events of January 6, 2021 an insurrection,” noted Citizens for Ethics while reporting on the ruling.

In March, Griffin was convicted on a federal misdemeanor for entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021, and sentenced to 14 days in jail, but released for time served.

District Court Judge Francis Mathew ruled that Griffin be immediately removed from office and permanently banned from any future office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment – also known as the “Disqualification Clause.”

Citizens for Ethics breaks down the language of the clause:

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, bars any person from holding federal or state office who took an “oath…to support the Constitution of the United States” as an “officer of any State” and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or gave “aid or comfort” to insurrectionists. Griffin, as an Otero County Commissioner since January 2019, took an oath to “support and uphold the Constitution and laws of the State of New Mexico, and the Constitution of the United States.”

Efforts to bar Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) from running for reelection based on the same clause failed in May. Judges struck down similar efforts, backed by voting rights nonprofit Free Speech for People, which also sought to bar Reps.

https://themilitant.com/2022/08/13/back-warrior-met-strikers-demand-13-3-million-fine-be-thrown-out/,Back Warrior Met strikers! Demand $13.3 million fine be thrown out! – The Militant,"BROOKWOOD, Ala. — In a calculated attack on workers’ right to strike, the National Labor Relations Board Region 10 on Aug. 2 ordered the United Mine Workers of America to pay $13.3 million to Brookwood-based Warrior Met Coal, where hundreds of UMWA miners have been waging a hard-fought strike battle for more than 16 months.

“This is a slap in the face not just to the workers who are fighting for better jobs at Warrior Met Coal, but to every worker who stands up to their boss anywhere in America,” said UMWA President Cecil Roberts the next day.

“What is the purpose of a strike if not to impact the operations of the employer, including production?” asked Roberts. “Is it now the policy of the federal government that unions be required to pay a company’s losses as a consequence of their members exercising their rights as working people? This is outrageous and effectively negates workers’ right to strike. It cannot stand.”

The supposedly nonpartisan NLRB ruled that Warrior Met Coal was due payment for a wide variety of costs the board claimed the union was responsible for — including hiring increased security, for buses to ferry scabs across the picket line, damage repair, as well as lost revenues from unmined coal. It also said individual scabs and management personnel were due $30,000, mostly for damages to their vehicles while crossing the picket line.

“The company is spending millions to try to defeat us,” striker Antwon McGee, who was a longwall helper before the strike started, told the Militant after learning about the ruling. “But it won’t work. I’m going to be on that picket line until the end!”

McGee, who has worked at the mine for 17 years, spoke about union members’ determination to continue the fight.

“With all the money the company has spent to defeat us, they could have given us a decent contract,” said McGee.

“The company thinks if they can defeat the UMWA, they’ve taken a step against other unions too,” he said. “It will make it harder for smaller unions at other companies to win their fights. That’s why solidarity is so very important!

“We’re fighting for our worth as workers, for our dignity,” he said. “This strike is a real struggle.”

The latest NLRB decision came as a result of a settlement the union and company entered into in June, in response to charges made by Warrior Met about union activity on the picket line. In order to save members and families from “days of hostile questioning by company lawyers,” the union signed the agreement, according to the union. But on July 22, the NLRB sent the union the $13.3 million bill for a detailed list of damages, more than 33 times the estimated amount NLRB lawyers had initially indicated.

“What’s extremely troubling here is that the NLRB appears to have taken up the company’s cause without a second thought,” Roberts added. “Warrior Met Coal instigated this strike and has brutally extended it through its sustained unwillingness to reach a fair and reasonable agreement,” he said. “We have no intention of paying its costs for doing so. The right to strike in America must be preserved.”

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters issued a statement of solidarity with the UMWA Aug. 5, rejecting the NLRB’s ruling.

16-month-long bitter strike

The strike began April 1, 2021, when some 1,100 union members walked out at Warrior Met’s operations in Tuscaloosa County, which include the No. 4 and No. 7 mines, a preparation plant and central shop. Picket lines were also set up at several railroad crossings. About 900 workers remain on strike, the union reports.

According to The Associated Press, the company reported net income of $146.2 million in the first quarter of 2022, producing metallurgical coal for steel manufacturers in Europe, South American and Africa.

In 2015 the mines’ previous owner, Jim Walter Resources, filed for bankruptcy. The company’s biggest creditors, hedge funds like BlackRock from New York, organized Warrior Met Coal and told miners they would only keep the mines running if they got major concessions from the union, which they promised to make up later when they began making a profit.

Along with being forced to take a $6-an-hour pay cut, miners’ health care costs were increased from a $12 co-pay to a $1,500 deductible. The union had to negotiate a $25 million Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association plan to continue retirees’ health care. Extra overtime pay for Sundays and holidays was eliminated; 13 annual paid holidays were cut to three; a draconian attendance policy was instituted, along with no cap on forced overtime. The union estimates the losses to workers totaled $1.1 billion over the five years of the contract. The union members say, “No more!”

As the strike has gone on, many union members have gotten other jobs, while maintaining their picket duty. Miners report several dozen have gotten jobs at other union mines in the area.

In October 2021, the company won a court order from a Tuscaloosa County Circuit Court judge to force a stop to all picketing or other union activity within 300 yards of Warrior Met Coal. The order was extended several times. Picketing was finally allowed to resume in February 2022, but with some restrictions.

In May the union reported the company had insisted a settlement won’t be reached unless the UMWA agrees that 37 union members be fired for picket line activity, which the union refuses to do.

The company has been producing coal at both struck mines, using management personnel and scabs, including some union members who have crossed the picket line.

Recently union members have been picketing only at shift change times twice a day. Now the union is stepping up its presence at mine entrances, while complying with the court’s current restrictions.

While the company has been violence-baiting union members for picket line activity, local, county and state police continue to act as escorts for the scabs and refuse to take any action against Warrior Met management personnel and other scabs who on several occasions have purposely struck miners or family members peacefully picketing at the No. 7 mine entrance. Last August, the NLRB dismissed out of hand union charges about these assaults.

The union has been organizing regular solidarity rallies since shortly after the strike began. These often draw unionists from Alabama and beyond, in addition to UMWA strikers, family members and retirees. Now scheduled for every other week due to heat considerations, the next rally will be Aug. 17 at 6 p.m. at UMWA Local 2397’s union hall here.

Meanwhile, UMWA locals and districts in other parts of the country, as well as many other international unions, locals, and individual workers continue to contribute to the strike fund, which pays weekly benefits to strikers. A well-organized auxiliary organized by strikers’ spouses helps gather and distribute food and other donations.

He was an infant when his father, Lt. Craig Cobb, joined the Alliance Fire Department. Now 23, he has been with the department for four years.

""I been around this my whole life,"" Hunter Cobb said.

Cobb was in charge of this year's Pump-In and Muster event on Sunday at Glamorgan Castle, part of the 2022 Greater Alliance Carnation Festival. ""This is my first year running it.""

Thousands of families and individuals came out for the day-long program which included contests, demonstrations and plenty of activities for children.

""It's a great opportunity for the community to come out and see what we do, from all around,"" Cobb said.

Regrowing participation

Participating in this year's Pump-In were fire departments from Alliance, Sebring, Washington Township, Lexington Township, Marlboro Township and Damascus.

""In the past years, the participation has come down, and I've been really trying hard to get participation back up. COVID had a lot to do with it, I think,"" Cobb said.

He continued: ""This year, we already have more departments here than we did last year.""

Stark Fire Department Rehab Unit from Maximo also was present, as were vendors and event sponsor Pauli Electric, Inc. A helicopter from State MedEvac also landed for a short time for people to see.

At 1 p.m., the Pump-In event took a break for the Kick Off Parade that went Union Avenue to Glamorgan Street and ended at the castle.

""They were nice enough to fly out and let everyone see their side of the job is for us,"" Cobb said.

Will Kinser, a firefighter for Washington Township, was helping children use a fire hose to spray down a ""burning"" house, one of the many kid-friendly activities.

""The community outreach we can provide, to build that bond with each other, is great,"" Kinser said. ""Some kids might think firefighters are scary in all their gear.

""But, at the end of the day, we're all the same people. And we're just here to have a good time and build relationships with everyone.""

So many fire trucks

No less than 15 fire trucks, with sirens blaring, took part in the parade sponsored by The Alliance Review.

The procession also included marching bands and cheerleading squads from Alliance High School and Marlington High School, a color guard and a group of custom Jeeps.

Also, a mobile memorial to those lost in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was part of the parade, brought to the area from Malvern.

Amy Carver of Alliance with her grandchildren came for the Pump-In and the parade. ""They loved it,"" she said.

https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2022/sep/06/federal-gun-prosecutions-in-little-rock-designed/,Federal gun prosecutions in Little Rock designed to take most violent offenders off the street,"The Little Rock area has long had a reputation for violent crime, dating back to the mid-90s following release of an HBO documentary, ""Gang War: Bangin' in Little Rock,"" that spotlighted drug-and-gang-fueled violence that plagued the city due to tensions between rival street gangs battling one another over reprisals and territorial disputes.

That documentary cast an unwelcome spotlight on the capital city -- which in 1992 had a record 71 homicides, according to Little Rock Police Department statistics -- that civic leaders have been battling to overcome ever since. But the documentary did result in a large increase in personnel for the Little Rock Police Department that made significant inroads in eradicating the gang problem for a time after prosecutions sent many of the participants to prison.

Although the gang violence ebbed for a time, Little Rock has once again found itself cast in an unfavorable light following an uptick in violent crime, punctuated by 17 shootings in the Little Rock area over the Aug. 12-14 weekend that left three people dead and three more injured.

In 2020, the latest year for which FBI statistics are available, Little Rock had 55 homicides. Although other comparably sized cities in the region experienced more homicides that year -- 110 in Jackson, Miss., 102 in Baton Rouge, and 69 in Shreveport -- Little Rock eclipsed each of the three cities in overall violent crime reports that year with 3,657 reports, compared to 1,614 in Jackson, 2,087 in Baton Rouge, and 1,713 in Shreveport, according to FBI statistics.

Michael Gibbons, a homicide detective with the North Little Rock Police Department who also serves as a task force officer with the local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) field office, said even though the numbers of violent crimes in Central Arkansas remain stubbornly high, the emphasis on taking violent armed offenders off the streets does provide some relief to many neighborhoods. One impediment to those efforts, he said, is the changing nature of the violence.

Instead of joining larger, more organized street gangs such as those affiliated with the Crips or the Bloods, Gibbons said, many of the most troublesome offenders are younger and more likely to belong to small gangs organized around rap music.

""Rap music has glorified gun possession and gun use,"" he said. ""It's in every song now. That's where gangs have gone, they've gone from Bloods and Crips to neighborhoods, then to blocks, and now it's rap group gangs ... There's no godfather anymore. It's down to rap groups.""

When members of rival groups encounter one another,"" Gibbons said, shootouts are often the result regardless of the location or who might be caught in the crossfire.

Even so, Gibbons said, vigorous prosecution efforts do take some of the worst offenders off the street, which he said provides relief for a time.

""It's amazing how the shootings drop in certain neighborhoods when we take certain people off the streets,"" Gibbons said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gordon, the criminal chief for the office of the U.S. Attorney in Little Rock, is responsible for evaluating and assigning cases. He said all gun cases referred to the office have to be evaluated to determine if federal prosecution is warranted, with the level of violence factoring heavily in the equation.

""If it is, we find a place to put it ... We don't take every case that's referred to us. We can't,"" he said. ""But shooters get top priority every single time.""

FOCUS ON VIOLENT CRIME

Lauren Eldridge, a special assistant U.S. attorney hired last year through a federal Project Safe Neighborhoods grant to prosecute violent crimes, said special attention is paid to the more violent offenders, those who have used or who are suspected of using firearms in the past.

""One thing we focus on is history,"" Eldridge said. ""We will prioritize those with a long history of violent conduct.""

Clayton Merrill, resident agent in charge of the local ATF field office in Little Rock, said enforcement efforts there are focused on identifying and arresting violent offenders, with a particular emphasis on those involved in shootings.

""A lot of people carry guns. A lot of bad people carry guns,"" Merrill said. ""But only a few pull the trigger, and that's who we go after.""

The U.S. attorney's office focus on gun crime ramped up in 2018 under former U.S. Attorney Cody Hiland to combat the resurgence of violent crime in Central Arkansas.

At that time, federal penalties were more severe than the state could bring to bear, in large part because of the federal requirement that inmates serve a minimum of 85% of their sentence before being considered for ""good time"" early release for good behavior. That policy typically resulted in longer prison sentences at the federal level, where penalties for gun possession cases range from 10 years to life in prison, depending upon the underlying relevant conduct of each defendant. For years, by contrast, many state convictions resulted in offenders' spending only a fraction of their sentences in custody before being paroled.

Last year the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 946 of 2021 -- which prohibits parole for offenders with previous violent crime convictions -- to address those disparities.

U.S. Attorney Jonathan Ross said his office has recently seen a drop in cases referred by local authorities -- an indication, he said, that the new law is working.

""Our state and local partners are referring less cases to us because they have that tool available to them,"" Ross said. ""We've been helping the state while it's been basically walking around with one arm tied behind its back, and now they've got greater resources to deploy.""

Larry Jegley, the 6th Judicial District prosecuting attorney for Pulaski and Perry counties, said since the law was implemented it has resulted in more prosecutions at the state level. He said the decision to prosecute or refer such cases still depends, however, on the individual circumstances underlying each case.

""We still try to look at gun cases and see where we can get the most bang for the buck, so to speak, in either state or federal court,"" Jegley said. ""The law gives us the ability to do what we previously couldn't do, which is to get more prison time than the feds could do.""

CONCERNS OVER EFFECTIVENESS

But while prosecutors may see benefits to the policy of prioritizing gun possession cases, some defense attorneys voiced concerns about the volume of cases.

Michael Kaiser, a local defense attorney who practices in both state and federal courts, said he's concerned about how the federal prosecutions are applied as priorities shift, as well as the overall effectiveness of the prosecutions.

""If the police want to make more gun cases, there'll be more gun cases, and if they want to make less gun cases, there'll be less,"" Kaiser said. ""I don't think either of that affects majorly the number of guns on the street or the number of guns available to those who shouldn't have them.""

He characterized the prosecutions as a way to ""mop things up on the back end to make it appear that we're preventing things,"" and said focusing exclusively on violent offenders would be the most effective way to conduct the prosecutions.

""That would seem to be the best way to use federal power,"" Kaiser said, ""if you're actually trying to stop violent crime, but just a guy having a gun on a traffic stop, that's the majority of my federal gun cases.""

Defense attorney Blake Hendrix of Little Rock said he also has concerns about the numbers of prosecutions but acknowledged the problem of violence has been pervasive for years.

""In my career I've seen it ebb and flow, like the crack days,"" he said. ""In the '90s we were overloaded with crack and gun cases. Then there's meth, then heroin's coming back and now it's guns, guns, guns.""

Hendrix said not all of the defendants chosen for federal prosecution are violent. To illustrate, Hendrix related the case of one client he said is being federally prosecuted due to prior convictions for theft of scrap metal, criminal mischief, theft of property, and possession of firearms by certain persons and is facing a possible 10-year sentence.

""There's no violence in this guy's past,"" Hendrix said. ""I'm not really sure why ... if the emphasis is on violent people, because this kid's not. He may have just gotten sucked up in a big vacuum or maybe their policy is broader than we think it is.""

Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison Bragg said that although the emphasis currently is on violent felons, the office did initially seek indictments for a wider range of gun cases that didn't involve past violent acts and, at its discretion, can do so again.

""If you look really hard y0u'll find some like that in the past,"" Bragg said. ""I've prosecuted that kind of case before, but right now, especially with the rash of violence and higher-priority defendants, I don't want to create the perception of, oh we would never if he had a forgery from 20 years ago. I've prosecuted a guy who had a 20-year-old forgery conviction and a gun in the console, probably in 2018 because we were prosecuting every single gun case that we could.

""There was a time ... where if it was a gun and we could charge it, we did.""

At least three more persons were killed in flash flood and monsoon rains in Balochistan on Thursday.

26 August,2022 05:27 am

QUETTA (Dunya News) - At least three more persons were killed in flash floods and monsoon rains in Balochistan, raising the death toll to 237 on Thursday, Dunya News reported.

As per Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) report, death toll from recent monsoon rains and floods in different parts of Balochistan has risen to 237 while 102 persons have been injured.

The report informed that the deaths in flood and rain-related incidents were reported from Quetta, Bolan, Kech, Zhob, Duki, Khuzdar, Kohlu, Mastung, Harnai, Qila Saifullah, Sibi and other districts.

The PDMA reported that the heavy rains caused loss of 107,377 livestock. The PDMA reported that 29,818 houses were damaged by the rains and floods in the province out of which 8,423 houses were completely destroyed while 21,325 houses were partially damaged.

The PDMA reported that six different highways with 710 km length and 18 bridges were damaged due to the floods. The PDMA is conducting relief operations in the affected districts.

According to PDMA, at least 300 tents, 100 food packets, 100 blankets, 200 mats and 500 mosquito nets were distributed to the victims in the affected districts of Mastung and Sibi during the last 24 hours.

Floods leave 30 million homeless, thousands left without food

Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Thursday referring to the havoc wreaked by the ongoing unprecedented monsoon rains, said Pakistan was going through a climate-induced humanitarian disaster at the moment.

The media should play an effective role in highlighting the plight of flood victims, rescue and relief efforts, and damages to life and property so that the stakeholders could manage a well-coordinated response with public support, she told a press conference.

Sherry said the country had so far received an average of 166 millimetres of rainfall during the month of August, which was 241% above normal, whereas its southern parts, particularly Sindh, got 784% more than normal average rain for the season, which was alarming.

The Met Office statistics were startling, she said, adding the flash floods caused by massive rains had swept away bridges and communication infrastructure in various areas of the provinces.

The current deluge in the Indus River was even worse than the super flood of 2010, Sherry remarked. The minister said a national emergency had been declared in the country as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal had postponed their official visits abroad. ""We are in the eighth spell of monsoon rains with southern Pakistan receiving heavy rains, including 23 districts of Sindh declared as calamity-hit.""

She said as half of the country in the south was inundated, the armed forces and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), along with provincial governments, were actively engaged in rescue and relief activities.

""Almost 30 million people are without shelter, thousands of them displaced and have no food. As needs assessment is underway and will be completed soon, which will help in approaching donor agencies for relief and rescue as the crisis has surpassed the capacity of the government. ""

She reiterated that it was not possible for a government or a province to solely handle such massive flooding and heavy rains. ""The Prime Minister’s Relief Fund account is active to accept donations for the disaster-hit masses, whereas tents have been ordered by the NDMA and PDMAs (Provincial Disaster Management Authorities). The prime minister has also opened a war room at the NDMA to spearhead and monitor rescue and relief efforts. ""

The minister underlined that there was a forecast of extended monsoon activity in September, which was again an alarming one.

She said the Sukkur and Taunsa barrages had high water flow and all available machinery and other resources were being utilised in the affected region. At present, all the departments were focused on flood-hit areas to cope with any evolving situation.

Sherry said some 913 people had perished in rain-related incidents, with a higher number of deaths among children in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, the number of the injured was also reported to be high, she added.

She said it was now time for donors and the world to support Pakistan, which had always volunteered to assist nations, including its neighbours during natural disasters.

South Dakota News Watch

A majority of South Dakotans believe the state’s abortion ban is too restrictive and that voters should determine the legality of abortion access rather than the state Legislature, according to a statewide poll sponsored by South Dakota News Watch.

The poll of 500 registered voters showed that a majority (57%) of respondents support allowing legal access to abortion medications in the state, including 42% who “strongly support” such access. Nearly two-thirds (65%) said they support having a statewide referendum to determine South Dakota’s laws regarding reproductive rights.

More than three-fourths (76%) of those polled support allowing legal abortion in cases of rape and incest, an exception not currently allowed under South Dakota’s laws, among the most restrictive in the nation following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade in June.

The random survey was conducted July 19-22, 2022, by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy and contacted voters in all South Dakota counties by landline and cell phone; it was co-sponsored by News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5%.

The recent landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs vs. Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization removed the federal constitutional right to an abortion, leaving it up to states to determine legality and access. South Dakota had a “trigger law” from 2005 that took effect, making it a Class 6 felony for anyone ""who administers to any pregnant female or prescribes or procures for any pregnant female"" a means for an abortion, except to save the life of the mother. The crime is punishable by two years in prison, a $4,000 fine, or both.

“That’s the reality we’re living in right now,” said Rick Weiland, whose Dakotans for Health organization plans to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2024 to legalize but regulate access to abortion in South Dakota. “I do think recent events have galvanized a segment of people who haven’t engaged in the past because now they see their rights being taken away.”

The poll also showed that nearly 8 in 10 respondents (79%) oppose criminal penalties for anyone who helps a South Dakota resident obtain an abortion where it is legal, such as in a neighboring state. An overwhelming majority (71%) also support permitting South Dakota residents to leave the state to obtain abortions.

Dale Bartscher, executive director of South Dakota Right to Life, declined an interview request from News Watch but was quoted by the Washington Post recently as saying he was “very interested” in preventing South Dakota residents from accessing abortion in other states.

“I’ve heard that bantered about across the state of South Dakota,” Bartscher told the Post.

Gov. Kristi Noem had no comment on the poll results when contacted through her office by News Watch.

The poll revealed no significant differences in responses based on age, gender or region of the state. Though there were partisan differences, a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents support holding a statewide abortion referendum; support legalized abortion in the cases of rape and incest; and support allowing residents to leave the state to legally seek abortions in other states.

The majority of respondents in all parties also oppose criminal penalties for those who help individuals obtain an abortion in a state where it is legal.

Julia Hellwege, an associate professor of political science at the University of South Dakota, said that bipartisan agreement is likely attributable to shared distaste for too much government intervention rather than any sort of moral agreement on abortion.

“It’s important to note that (the poll) is differentiating the action of having an abortion versus criminalizing the action and role that the state should play,” said Hellwege. “If the question was simply ‘do you support abortion?’ or ‘would you have one yourself?’’ there would likely be different results. These questions were about the state’s role, and a lot of South Dakotans, as it shows, don’t support the state intervening.”

Weiland, a former Democratic candidate for U.S. House and Senate, said the responses show that abortion restrictions supported by Noem and the Republican-controlled Legislature are not representative of the general electorate.

“There’s been tremendous overreach,” said Weiland. “But the court threw it back to the states, and it’s reassuring that people in South Dakota want it decided by a ballot initiative and not by the governor or state Legislature.”

The constitutional amendment proposed by Dakotans for Health would prevent the state from regulating abortions during the first trimester. During the second trimester, the state could regulate “the abortion decision and its effectuation only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.” After the end of the second trimester, abortion could be regulated or prohibited except to preserve “the life or health” of the mother.

Dakotans for Health, which can legally start collecting petition signatures on Nov. 5, plans to use both volunteers and paid circulators to get the measure on the ballot for 2024.

It wouldn’t be the first time South Dakotans have gone to the ballot box to determine state abortion laws. In 2006, the Legislature passed a law to ban all abortions except to save the life of a pregnant woman. The measure was signed by then-Gov. Mike Rounds, but opponents gathered enough signatures to refer it to the ballot, where it was defeated with more than 55% percent of the vote.

Two years later, voters rejected by a margin of 55% to 45% a ballot initiative that would have banned all abortions in the state except in cases of rape or incest or “to preserve the health or life of the woman.”

In Kansas, a state that former President Donald Trump won with 56% of the vote in 2020, voters on Aug. 2 overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the Republican-controlled legislature to tighten restrictions or ban abortion outright, with 59% voting against the amendment. Turnout was unusually high for a primary election, with nearly half of registered voters casting a ballot.

That came on the heels of a national Pew Research Center poll after the Dobbs decision that showed 62% of respondents saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

https://www.breitbart.com:443/national-security/2022/08/19/taliban-supreme-leader-says-foreign-affairs-will-follow-islamic-law/,Taliban Supreme Leader Says Foreign Affairs Will Follow Islamic Law,"Taliban Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada held a meeting of some 3,000 tribal and regional officials in Kandahar on Thursday, during which he said foreign affairs would be conducted in accordance with the Taliban’s notion of Islamic sharia law. In other words, he was pledging to ignore international human rights concerns, including objections to the Taliban’s barbaric treatment of women.

Akhundzada is the reclusive “spiritual leader” of the Taliban and the nominal head of state for the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.” He communicates largely through audio and written statements, frequently invoking his authority as a cleric to make pronouncements on Muslim religious matters.

Little is known about Akhundzada except that he was an early recruit to the Taliban, he served as its chief judge during the 1996-2001 regime, he fled to Pakistan to run a religious academy after the U.S. invasion, and his son Abdur Rahman was a suicide bomber. He keeps such a low profile that rumors of his death constantly swirl through Afghanistan. Kandahar is thought to be his base of operations.

Analysts disagree about how much power Akhundzada actually wields. Some credit him with pulling the various factions of the Taliban together for the conquest of Afghanistan after President Joe Biden’s disastrous withdrawal of American forces in 2021. Others see him as a figurehead, occasionally trotted out to make religious pronouncements or oversee ceremonial events.

Ayman al-Zawahiri, the al-Qaeda leader harbored by the Taliban who was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Kabul at the beginning of August, swore allegiance to Akhundzada shortly after the fall of Kabul. One of the “supreme leader’s” major functions appears to be collecting such vows of fealty.

Akhundzada occasionally takes the lead in pushing back against the human rights concerns of the civilized world. In July, he addressed an assembly of Muslim clerics in Kabul and declared foreigners “should not give us their orders” because Afghanistan has become an “independent country” under Taliban rule.

“The success of the Afghan jihad is not only a source of pride for Afghans but also for Muslims all over the world,” he declared.

The gathering Akhundzada addressed in Kandahar on Thursday was roughly as large as the July confab in Kabul. The Taliban took the occasion to condemn the U.S. drone strike that killed Zawahiri and threaten neighboring countries that allowed their airspace to be used for such operations.

“This meeting is called to think about the freedom we received by the blessing of Allah, which we achieved from the blood of our mujahideen,” he told the gathering.

“We will deal with the international community as per Islamic Sharia,” Akhundzada said. “If Sharia doesn’t allow it, we will not deal with any other country.”

Akhundzada and other Taliban officials insist the “Islamic Emirate” has full control over all of Afghanistan, but a deadly bombing in Kabul that killed influential cleric Amir Mohammad Kabuli on Wednesday was the latest evidence that the Islamic State (ISIS) is still contesting Taliban rule. A week earlier, ISIS took responsibility for a bomb attack that killed another prominent cleric linked to the Taliban.

The Taliban also faces a surprisingly successful insurgency in northern Afghanistan, led by one of its own former commanders, Mawlawi Mahdi Mujahid.

Mahdi is a Shiite Muslim, unlike the majority of Taliban leaders who are Sunnis, and he appears to be gathering strength among Shiites and other alienated Afghan minorities, such as the Hazaras. His group is too small to fight for control of the entire country, but he controls enough territory to prompt a brutal counter-offensive from the Taliban.",Q3
https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2022-07-08/wisconsin-supreme-court-disallows-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes,Wisconsin Supreme Court disallows absentee ballot drop boxes,"MADISON, Wis. — Wisconsin’s conservative-controlled Supreme Court ruled Friday that absentee ballot drop boxes may be placed only in election offices and that no one other than the voter can return a ballot in person, dealing a defeat to Democrats who said the decision would make it harder to vote in the battleground state.

However, the court didn’t address whether anyone other than the voter can return his or her own ballot by mail. That means that anyone could still collect multiple ballots for voters and, instead of using a drop box, put them in the mail.

Republicans have argued that practice, known as ballot harvesting, is rife with fraud although there has been no evidence of that happening in Wisconsin. Democrats and others argue that many voters, particularly the elderly and disabled, have difficulty returning their ballots without the assistance of others.

Supporters argue drop boxes are a better option than mailing ballots because they go directly to the clerks and can’t be lost or delayed in transit.

Twenty-nine other states allow for absentee ballot drop boxes, according to the U.S. Vote Foundation.

The decision sets absentee ballot rules for the Aug. 9 primary and the fall election; Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers are seeking reelection in key races.

Johnson and other Republicans hailed it as a win for voter integrity.

“This decision is a big step in the right direction,” Johnson said.

Evers and other Democrats said the ruling will make it more difficult for people to vote.

“It’s a slap in the face of democracy itself,” said Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler.

Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson, a Democrat, said ballot drop boxes are “monitored, secure, and provide citizens a way to cast their ballot safely.” He vowed to work within the confines of the law to provide as much access to the polls as possible in Milwaukee County, home to the state’s largest population of Democrats.

It’s good that the court still allows returning a ballot by mail, but voters should have as many options as possible, including drop boxes, said Shauntay Nelson, state director of the advocacy group All Voting is Local.

The court’s 4-3 ruling has critical implications in the 2024 presidential race, in which Wisconsin will again be among a handful of battleground states. President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes, four years after Trump narrowly won the state by a similar margin.

The popularity of absentee voting exploded during the pandemic in 2020, with more than 40% of all voters casting mail ballots, a record high. At least 500 drop boxes were set up in more than 430 communities for the election that year, including more than a dozen each in Madison and Milwaukee — the state’s two most heavily Democratic cities.

After Trump lost the state, he and Republicans alleged that drop boxes facilitated cheating, even though they offered no evidence. Democrats, election officials and some Republicans argued the boxes are secure.

The conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty sued in 2021. State law is silent on drop boxes. The court said the absence of a prohibition in state law does not mean that drop boxes are legal.

“Nothing in the statutory language detailing the procedures by which absentee ballots may be cast mentions drop boxes or anything like them,” Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote for the majority.

The court said absentee ballots can be returned only to the clerk’s office or a designated alternative site but that site cannot be an unstaffed drop box. The bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission had told local election officials the boxes can be placed at multiple locations and that ballots can be returned by people other than the voter, but put that on hold pending the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Rick Esenberg, president of the conservative law firm that brought the case, said the ruling “provides substantial clarity on the legal status of absentee ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting.” He said it also makes clear that state law, not guidance from the Elections Commission, is the final word on how elections are run.

Concerns about the safety of drop boxes expressed by the majority “is downright dangerous to our democracy” Justice Ann Walsh Bradley wrote in the dissent.

“But concerns about drop boxes alone don’t fuel the fires questioning election integrity,” she wrote. “Rather, the kindling is primarily provided by voter suppression efforts and the constant drumbeat of unsubstantiated rhetoric in opinions like this one, not actual voter fraud.”

Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature have also tried to enact laws limiting the use of absentee ballots, but Evers has vetoed them.

Republicans have made similar moves since Trump’s defeat to tighten access to ballots in other battleground states.

Bradley was joined in the majority by fellow conservative Justices Patience Roggensack, Brian Hagedorn and Chief Justice Annette Ziegler. In addition to Ann Walsh Bradley, fellow liberal Justices Rebecca Dallet and Jill Karofsky dissented.",Q3

Lawmakers had agreed on the parameters of a new bill on Thursday afternoon but were still nailing down details.

Governor Hochul, speaking a day before the session, said the legislation would make most public spaces off-limits for concealed weapons, including government offices, schools, hospitals, parks, playgrounds and all public gatherings with over 100 people.

“This is not the Wild West,” Hochul said on June 29. “This is New York state.”

Hochul said one of her jobs when she was Erie County clerk was to issue pistol permits and conduct background checks. She said there is a distinction between private gun ownership and the ability to conceal that weapon and take it anywhere.

“It is one thing to have a gun for your family’s protection in your home,” Hochul said. “But all of a sudden, now you’re out in the streets. Now you’re going to bars, now you’re going to the workplace. That is a whole different ball game.”

Private land and businesses would also fall under the new regulations. The default position would be that concealed weapons are not permitted, but a business or property owner would be free to post a sign saying guns are welcome.

The measures would also add to the requirements to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon. A more thorough background check would be conducted, and background checks would also be required for purchasing ammunition. There would be a mandatory 15 hours of in-person firearm safety training, and rules on safe storage would be expanded to include homes with anyone under the age of 18.

Hochul said the legislation would also allow localities, like densely populated cities, to impose more restrictions.

“I will not tie the hands of New York City,” Hochul said.

Hochul said the Supreme Court ruling means that the state cannot limit the carrying of concealed weapons everywhere. She said there will be more guns on the street now.",Q3

The billboards, which read ""Speech about abortion is free speech,"" challenge a section in Sen. Richard Cash's bill that would make it a felony to help a pregnant woman get an abortion, to include providing information by phone, email ""or any other mode of communication."" Under his bill, which even his GOP colleagues oppose as extreme, that phone conversation could send someone to prison for up to 25 years.

The Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression is spending more than $100,000 on 20 billboards in South Carolina as a first step to squash the idea nationwide. Drivers in Charleston, Greenville, Columbia and Myrtle Beach will see the billboards for four weeks, starting Aug. 15, FIRE spokespeople told The Post and Courier.

The timing coincides with a special session the Legislature's GOP majority created solely to consider an abortion ban.

Cash's bill has received a lot of attention since he introduced it June 28, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent on abortion rights and left the legality for state lawmakers to decide.

But it's not expected to get any traction.

""There's no support for doing something like that,"" said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield. ""I haven't heard anybody express support for that. But I've heard a lot of people say, 'This is terrible.' Even people who are supportive of Cash's position on life are not supportive"" of his bill.

Still, the free speech nonprofit hopes to stop the proposal from spreading to other states, regardless of its chances here. Billboard campaigns in other states could follow.

""These proposals are a chilling attempt to stifle free speech,"" said Will Creeley, FIRE's legal director. ""Whether you agree with abortion or not is irrelevant. You have the right to talk about it.""",Q3
https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-north-carolina-government-and-politics-eed39cf0a34e05a6559cb8f59237f2bc,NC AG’s staff asks judge not to restore 20-week abortion ban,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The North Carolina attorney general’s office, representing defendants in a 2019 case that blocked a state law banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, has joined plaintiffs in asking a federal court not to restore the ban after the judge suggested his injunction “may now be contrary to law.”

Reinstating restrictions in the aftermath of the June U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade would create “significant risk of public confusion” about the availability and legality of abortion services in North Carolina, the attorney general’s office argued in a brief filed late Monday in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.

Attorney General Josh Stein, an outspoken proponent of abortion access, told reporters last week that he was continuing to recuse himself from the case, despite Republican General Assembly leaders’ accusations that his politics were interfering with his duty to defend the law.

Staff attorneys in Stein’s office filed the brief without the attorney general’s involvement.

“As attorney general, I will do everything in my power to protect women’s right to reproductive care because it’s the right thing to do and because it’s necessary to create the kind of North Carolina we all want,” Stein said Wednesday.

A month after U.S. District Judge William Osteen asked all parties in the case to file briefs explaining whether they think his previous ruling retains legal force in the absence of federal abortion protections, both parties said they do not see a strong legal argument for lifting the injunction at this time.

The two district attorneys who are named parties in the case said they “have no intention to exercise that enforcement authority” over the 20-week ban. Stein’s office said none of the state’s other district attorneys have indicated they would enforce the ban, either.

Though both parties oppose further action in the case, Republican legislative leaders are urging Osteen to move forward. Attorneys for Senate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, who are not named parties in the case, argued in a July 27 friend of the court brief that they had “significant interest” to intervene because Stein was avoiding his responsibilities by not seeking enforcement of the blocked 1973 state law.

The doctors who brought the case to court argue that because the legislative leaders are not named parties in the case, they should have to take additional steps for the court to consider their involvement.

“We’re confident that Judge Osteen will see through the political posturing of the plaintiffs and the attorney general’s office and lift the injunction now that Roe and Casey have been overturned,” said Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch, referring to the two cases struck down by the Supreme Court on June 24.

The “No More Stolen Sisters” exhibit at the Rahr-West Art Museum highlights the epidemic of violence against Indigenous women and girls. And the “Away From Home” exhibit a short walk away at the Manitowoc Public Library features the history of Indian boarding schools, which forcefully tried to assimilate Indigenous children.

“No More Stolen Sisters” features 49 works of art by 33 artists, including nationally renowned Oneida beadwork artist Karen Ann Hoffman from Stevens Point.

Her red flame urn, done in raised beadwork, is on display in the exhibit. Red has become the color emblematic of the awareness campaign for murdered and missing Indigenous women.

Artist Scott Hill’s painting in the exhibit features an Indigenous woman with a red handprint across her face, another symbol of the campaign.

Research from the National Center for Biotechnology Information shows Indigenous women in the U.S. are three times more likely to be murdered than white women.

“This is a really important issue that affects Wisconsin,” said Diana Bolander, assistant director at Rahr-West. “All of the feedback has been very positive. People have been blown away by the quality of the work.”

Because of the subject matter, a warning sign has been placed at the beginning of the exhibit, stating it may cause trauma to some viewers.

“It can be pretty heavy when they come in,” Bolander said. “People have had emotional reactions. Some were crying. It’s led to a lot of conversation about the role of art in society.”

Homicide is the third-leading cause of death for Indigenous girls and teens, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A formal count of the murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls in Wisconsin also is not currently available.

However, Indigenous researchers in Wisconsin have so far identified 22 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people dating back to 1980, with about half of them occurring in the last 10 years and with two of the victims being men.

Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul formed the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women Task Force in 2020 to investigate the issue, including its causes. The task force aims to have a report finalized by December, which is when Kaul’s term will expire.

An exhibit at Manitowoc Public Library, “Away From Home,” tells the story of another dark time affecting Indigenous communities, the infamous boarding schools.

Hundreds of Native American boarding schools existed in the U.S., part of a federal policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to assimilate Native youth into white society.

At least 11 of these boarding schools were in Wisconsin, including Tomah Indian Industrial School, a government-run, off-reservation school about 40 miles east of La Crosse.

Many of the schools were government-funded and based off the model at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, one of the largest boarding schools in the country. Its founder, Richard H. Pratt, famously espoused, “Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.”

One display at the library shows a barber’s chair with a piece of long, braided hair cut off on the chair and a story from a survivor about how disgraceful it was for an Indigenous person to have their hair cut off.

Another display shows handcuffs specially made for children.

“It’s a dark corner of American history,” said Tim Gadzinski, marketing associate for the library. “Unfortunately, a lot of people aren’t aware of it.”

He said a local Indigenous person recently visited the exhibit and left a small pouch of tobacco as an offering.

“The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive,” Gadzinski said. “People have been struck by everything in the exhibit. … It’s been well attended. I’m a little surprised there hasn’t been any negative feedback. There’s a certain segment of the population that doesn’t like to look at history for what it is.”

The closing reception for “No More Stolen Sisters” is from 1 to 4 p.m. July 31 at Rahr-West, 610 N. Eighth St., Manitowoc. Artists Karen Ann Hoffman and Valaria Tatera will provide remarks and light refreshments will be provided. The museum is open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays and 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays-Sundays.

“Away From Home” runs until Aug. 11 at the library, which is at 707 Quay St., Manitowoc. The library is open 9 a.m.-8 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays, 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Fridays, 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturdays and noon-4 p.m. Sundays.

El Paso County Sheriff’s Deputy Andrew Peery, 39, was wounded Sunday after he arrived with two other law enforcement officers to investigate a report of a shooting at the home in the community of Security-Widefield near Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs police said in a statement. John Paz, 33, fired at the officers, hitting Peery, and another sheriff’s deputy returned fire, police said.

Officers found the body of the woman in the home’s front yard, police said. Paz died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

Colorado Springs police, which is investigating the shooting, believe Paz also killed the woman. Her connection to Paz was still being investigated, spokesperson Jason Newton said.

Paz worked at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s airfield in the 94th Flying Training Squadron, which conducts glider training for cadets. He had been an aviation resource management technician there since December, school spokesperson Dean J. Miller said.

“Our condolences go out to all the friends and family affected by Sunday’s incident,” Miller said.

People lined up on Sunday to honor Peery as a hearse carrying his remains drove from a hospital to the coroner’s office.

Gov. Jared Polis also expressed sympathy to the family of Peery, who was a decorated member of the sheriff’s department’s SWAT team.

“My thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of Deputy Peery and all our neighbors in law enforcement who put their lives at risk to serve others,” he said.

Providence community protests plan to turn Superman Building into luxury apartments,"Around 90 people gathered in Burnside Park in Providence, Rhode Island, on Sept. 1 to protest a development plan for so-called “affordable” housing. The plan would give millions in government subsidies and tax breaks to a private real estate developer to convert the Industrial National Bank Building into luxury apartments.

Like the rest of the country, Rhode Island is in the midst of a statewide housing crisis where truly affordable housing is almost impossible to find and evictions and rent hikes run rampant. Protesters called on the government to fund public, affordable homes while protesting the gross misuse of a building which could house hundreds of families.

The rally was called by DARE — Direct Action For Rights And Equality. Terri Wright, an organizer with DARE’s Tenant and Homeowner Association, told the crowd that “A lot of this plan is about luring rich people in, and pushing poor people out of the city.” She added, “They take our money when we come down here and shop, they take our dollars — but we can’t afford to live down here.”

‘Affordable’ housing for whom?

The Industrial National Bank Building, colloquially known as the Superman Building, stands at the heart of downtown Providence and is the tallest building in Rhode Island. The 26-floor building was constructed in 1928 by the Industrial Trust Company, and was occupied by banks until 2013. It is currently owned by a Massachusetts-based real estate company, High Rock Development LLC.

Since 2013 the building has remained vacant, while the owner of High Rock has requested public funds to redevelop it. In April of this year, the Rhode Island state government announced a $220 million redevelopment plan to convert the Superman Building into 285 residential apartments. The redevelopment plan includes $41 million in state and city funding and tax credits, and a 30-year tax treaty — the terms of which have not yet been made public.

According to that proposal, 228 of those apartments will be market rate apartments, and only 57 units will be affordable housing. But calling these units “affordable” is a misnomer since they require 80 to 120% of the area’s median income for anyone to afford them. With more and more wealthy people moving into Providence, 80% AMI amounts to $54,150 for a household of one. Only fourteen units — including studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments — are marked for that price point. The rest are more expensive.

Voices from Rhode Island’s working class

Christian Torre of the Party for Socialism and Liberation spoke about the inhumanity and irrationality of a system where the building, which could have housed hundreds of people, was kept empty during a homelessness crisis because profit could not be made. “Before the pandemic started,” Torre said, “Rhode Island was already in a housing crisis with the highest eviction rate in New England. Since the pandemic, the crisis has only gotten worse.”

Torre branded the current plan as government-aided hoarding and price gouging: “They’re pricing us out of our city, and they’re spending our tax dollars to do it! We won’t let that happen. Poor and working people have a right to a home! It is our sweat, our labor and our work that run this city, not the politicians, not the developers, and certainly not High Rock!”

“If the state wants to ‘breathe life back into this city,’ those tax credits need to be put back into infrastructure and to house those that need it,” Kendra, a member of the THA, said. “We need housing not for the minority, but the majority of our community.”

In addition to opposing the redevelopment plan, organizers voiced general demands to ensure at least 33% of units in any new housing development be reserved for low-income housing and called for city-wide rent stabilization.

Olivia, an organizer with the Tenant Network, stressed the need to form tenant unions, saying that “market based approaches that prioritize profit over human lives have absolutely failed us.”

Barbara Fleury of the George Wiley Center told Liberation News that she came to the protest because the plan is “an incorrect allocation for luxury housing in the name of affordable housing.”

Anna, who heard about the event from a local reading group, attended the rally because “Housing is a right! It’s frustrating that using the name of affordable housing is being used for something else.”

Ryan, a member of a local socialist group, said, “capitalism does not consider housing as a human right.” Another protester, Kat, said, “big buildings are being turned into luxury housing. Who is this city actually working for?”

‘We need to out-organize them!‘

The rally was followed by a march which stopped first at Providence City Hall where protesters served an eviction notice to those responsible for the deal: the mayor, the planning director and executive director of the Providence Redevelopment Agency, and members of Rhode Island Housing. The crowd then marched to the Superman Building across the street, chanting, “Whose city? Our city! Whose building? Our building!”

With the slogan “Superman Won’t Save Us,” organizers spoke to the need for a movement to win real housing justice. “We need to learn how to help one another to stand up for one another,” said Brenda Taylor of the THA.

“We need to be organized,” Torre said. “The rich have the politicians, the real estate builders, the so-called foundations, the police. And they use them all in a highly organized manner to enrich and bail themselves out. But they don’t have the numbers. We, working people, have the numbers. And we need to out-organize them!”",Q3
https://sfist.com/2022/07/25/port-of-oakland-reopens-as-ab5-trucker-protest-moved-to-a-free-speech-zone/,Port of Oakland Reopens as AB5 Trucker Protest Moved to a ‘Free Speech Zone’,"A trucker blockade that held up operations at the Port of Oakland for a week is resolved for now, though could return, as port officials promise they will “liaison” with Governor Newsom over the impact of independent contractor law AB5 on the trucking industry.

You probably know the Port Oakland best for its large white cranes that are (incorrectly) rumored to be the inspiration for the AT-AT Walkers in The Empire Strikes Back. And you probably know the contentious California gig worker law called AB5 for the 2020 Uber and Lyft ballot measure Prop. 22 that successfully undid it, but only for “app-based drivers” at a specific handful of companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. AB5 remains in effect for independent contractors in pretty much all other industries.

These two very disparate concepts of AB5 and the Port of Oakland collided last week when a trucker protest shut down the Port of Oakland, because AB5 went into effect for the trucking industry on June 30 when the Supreme Court refused to hear their case against it. So masses of truckers blocked the ports of Oakland, Long Beach, and Los Angeles in protest. But the Oakland iteration of that protest is over, for now at least. The port and truckers have reached a temporary agreement, and KPIX reports the Port of Oakland has reopened and truckers will stop blocking the port.

“The Port of Oakland has resumed full operations,” Port executive director Danny Wan said in a release. ""We appreciate the independent truck drivers' use of the designated Free Speech Zones and we thank local law enforcement for their continued assistance.”

So what did the truckers get in return? Not a ton it seems, but since they were threatened with arrest, they are at least not in jail, nor are their trucks impounded. The Bay Area News Group report on the resolution of the trucker blockade notes that “the Port of Oakland promised to act as a liaison between the independent trucking community and Sacramento. The port will also establish a ‘working group’ of truckers and port officials to review ‘concerns regarding implementation of AB 5,’ according to a letter from port leadership released last week.”

“We are responsible citizens and it’s our responsibility to not break the supply chain,” freight company owner Navdeep Gill told the news group. He added they would “all come back” to blockade again without acceptable resolution from this so-called working group.

The industry publication Freight Waves has a statement from Gavin Newsom, which is a non-statement even by Newsom standards. “The state will continue to partner with truckers and the ports to ensure the continued movement of goods to California’s residents and businesses, which is critical to all of us,” the statement says. Newsom has previously carved out AB5 exemptions for a number of industries.

Notably, Newsom gave an exemption to freelance writers, photographers, and musicians, some say just so Willie Brown could keep writing his gossipy Chronicle column. Regardless, Brown’s column ended in January 2021.

https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2022/07/city-abc-changes-to-bar-membership-laws,"Bar memberships no longer required under new state law, will benefit local businesses","Top of the Hill Restaurant & Brewery owner and North Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association Board Member Scott Maitland said that the law dates back to prohibition in North Carolina.

“The irony to me is you'd have these people that, by definition, hate alcohol, don't want anything to do with it — total teetotallers — but they are coming up with these ideas surrounding how alcohol should be served,” he said.

Maitland has spent the last decade working to change laws about distilleries and breweries and helping the North Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association develop policies surrounding alcohol.

Maitland said the change will likely be “inconsequential” when it comes to bar revenue but will make things easier for owners and bartenders, simplifying operations for bars across the state.

“It can make things easier when there's lovely people walking in, and you can just say, 'What can I get you?' instead of, 'Are you a member?'"" Mesigian said.

Atlas bar manager Brian Toomey said the change will make his job easier. Toomey has been the manager at Atlas since it opened earlier this year as well as a bartender at ACME Food & Beverage Company for 20 years.

“We're happy about it, it's just been a law that really has made no sense for all of my working career and it really just makes it so much easier,” he said. “We don’t have that hassle all the time, when we’re busy, to sign people up.”

In the same week, additional changes were made to bar and liquor laws in North Carolina.

Senate Bill 470 states that bar areas are no longer subject to health inspection except for the preparation of garnishes for alcoholic beverages, and it is no longer necessary for establishments to maintain kitchen operations while it is open to the public.

Under previous law, if the kitchen were to close in an establishment at any time, it would legally be defined as a private bar instead of a restaurant.

That last change is the one Maitland is most excited about, as it will have the greatest effect on TOPO.

“Keeping the kitchen open made sense politically, but man, it was a disaster from an operations perspective,” he said.

Maitland can now keep his kitchen open only as long as people are ordering food and close it later in the night, which he said will save him money.

Mesigian said that while the change will simplify operations, she and her staff enjoyed the “accountability” that came with memberships because people had to pay a small fee to join the OCSC community. She said she and her staff briefly discussed continuing memberships but ultimately decided not to.

“We just need to adapt and move on and just stay true to ourselves in that we like to keep Orange County Social Club a place that people feel good in and as comfortable as possible,” she said.

https://richmond.com/news/local/popularity-of-baby-vaccines-is-low-but-it-s-higher-in-virginia-than-other-states/article_4fc19abf-e0c0-5aab-a9ef-a0fa918f3a55.html,"Baby vaccine uptake is low, but it’s higher in Virginia than national average","About 21,000 babies and toddlers in Virginia have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in the three weeks since the shots were made available. That’s not a high number — it’s almost 5% of the state population for tots ages 4 and younger.

But it’s better than the national average, which reached 2% last week.

The low numbers reflect the trepidation of parents waiting to see how the shots perform, the relatively few babies and toddlers who develop severe illness and a general sense of disregard for the more than 2-year-old pandemic — despite rising hospitalizations and the emergence of the BA.5 variant.

“It is low,” said Christy Gray, Virginia’s vaccine coordinator. “But there are reasons, and we did anticipate it would be a lower uptake.”

On the other side of the equation are parents who are quickly signing up their kids for shots and analyzing the pros and cons of Moderna and Pfizer. Pediatricians are largely choosing Pfizer for its familiarity, but some parents are chasing down doses of the faster-immunizing Moderna.

So far, roughly 400,000 babies and toddlers in the U.S. have received a COVID shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s about 2% of the 19.5 million American children under the age of 5.

And it’s well below the 1 in 5 parents who told a Kaiser Family Foundation poll they would vaccinate their children immediately.

But it’s been only three weeks, and the number of vaccinated babies is growing. At clinics offered by the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts, every clinic has operated at capacity, a spokesperson said.

Vaccination rate lowest in school-age kids

Based on the vaccination rate of other age groups, the number of babies and toddlers getting shots might remain low. The vaccination rate of elementary school-age children is lower than every other age group in Virginia.

Among kids and young adults ages 12 to 34, the vaccination rate is fairly consistent; between 76% and 79% have gotten at least one shot. For kids ages 5 to 11, there’s a steep drop-off. Only 45% of them have gotten one shot or more.

There are a few factors at play here. Children and young adults are less likely to develop severe disease from a COVID infection, and vaccines for kids haven’t been available as long.

But parents who think their kids are somehow protected from hospitalization are wrong. In the past 13 weeks, as subvariants of omicron have spread through the state, more children ages 0 to 9 have been hospitalized than adolescents and teens ages 10 to 19.

COVID is still hitting the oldest in society the hardest. The vast majority of recent hospitalizations in Virginia — 82% — were for patients ages 50 and up.

When you look at hospital patients below the age of 50, there isn’t a big difference between the number of kids and young adults. There have been 78 patients in their 40s and 59 patients under the age of 10.

Omicron and its subvariants have disproportionately affected younger kids, who are less vaccinated or not vaccinated, said Dr. Mark Grabill, a pediatrician with Pediatric Associates of Richmond. The populace is less likely to participate in prevention measures such as masking, and the state health department no longer recommends masks in schools, day cares and summer camps.

“Masks came off, and things seemed to resume back to normal,” Grabill said.

The type of illness kids are developing has changed with recent variants, too, Grabill said. Lately, kids have displayed flu-like symptoms — fevers up to 104 degrees, fatigue, body aches, nose symptoms, cough and a sore throat. A few have been hospitalized with breathing issues.

That’s a change from earlier in the pandemic when cold-like symptoms, including congestion and cough, were more common. The BA.5 variant has been blamed for the current uptick in hospitalizations in the state and across the country. Many of the infected were previously vaccinated.

While kids have been hospitalized at rates similar to young adults, kids haven’t died at the same rate. There have been eight COVID deaths in the state in the past three months among patients in their 40s. Among kids 0 to 9, there’s been one. Deaths from COVID have been relatively low since the original omicron wave ended in February.

Across all age groups, interest in vaccination has been low this year. There was a jump in April when second boosters were authorized but, overall, many young people are unwilling to get the shot. According to a recent poll by Morning Consult, 27% of adults ages 18 to 34 have no plans to get a vaccine, which is higher than other age groups.

Among parents who have babies and toddlers, these individuals are more likely to wait and see how vaccine distribution goes before signing up their own kids, Grabill said.

“I think parents are understandably hesitant,” he said. “But I think we have really good data from the trials to show it’s a safe vaccine, and we’re recommending it when parents come into our office.”

While vaccinated adults are still catching the BA.5 subvariant this summer, experts say the baby vaccines are good at warding off severe disease.

There are other simple reasons why some parents haven’t signed up. Some haven’t found the time in the first three weeks, and others are still planning out the shot schedule. Moderna recipients get two doses four weeks apart, and Pfizer recipients receive two doses three weeks apart and a third shot eight weeks after the second. And some parents may not be aware of baby vaccines yet.

It’s hard to say how Virginia compares with other states, as state-by-state data is still hard to find. North Carolina and Maryland have not yet published their vaccination numbers for kids under 5.

Some parents seeking Moderna

For the first time, parents have a choice of which vaccine to give their children. Before June, Pfizer was the only shot approved for kids ages 5 to 17.

For some parents, Moderna is the shot of choice. At the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts, where more than 330 tots have been vaccinated, more parents have requested Moderna than Pfizer, a spokesperson said.

That might be because more pediatricians ordered Pfizer shots, making them easier to access across the state. Many pediatricians ordered Pfizer because they had been offering it to older kids for months, and their employees were accustomed to the storage and delivery procedures.

As of Wednesday, the Virginia Department of Health has ordered roughly 82,000 Pfizer vaccines and 57,000 Moderna vaccines, a spokesperson for the department said.

Another reason parents are seeking Moderna is because the regimen requires just two shots four weeks apart. Recipients of Pfizer receive two doses three weeks apart and a third dose eight weeks after the second.

To get her 4½-year-old son immunized with Moderna, Henrico County resident Sarah Reyes carpooled with a friend and drove to Charlottesville. They had been unable to find an availability for Moderna shots in town that fit her schedule. On the state health department’s website for finding vaccines, Reyes located a pediatrician’s office, Piedmont Pediatrics, that had Moderna shots available on a Saturday.

“I wanted the two shots and to be done,” Reyes said.

Getting her son, Evan, vaccinated means he won’t have to quarantine from day care every time he is exposed to someone with the virus. While day cares have implemented different policies, Reyes’ day care asks for unvaccinated children to quarantine after an exposure. Vaccinated children can continue attending but might be asked to take a test.

Plenty of parents have been happy to take either shot, said Grabill, the pediatrician. His office requested Pfizer, and most parents he’s seen haven’t expressed a preference for one shot or the other. Experts recommend both Moderna and Pfizer.

Kids who are prone to developing fevers may better suited for Pfizer, Grabill said. In trials, about one in six children developed a fever of 100.4 degrees or more.

Megan Fuller of Midlothian signed up her 14-month-old twin sons for a Moderna vaccine trial, where they will receive two shots of a modified vaccine designed specifically for the omicron variant. Moderna could eventually recommend a third shot for all its baby and toddler vaccine recipients.

To Fuller, Moderna was the better choice, not only because of the faster immunity, but because of the starts and stops that slowed Pfizer’s path to approval. Last year, Pfizer planned just two shots for its baby vaccine, but the results fell short of expectation, the company said. In February, rollout of the shot was delayed, and a third dose was added.

“I just have more confidence in Moderna,” Fuller said. “It feels like Pfizer has had a lot of back and forth.”",Q3
https://apnews.com/ebf5963c3cee971c818b63fbb0d957e6,Texas executes man for slaying of Dallas real estate agent,"HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — Texas on Wednesday put to death a man who fatally stabbed a suburban Dallas real estate agent more than 16 years ago, the second execution this year in what has been the nation’s busiest death penalty state.

Kosoul Chanthakoummane, 41, received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville and was pronounced dead at 6:33 p.m. He was condemned for fatally stabbing 40-year-old Sarah Walker in July 2006. She was found stabbed more than 30 times in a model home in McKinney, about 30 miles (48 km) north of Dallas.

In a brief statement after he was strapped to the death chamber gurney, Chanthakoummane thanked Jesus Christ, ministers with the Texas prison system and “all these people in my life that aided me in this journey.”

Although no relatives of Walker attended the execution, he offered a message to them: “I pray my death will bring them peace.”

As the 5 grams of the powerful sedative pentobarbital began flowing through IV lines into veins in each of his arms, he looked toward a window through which his mother quietly watched a few feet away and mouthed, “Mom, I love you.”

He then took four breaths, gasped slightly and there was no further movement. He was pronounced dead 15 minutes later.

Just before the execution took place and at Chanthakoummane’s request, a Buddhist monk placed his right hand on the inmate’s chest and read a passage from the Book of Ecclesiastes that refers to “a time for everything.” He responded: “Amen.”

Prosecutors say Chanthakoummane entered the model home and then beat Walker with a wooden plant stand and stabbed her before stealing her Rolex watch and a silver ring, which were never found. DNA evidence showed Chanthakoummane’s blood was found in various places inside the model home, including under Walker’s fingernails.

Walker had been a top-seller for home builder D.R. Horton. She had two children.

Chanthakoummane had acknowledged he was in the model home but said he only went inside to get a drink of water. He had been on parole in Texas after serving time in North Carolina for aggravated kidnapping and robbery.

“I am innocent,” Chanthakoummane had said in a letter filed in federal court in March.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals declined to delay Chanthakoummane’s execution after his attorneys had challenged the DNA evidence used to convict him. The evidence had been described by the appeals court as the “linchpin of the state’s case.” Eric Allen, one of his attorneys, said earlier Wednesday he wouldn’t file a final appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court.

His attorneys had argued new science raised the possibility Chanthakoummane’s DNA could have been transferred to Walker’s fingernails without any direct contact between the two.

But authorities said prior DNA testing in his case had failed to clear Chanthakoummane.

“Any belief by Chanthakoummane that further DNA investigation would yield results that will be helpful to his case is a fantasy,” lawyers with the Texas Attorney General’s Office wrote in court documents last month.

On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles had declined to grant Chanthakoummane either a 120-day reprieve or a commutation of his death sentence to a lesser penalty.

Chanthakoummane’s attorneys said their concerns about the DNA evidence was part of a pattern by prosecutors in using faulty evidence in the case.

At Chanthakoummane’s trial, a forensic dentist testified the death row inmate was the source of a bite mark on Walker’s neck. Such bitemark evidence has since been discredited and in 2016, Texas became the first state to call for banning bite mark analysis in criminal cases.

The two witnesses who said they saw Chanthakoummane near the murder scene were hypnotized by officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety, or DPS, to help identify him.

A 2020 report by the Dallas Morning News found most Texas judges still allow evidence derived from hypnosis despite criticism it can distort memories and lead to wrongful convictions. In January 2021, DPS stopped using hypnosis. Last year, Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed a bill that would have banned people who have been hypnotized from testifying in a criminal trial.

In October 2020, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that while the bitemark testimony would no longer be admissible in court, Chanthakoummane’s attorneys had failed to discredit the hypnosis-related testimony.

The appeals court also found the DNA evidence was still strong.

At his trial, Chanthakoummane’s attorney, Keith Gore, told jurors his client was guilty “and he wanted to rob (Walker), and it didn’t go the right way, and he killed her.”

Walker’s father, Joseph Walker, who died last year, had opposed Chanthakoummane’s execution and had told the Times Union in New York in 2013 he had forgiven his daughter’s killer.

Chanthakoummane was the ninth inmate put to death this year in the U.S.

While Texas has been the nation’s busiest capital punishment state, the use of the death penalty in the state has reached near historic lows. Juries have continued to issue fewer death sentences and in the last couple of years most executions have been delayed by the pandemic or by legal questions over what spiritual advisers can do in the death chamber.

(JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla.) — The ex-wife of slain Microsoft executive Jared Bridegan has been indicted for first-degree murder in what Florida prosecutors called the “cold, calculated and premeditated murder” of the father of four.

Shanna Gardner was indicted by a grand jury on Thursday for first-degree murder, a capital felony, as well as conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and child abuse, prosecutors said.

Bridegan, 33, was shot and killed in the middle of a Jacksonville Beach street last year in what authorities described as a targeted ambush.

Gardner was arrested in West Richland, Washington, and will be extradited to Duval County, authorities said. Her last name has been previously reported as Gardner-Fernandez, though the indictment and prosecutors refer to her as Gardner.

Her attorney declined to comment to ABC News.

Gardner denied any involvement in her ex-husband’s murder last year during her only television interview.

“Any time divorce comes into any situation it’s messy,” she told Jacksonville station WJAX in July 2022.

“Even though we didn’t always get along, he was still the father of my kids,” she said.

Gardner is the third person to be charged in connection with the homicide.

Her current husband, Mario Fernandez Saldana, was indicted by a grand jury on multiple charges, including first-degree murder, five months ago. Fernandez Saldana’s former tenant, Henry Tenon, was arrested earlier this year and is accused of pulling the trigger.

“This investigation has uncovered the truth of Jared’s murder,” State Attorney Melissa Nelson, who is prosecuting the case, said during a press briefing Thursday. “Henry Tenon did not act alone. Mario Fernandez did not plan alone, and Shanna Gardner’s indictment acknowledges her central and key role in the cold, calculated and premeditated murder of Jared Bridegan.”

Bridegan was driving his then-2-year-old daughter in Jacksonville Beach in February 2022 when he came upon a tire blocking his path, police said. When he stepped out of the car, authorities said he was ambushed and murdered.

Nearly a year later, in January 2023, Tenon was arrested in connection with the fatal shooting. He has since pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is cooperating with prosecutors.

Fernandez Saldana was charged with first-degree murder in March in connection with Bridegan’s death and has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty in his case.

Nelson has previously said the tenant-landlord relationship was the “single link” tying Tenon to Bridegan.

Prosecutors will also seek the death penalty against Gardner, authorities said.

“We promised at the outset of this investigation, we would not relent until we uncovered the truth of Jared’s murder,” Nelson said.

The night he was killed, Bridegan was driving home after dropping off twins he shares with his ex-wife when he came upon the tire and was shot, police said.

Bridegan also had two children with his wife, Kirsten Bridegan — the then-2-year-old and a younger daughter who was home with his wife at the time of the shooting.

Gardner’s parents responded to her indictment on Thursday.

“Words cannot accurately express the depth of our sadness,” her parents, Shelli and Sterling Gardner, said. “Family is our top priority. We love our daughter and are focused on supporting her and our entire family as we help our grandchildren navigate this difficult and very confusing time.”

“For their sake and all involved, we caution against further speculation and request privacy as the legal process runs its course,” they added.

We applaud Reps. Burchett, Cooper, Cohen, and Harshbarger for backing the Big Cat Public Safety Act that will help keep families and children in suburbia safe from dangerous big cats.” — Marty Irby, executive director at Animal Wellness Action

NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, UNITED STATES , August 2, 2022 /EINPresswire.com/ -- With the support of the national law enforcement, animal welfare, and conservation and mainstream zoological communities, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the Big Cat Public Safety Act, H.R. 263, on Friday by a vote of 278 to 134. H.R. 263 was introduced by bipartisan Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Mike Quigley, R-Ill., and was actively supported on the floor by Reps. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, Jim Cooper, D-Nashville, Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, and Diana Harshbarger, R-Kingsport, who were all cosponsors of the bill.

“Breeders who pump out countless big cats for cub-petting are worse than puppy millers, placing unfunded mandates on animal rescues who have to clean up their mess and care for these majestic creatures once they’ve grown too big to exploit,” said Marty Irby, executive director at Animal Wellness Action, and a past president of the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' & Exhibitors' Association. “We applaud Reps. Burchett, Cooper, Cohen, and Harshbarger for backing the Big Cat Public Safety Act that will help keep families and children in suburbia safe from dangerous big cats.""

The bill builds on the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, passed unanimously in 2003, that sought to ban the trade in big cats as pets. That original measure had a drafting flaw, and the Big Cat Public Safety Act seeks to correct that problem and to ban breeding big cats for the pet trade or for commercial cub petting.

The bill had been introduced long before the salacious reality television series “Tiger King,” but that series put the issue of private ownership of tigers and lions on the American radar screen. NBC’s streaming platform, Peacock TV, also featured the bill in its series “Joe vs. Carole,” released in March.

Law enforcement swung in force behind the bill.

“I’ve experienced the worst-case scenario first-hand, and it is a gut-wrenching experience to think about tigers, lions, and other big cats on the prowl in such close proximity to our homes and our schools,” said Sheriff Matt Lutz from Zanesville, Ohio, whose office was forced to respond to a mass release of tigers, lions, and other animals in his community more than a decade ago.

Down from nearly 60 cub-petting operations just 10 or 15 years ago, there are now maybe two or three commercial cub petting outfits in the United States. Nearly all cub-petters featured in “Tiger King” are incarcerated, have had their animals seized, or are facing prosecution.

-Joe Exotic is serving 21 years in federal prison for 17 wildlife-related charges as well as murder for hire charges

-Jeff Lowe, who took charge of Joe Exotic’s GW Zoo and intended to open a cub-petting operation in far eastern Oklahoma, had his operation raided by federal authorities, who brought civil charges against him. Lowe’s animals have been confiscated and placed at sanctuaries.

-Tim Stark, another prominent Tiger King “star,” had his animals confiscated by the State of Indiana for multiple animal-related and nonprofit-operation violations. He fled the state after a criminal charge was filed and was arrested in New York.

-Bhagavan “Doc” Antle was arrested on charges of money laundering. He’s also facing charges by the State of Virginia with 15 counts of wildlife trafficking and animal cruelty.

The tigers and lions bred for the pet trade or roadside attractions never lead good lives. They typically live in substandard conditions, and in almost every case, their lives end tragically. We reduce these remarkable beasts to shadows of themselves in dilapidated roadside menageries or in backyards or basements. The people who acquire the animals on impulse or for profit almost always give them up because they cannot be safely managed by individuals without sufficient resources or professional staff.

U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., led efforts to block the bill, denigrating the idea of even bringing the bill up for a vote but then suggesting that the Department of Agriculture should handle the problem. USDA is singularly ill-equipped to handle the trade in endangered lions and tigers.

H.R. 263 is backed by the National Sheriffs’ Association, state sheriffs’ associations throughout the nation, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Animal Care and Control Association, and countless other agencies and organizations. A Senate companion bill, S. 1210, has nearly 50 cosponsors.

Animal Wellness Action (Action) is a Washington, D.C.-based 501(c)(4) organization with a mission of helping animals by promoting legal standards forbidding cruelty. We champion causes that alleviate the suffering of companion animals, farm animals, and wildlife. We advocate for policies to stop dogfighting and cockfighting and other forms of malicious cruelty and to confront factory farming and other systemic forms of animal exploitation. To prevent cruelty, we promote enacting good public policies and we work to enforce those policies. To enact good laws, we must elect good lawmakers, and that’s why we remind voters which candidates care about our issues and which ones don’t. We believe helping animals helps us all.

Thursday afternoon, the East Coast Gaming Congress was to have included a panel discussion on casino smoking, an issue that is roiling workers, customers and lawmakers not only in New Jersey but in states including Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and others.

It was scrapped when the casino industry representative, Resorts Casino President Mark Giannantonio, withdrew. He recently became president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, the Atlantic City casinos' trade association which vehemently opposes a smoking ban.

“The CANJ is running and hiding right now,” said Peter Naccarelli, a Borgata dealer and a leader of a push by casino workers to ban smoking in their workplaces. “They have no logical arguments.”

Lamont White, another Borgata dealer opposed to smoking, said the casino industry's main argument has always been, “We'd lose money, and money is more important than casino workers lives.”

“That's all they have to say,” he said.

Giannantonio declined comment on Thursday's demonstration, referring a reporter to a statement the casino association issued earlier this month in which it said ""an immediate smoking ban would have a significant adverse effect on Atlantic City.”

Murphy, the state's Democratic governor, has promised to sign the bill if it passes. But Legislative leaders have thus far refused to set a hearing date for a committee in either the Senate or Assembly, which has to happen before the bill can move forward.

Murphy addressed Thursday's conference, but did not mention the proposed ban in any detail.

But during an afternoon session, Eric Hausler, CEO of Greenwood Racing, which owns Pennsylvania's smoke-free Parx casino, said that policy has been successful.

“So far, so good,” he said.

When reopening in 2020 after the initial wave of the pandemic, Hausler said, Parx decided to remain smoke-free, “for better or worse. If you look at our market share numbers, they're holding up just fine. We intend to stay that way. Our customers have gotten used to it.""",Q3

Photo: Marilyn Bechtel / PW

Over 2,000 striking mental health clinicians hit the picket lines in front of Kaiser Permanente facilities in northern California and the Central Valley on the morning of 29th August, as they began the third week of a strike demanding the giant Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO) staff up in order to provide timely mental health care to its millions of enrolled patients.

And on that day, the psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, addiction medicine counsellors, and marriage and family counsellors, members of the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW), were joined by dozens of colleagues in Hawaii who face even greater understaffing issues.

In northern California and the Central Valley – where Kaiser maintains one clinician for every 2,600 patients – the clinicians’ contract expired last September. In Hawaii, where Kaiser staffs one clinician for every 5,500 patients, the HMO has repeatedly put negotiations on hold since the therapists first formed their union in 2018.

Picketing in front of Kaiser’s flagship Oakland Medical Center was licensed clinical social worker Ilana Marcucci-Morris, a member of NUHW’s Bargaining Committee, who sees patients when they first seek mental health care.

Mental health “is a physical health problem. We need to treat it like a physical health problem,” she said. “I’m here to make sure community mental health is here. A multibillion-dollar profiteer like Kaiser has the resources to do the right thing, so I’m asking them to do just that.”

When asked about Kaiser’s claims of an across-the-board shortage of mental health therapists, Marcucci-Morris responded that the real shortage is “clinicians who are willing to work for Kaiser. I have many colleagues and friends that I’ve worked with through grad school, community mental health, just plain friendships, who need and want work, but when I suggest Kaiser, they laugh at me: ‘No way! I’m not going to dig my own grave!’

“There’s not a shortage of mental health workers, there’s a shortage of mental health workers who are willing to accept the working conditions at Kaiser.”

Along the picket line, another clinician remarked on the long history of the struggle for a truly productive work environment. “We’ve been out on strike many times over the years,” she said. “Really, what we face daily is not being able to provide adequate care. We’ve been trained to do particular treatments to help people heal, and ultimately, we haven’t been able to see our patients with the consistency that’s necessary so they can receive those treatments as they were designed.”

A longtime but soon-to-be former Kaiser patient marching with the picketing clinicians described a lifelong struggle with severe illness requiring extensive medication. She spoke of having to pay out-of-pocket for the one treatment which provided major relief after she had received mixed and inaccurate messaging from Kaiser about its availability.

“I really appreciate everything the therapists and intake people are doing,” she said, “and I’m deeply moved by them not getting their salaries during this time because they believe in patient care. Now, I have other insurance that will support my care a little bit better.”

A psychologist told how she joined Kaiser’s mental health clinician staff some 22 years ago, after years as a university professor, because “the ethos of the corporation and the department I worked in was about being the best place to get care, really trying to improve mental health and health in general. We were the vanguard at Kaiser, doing things on a big, systemic level.”

But later, she said, “when we shifted to making millions and then billions, I think the whole structure changed, and instead of wanting to be the best, we wanted to make the most money. I don’t think the whole point was to give bad care, but definitely whatever was going to garner us funds.”

Now, she said, “People are dictating from a business point of view rather than an experience point of view. And I don’t think they’ve given adequate respect to the people on the line.”

Under California state laws, Kaiser is required to provide timely mental health care to its members even during a strike, a responsibility underscored before the clinicians’ current action by Mary Watanabe, director of the Department of Managed Health Care, which oversees health care providers in the state.

On 24th August, the DMHC announced that it had launched a targeted enforcement action against Kaiser, based on patient complaints that the HMO is violating those requirements during the strike’s first weeks.

NUHW President Sal Rosselli said union members were pleased the state authorities were “taking a close look” at Kaiser’s illegal denial of care and called for “rapid intervention” to enforce the laws.

“The suffering and neglect that Kaiser patients have endured over the past two weeks is unnecessary, illegal, and yet it can be easily remedied,” Rosselli said in a statement. “Kaiser’s executives need to obey the law, serve the patients and end the strike by agreeing to work with us to properly operate and staff its clinics. It’s time for Kaiser to respect the importance of mental health care and fundamentally change its approach to how it treats both patients and clinicians.”

The next day, the state legislature passed Senate Bill 858, by state Senator Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, and sponsored by the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition Health Access. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, SB 858 will ratchet up the fines health providers must pay for violating mental health parity laws from the present $2,500 to $25,000 per incident.

""My dad was angry and he threw his dinner plate and was shoving the food down her top,"" Brenda Boyd testified on Thursday.

""He was choking her and they were yelling.

""I remember holding on to her leg and yelling at my dad to stop.""

John Bowie (right) has pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife 40 years ago. (A Current Affair)

She was giving evidence at the NSW Supreme Court trial of her father, former ambulance officer, John Douglas Bowie.

The 72-year-old has pleaded not guilty to murdering Roxlyn Bowie, who was 31 when she vanished from their Walgett home in northern NSW.

The Crown alleges the former ambulance officer killed his wife on or about June 5, 1982 so he could have an unfettered relationship with another woman.

Her body has never been found.

Boyd said she was aged six on June 5 and remembered her parents arguing a little before her mother put her younger brother to bed with her help.

""I remember saying goodnight to my mother and the next morning she was not there,"" she said.

When she asked her father where she was, he read her a note he said he found.

""He said she was sorry and she had to leave and he didn't know where she was.""

The conversation was quite short and her father didn't seem upset.

""I remember crying. I was eating a pie and I remember the pie coming out of my mouth.""

Roxlyn Bowie, a mother of two, vanished in 1982. (A Current Affair)

After a few days, her father took her and her brother Warren - who has since died - to their grandparents' home in Killara, Sydney.

""I remember playing with my dolls and my father was packing up the house,"" she said.

She also remembered meeting a woman called Gail Clarke and her children, after her father told her they were going to have a new family and she would have a brother and a sister.

Earlier, the jury was read notes of a police interview on April 24, 1988 with Gail Clarke, who has since died.

The divorced woman said she met Bowie in his capacity as an ambulance officer in the May school holidays in 1982 when she was staying in a caravan on the banks of the Barwon River at Walgett.

""She was previously informed by John Bowie that he and Roxlyn led different lives, and she had a boyfriend,"" the notes said.

She said they formed a relationship for the duration of the holidays before she returned to her Sydney home.

Some weeks later he phoned her before coming to her home towards the end of June 1982.

He told her his wife had left him and suggested he move in with her.

Clarke said she refused his request, but saw him on a number of occasions before terminating the relationship after two to three weeks and never saw him again.

She said he was extremely keen to form a serious relationship but she never entertained the idea.

Boyd said her father once told her her mother had left with her boyfriend, a bank manager, while another time he said his wife told him if he went out on the night of June 5 she would not be there on his return.

Before her seventh birthday, Boyd said she, her brother and father moved into a unit with a woman called Ann whom he married.

She said the couple both drank a lot and their relationship was quite violent, involving choking, punching, kicking and screaming on both sides.

Her father once kicked her stepmother in the knee and she was in a cast for quite a while.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/18/aileen-cannon-trump-special-master-ruling/,Opinion | The Trump-appointed judge delivers the goods for her patron,"If you still had doubts that Donald Trump’s relentless court-packing poses profound challenges to the legitimacy of the judiciary, U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon’s ruling in favor of the man who appointed her should resolve them. No one is above the law, we once comforted ourselves. Even if Trump could not be indicted while he was president because of a (questionable) Justice Department policy, he would certainly face full accountability after he left office. He would be treated just like everyone else.

Nope, said Cannon. Trump is still special. He has rights no one else has because he is an ex-president. She said so right out. “Based on the nature of this action,” Cannon wrote, “the principles of equity require the Court to consider the specific context at issue, and that consideration is inherently impacted by the position formerly held by Plaintiff.”

Advertisement

Meaning that, even if no other American would enjoy the right to have a special master examine secret and top secret documents that any of the rest of us would likely be indicted for possessing, Trump is “inherently” above us. This is a ruling tailored for one man, which is not supposed to happen in a free society.

Follow E.J. Dionne Jr. Follow

Making matters worse, the judge said she had no way of assessing the government’s well-grounded claims that some of the documents in question “are classified government records,” even though Trump presented no evidence refuting them.

Trump’s assertions that, like a high priest, he magically declassified everything with a virtual wave of his hand are for talk shows, not a legal proceeding. Trump, in any event, should not have possessed documents that are the government’s property, not his.

The Justice Department could not let Cannon’s nonsense stand. It filed an emergency motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Friday night arguing that the judge “fundamentally erred” in her decision, but focusing on only about 100 documents “bearing classification markings.” The department asked that they be kept out of the special master process (and away from Trump’s lawyers) so the FBI could continue its criminal investigation and “identify and mitigate potential national security risks.”

From her first ruling earlier this month, Cannon’s judgments have been described by respected outsiders with words such as “unprecedented,” “untenable,” “radical,” “oblivious,” “deeply problematic” and “stupid.” And also “wrong” and “deeply flawed.” Those last two characterizations came from Trump’s former attorney general, William P. Barr, whose own efforts to protect the president could lead to congressional scrutiny.

Cannon’s legal antics come at an awkward time for those — led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. — who scold anyone questioning the judiciary’s legitimacy in the wake of the unparalleled efforts by Trump, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) when he was majority leader, and the conservative Federalist Society to stuff the courts with conservatives.

Roberts said earlier this month that “simply because people disagree with an opinion is not a basis for criticizing the legitimacy of the court.” Perhaps true in a vacuum, the statement is suffused with a faux innocence about how the current right-tilting Supreme Court majority — and similar majorities on many circuit courts — were created.

If McConnell and his allies had really cared about judicial legitimacy, they would not have denied Merrick Garland of even a hearing when President Barack Obama named him to the Supreme Court more than seven months before the 2016 election. (It’s either irony or tragedy that a Justice Department now lead by Attorney General Garland is battling Cannon’s Trumpfication of the law.)

Nor would conservatives have turned around four years later and rushed Justice Amy Coney Barrett through the Senate just eight days before Trump lost the 2020 election. You can’t engage in nakedly aggressive power politics and then insist: “Nothing happening here, it’s all on the level, move on.”

Not for nothing did Justice Elena Kagan point to the “problem” caused “when courts become extensions of the political process” during a visit to Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law last Wednesday. She was talking about court decisions, but her words apply as well to the process that produced a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court advantage — and judges such as Cannon.

Let’s stipulate: There’s always politics in a system involving presidential appointments and Senate confirmation. What we have not seen before is what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) calls “The Scheme,” the title of his forthcoming book on how dark money conjoined with Senate and presidential actions to transform the judiciary.

Governor Jim Justice is expected to sign it soon.

The West Virginia legislature has passed a bill to ban abortions, protecting babies starting at conception. Once the House approves the Governor Jim Justice signs the measure into law, West Virginia will become the 16th state to ban abortions.

Thankfully, even before the governor sings it, unborn babies will be protected from abortions:

After the West Virginia State Legislature passed House Bill 302, the only clinic that provides abortions in the state says they are forced to put abortions on pause, but their other services will not be affected. Women’s Health Center of West Virginia, which is in Charleston, said while it is pausing abortion services, it will not be closing and will continue to provide other services, including annual exams, birth control, cancer screenings, family planning, gender-affirming hormone therapy, pregnancy and parenting support, and STI testing and treatment.

The state legislature is holding a special session on a few political issues, including abortion. Knowing that the state’s old abortion ban is tied up in courts, supposedly for lack of clarity, Governor Jim Justice called on the legislature to pass a new abortion ban that would stand up in court following the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

“From the moment the Supreme Court announced their decision in Dobbs, I said that I would not hesitate to call a Special Session once I heard from our Legislative leaders that they had done their due diligence and were ready to act,” Justice said in a statement. “As I have said many times, I very proudly stand for life and I believe that every human life is a miracle worth protecting.”

Justice said he wanted the legislature to produce a pro-life bill to “ensure a coherent, comprehensive framework governing abortions and attendant family services and support to expecting mothers to provide the citizens of this State more certainty in the application of such laws.”

Today, the state Senate took the first step.

House Bill 302 passed by a vote of 22-7, with five members absent. The bill would ban abortions from being performed or induced unless they are recommended by the “reasonable judgement of a licensed medical professional” for reasons such as non-medically viable fetus, ectopic pregnancy or medical emergencies. The bill contains exceptions for victims of incest and sexual assault, with several stipulations, according to Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo, R-Kanawha. Adults who are victims of incest and sexual assault will be able to seek an exemption to the law for up to eight weeks. Adult victims must report the crime to law enforcement, and law enforcement must provide the report to the medical professional performing the procedure, Takubo said. Minors may seek an exemption for up to 14 weeks, Takubo said. “For this exception, at least one of the following must occur: either 1) a report of sexual assault or incest must be made to law enforcement or 2) the patient must obtain medial treatment for the sexual assault or incest by a licensed medial professional…” he said.

After the Senate vote, the state House approved the ban by a 78-17 vote. Delegates Jim Barach, Mick Bates, Chad Lovejoy, Carl Martin and Johnnie Wamsley did not vote.

The bill also also limits where abortions can be provided, restricting them to medical facilities licensed by the state Office of Health Facility Licensure and Certification. That means the state’s only abortion business would have to close down and any abortions would to save a mother’s life would be done in an hospital which is better equipped to handle medical emergencies.

The bill would hold abortionists accountable for killing babies by revoking their medical licenses and criminal penalties come into play when a non-medical professional kills a baby in an abortion. Women are not subject to criminal penalties under the law.

The statewide pro-life group informed LifeNews ahead of the vote that it supports the legislation, even though it would have preferred stronger wording protecting more babies and more accountability.

“West Virginians for Life (WVFL) is happy to announce that it supports the updated version of HB 302, the bill to clarify abortion laws in WV. This bill, while not perfect, will protect most babies and their mothers from abortion. It provides for abortion in limited circumstances – life of the mother, medical emergencies, and reported rape and incest. It excludes ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, and IVF,” it confirmed.

“Thank you so much for working with us to protect unborn babies and their mothers during this historic moment in history,” it added.

“West Virginians have been committed to protecting unborn children and mothers from the horrors of abortion and now, in the Dobbs era, they have passed legislation to do just that. HB 302 is a strong pro-life bill that will protect babies and ensure mothers can get the care they need in the heartbreaking situation of an ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage or medical emergency – just like every other state with pro-life protections in place,” said Caitlin Connors, southern regional director for SBA Pro-Life America. “While the abortion industry ran to the courts to block West Virginia’s protections for life, the legislature has now made clear the will of the people in the Mountain State is with unborn babies and their moms. This law will save thousands of lives in West Virginia.”

As LifeNews reported, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, with a 6-3 majority ruling in the Dobbs case that “The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion” — allowing states to ban abortions and protect unborn babies. The high court also ruled 6-3 uphold the Mississippi 15-week abortion ban so states can further limit abortions and to get rid of the false viability standard.

Chief Justice John Roberts technically voted for the judgment but, in his concurring opinion, disagreed with the reasoning and said he wanted to keep abortions legal but with a new standard.

Texas and Oklahoma had banned abortions before Roe was overturned and Missouri became the first state after Roe to protect babies from abortions and South Dakota became the 2nd. Then Arkansas became the third state protecting babies from abortions and Kentucky became the 4th and Louisiana became the 5th and Ohio became the 6th and Utah became the 7th and Oklahoma became the 8th and Alabama became the 9th. This week, Mississippi became the 10th and South Carolina became the 11th,Texas became the 12th with its pre-Roe law and Tennessee became the 13th.

Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia have old pro-life laws on the books but there is question about whether they are applicable and will be enforced.

Ultimately, as many as 26 states could immediately or quickly ban abortions and protect babies from certain death for the first time in nearly 50 years.

The 13 total states with trigger laws that would effectively ban all or most abortions are: Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

“Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,” Alito wrote.

“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences,” Alito wrote. “And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”

Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer authored a joint dissent condemning the decision as enabling states to enact “draconian” restrictions on women.

Polls show Americans are pro-life on abortion and a new national poll shows 75% of Americans essentially agree with the Supreme Court overturning Roe.

Despite false reports that abortion bans would prevent doctors from treating pregnant women for miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies, pro-life doctors confirm that is not the case. Some 35 states have laws making it clear that miscarriage is not abortion and every state with an abortion ban allows treatment for both.",Q3

Lawmakers patterned the bill, at Newsom's request, after a Texas law allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides or assists in providing an abortion. The Supreme Court gave preliminary approval to the Texas law, but California's law will automatically be invalidated if the Texas law is ever ruled unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court's support for the Texas law was ""a terrible decision,"" Newsom said. However, ""if they're going to use this framework to put women's lives at risk, we're going to use it to save people's lives here in the state of California.""

Newsom also placed $30,000 worth of full-page advertisements in three Texas newspapers Friday criticizing what he said is Gov. Greg Abbott's hypocrisy on gun safety. The ads parrot a comment by Abbott about children's right to life but substitute ""gun violence"" where he said ""abortion.""

A combination of gun owner advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union have criticized Newsom for creating what they said amounts to a bounty system to encourage such lawsuits. The ACLU called California's law ""an attack on the Constitution"" for deliberately trying to sidestep judicial review by empowering enforcement by citizens and not governments, and for undermining due process rights.

""It's all about these two big issues that are facing us. And you can't have a double standard. You can't have one standard for guns and another standard for women's reproductive health. It's not right,"" state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, a Democrat who carried the bill, said in an interview.

GROUPS BACK BILL

Gun control advocacy organizations Moms Demand Action and affiliated Students Demand Action backed the bill's potential to combat untraceable ""ghost guns.""

Newsom signed the bill at Santa Monica College, where five victims were killed in 2013 by a gunman using a ghost gun.

The new law ""will make it easier for victims of ghost gun violence like myself to help enforce our laws,"" said Mia Tretta, who was shot in Santa Clarita during a 2019 attack at Saugus High School. She is now an incoming senior and a volunteer with Students Demand Action.

Newsom grew emotional as Tretta introduced him. He later said he couldn't help but recall her optimism as he visited her in the hospital after an attack that he said personalized the danger for him as the father of a preteen daughter himself.

Aside from the merits of the bill, opponents say it is written to discourage any legal challenges to California's myriad gun regulations by requiring plaintiffs or lawyers to pay attorneys' fees if they lose the lawsuit.

That portion of the law ""is intended to make it impossible to file a Second Amendment challenge to an unconstitutional gun control law. That is itself unconstitutional,"" said Chuck Michel, president of the California Rifle and Pistol Association.

Newsom acted a day after he signed eight other gun laws among numerous measures adding to California's already strict regulations.

They encourage the safe storage of firearms and limit gun-making, including with a 3-D printer.

Others bar gun sales on state property, boost inspections of gun dealers, limit dealer fees and add child and elder abuse to the list of crimes that block gun ownership.

The governor recently signed another bill patterned after a New York law that empowers anyone who suffered harm to sue gun-makers or dealers who fail to follow precautions under a ""firearm industry standard of conduct.""

He further criticized the high court and conservative Republicans in a video message after he signed two earlier gun bills into law, one also addressing ghost guns and the other barring marketing firearms to minors.

California and New York also are scrambling to update their laws regulating the concealed carrying of firearms after the nation's high court ruled that Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called lawmakers there back into a special session to approve changes that take effect Sept. 1, including requiring gun owners to allow an examination of their social media accounts. California legislators expect to act in August on concealed carry restrictions.

https://www.businessinsider.com/bomber-demo-before-wwii-showed-navies-vulnerability-to-air-attack-2022-7,A first-of-its-kind bomber test 20 years before World War II spelled the beginning of the end of the battleship era,"In July 1921, US aircraft demonstrated how air attacks could swiftly dispatch modern warships.

The tests were an early glimpse of the changes aviation would bring to naval warfare.

The impact of those changes was seen in battles across Europe and the Pacific during World War II.

World War II may have definitively proved that battleships and other big-gun surface warships were no longer the dominant naval weapons, but the battleship's days were numbered well before the start of the war.

In a high-profile test that culminated on July 21, 1921, aviators led by Brig. Gen. William ""Billy"" Mitchell sank three captured German warships — demonstrating once and for all the advantage that aircraft have against warships.

The test embarrassed the Navy and its significance was hotly debated, making it one of the earliest examples of US military inter-service rivalry. It was also a glimpse of the tactics that would transform naval warfare over the following decades.

Battleships vs. airpower

After HMS Dreadnought entered service in 1906, battleships were considered the sovereigns of the seas. As military aviation matured, some believed aircraft were bound to play a larger role in combat at sea — including Mitchell, an airpower advocate.

A distinguished pilot who proved his command skills and the utility of airpower at the Battle of St. Mihiel in 1918, Mitchell wanted the US military to have an independent flying branch. (He is now considered the father of the US Air Force.)

Mitchell also argued that aircraft were better suited to defend US coasts than battleships, which he believed were prohibitively expensive. For the same price, Mitchell said, the Army could buy hundreds or thousands of aircraft that could swarm and sink enemy battleships — something aircraft had never actually done before.

To defend its role and its shipbuilding plans, the Navy tried to refute Mitchell with its own test on USS Indiana, a battleship built in the 1890s.

Indiana sunk after being hit repeatedly during the test in November 1920, but it was later revealed that the Navy dropped dummy bombs filled with sand and detonated explosives separately to sink the ship.

A year later, Mitchell was assistant chief of the US Army Air Service — the precursor to the US Army Air Corps — and took his arguments to Congress.

""All we want to do is to have you gentlemen watch us attack a battleship,"" he said at a hearing in January 1921. ""Give us the warships to attack, and come watch it.""

Project B

Captured German cruiser Frankfurt being bombed as a target for US aircraft during a test in July 1921. US Naval History and Heritage Command

After much pressure and publicity, the Navy begrudgingly agreed to a joint Army-Navy test, dubbed Project B. Four captured German warships and the obsolete battleship USS Iowa would be used as target ships for Army and Navy S.E.5 fighters, F5Ls flying boats, and NBS-1 and Handley Page O/400 bombers.

The Navy set a number of odd conditions, seemingly to ensure the test's failure.

The aircraft couldn't use torpedoes, could only use certain bomb loads on each mission, and were only allowed two direct hits with their 1,100-pound bombs. Inspections would be conducted between bombing runs, and the ships also had to be sunk some 50 miles from the Virginia Capes, limiting the time the aircraft could spend in the target area.

Mitchell's 1st Provisional Air Brigade was undeterred. The unit trained to drop its bombs around the ships instead of on them, believing that the water would magnify the shockwaves. The Air Service also prepared a batch of 2,000-pound bombs for the test.

The Navy conducted the first test on June 21, when 12 bombs from Navy F5Ls sank the submarine U-117. The next test, on June 29, saw Navy aircraft drop 80 dummy bombs on the Iowa. Only two found their mark, bolstering beliefs that no battleship could be sunk from the air.

On July 13, Mitchell's unit finally took part, attacking the destroyer SMS G-102. S.E.5 fighters first conducted strafing runs, hitting the deck 25 times with 25-pound bombs to demonstrate that they could clear a ship's deck of sailors and anti-aircraft weapons. Then, 16 NBS-1 bombers dropped 32 300-pound bombs, making four making direct hits and sinking the destroyer in 19 minutes.

Because G-102 was a small ship, sinking it with bombs wasn't considered a groundbreaking accomplishment. Five days later, however, Mitchell's unit sank the SMS Frankfurt, a modern light cruiser, with 600-pound bombs.

The coup de grâce came on July 20. As high-ranking observers looked on, the modern battleship SMS Ostfriesland was attacked by Army and Navy aircraft. Multiple hits by 230- and 600-pound bombs did little damage to Ostfriesland's superstructure, but near-misses damaged its hull and caused it to list five degrees to port.

The test was paused because of a storm, but the next morning Army NBS-1 bombers scored three direct hits with 1,100-pound bombs. The Navy ordered a halt to assess the damage, preventing Mitchell's men from finishing off the battleship. A few hours later, the bombers returned with 2,000-pound bombs.

To prevent the Navy from stopping the test again, Mitchell ordered his men to drop the bombs in the water close to the Ostfriesland instead of on the ship itself. Three of the six bombs detonated close enough to rip holes in the hull. Twenty-two minutes later, the battleship rolled over and sank.

Mitchell's vindication

Project B proved Mitchell's argument that modern battleships could be sunk by aircraft. The Navy disputed its relevance, arguing that Mitchell's aircraft had sunk stationary ships that had no active defenses and needed considerable resources to do it.

A joint Army-Navy Board report a month after the test said battleships were still ""the backbone of the fleet and the bulwark of the nation's sea defense"" and would be so as long as ""safe navigation of the sea"" was required for commerce and conflict.

The sinking of the battleship USS Alabama in a similar test in September didn't change any minds, and the 1st Provisional Air Brigade was subsequently disbanded.

Mitchell continued aggressively arguing his case for airpower and for an independent military flying branch. In 1923, he warned that the US naval base at Pearl Harbor was vulnerable to a Japanese air attack. His outspokenness led to his demotion and court martial in 1925.

Ultimately, World War II proved Mitchell correct about the transformative role of airpower in naval warfare — a role that only grew with technological advances during the war.

The British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto was a model for the Japanese attack on US ships at Pearl Harbor. British aircraft were also crucial to defeating the German battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz.

In the Pacific, Japanese attacks on British ships and later Allied victories at Coral Sea and Midway confirmed that aircraft were the dominant naval weapon.

There was a battle during the Revolutionary War called the Bennington Battle, but it wasn't actually fought in the Vermont town.

The battle was fought just over the border in New York. The objective of the British army was to reach the Continental Army's arms depot in Bennington.

Nonetheless, the entire day has become immortalized as a holiday when state offices are closed and entrance to state historic sites are free.

A little history lesson

In August of 1777, British Gen. John Burgoyne was marching his troops towards Albany, New York, following recapturing Fort Ticonderoga from the Americans in July.

But Burgoyne and his men needed supplies and loyalists in Canada were too far to reach him. So Burgoyne set his sights on a patriot munitions depot in Bennington.

Burgoyne sent 800 men toward Bennington under the command of German Col. Friedrich Baum. On Aug. 14 a group of American militia skirmished with the British force but lost.

In response, Vermont Brig. Gen. John Stark reinforced the Americans beaten back by the British.

Baum quickly realized he was outnumbered. He ordered the British forces to dig in where they were near Wallomsac, New York, and requested reinforcements from Burgoyne.

Early on Aug. 16, Stark ordered his men to attack the British lines. The British fought until they ran out of ammunition and then surrendered.

The victory served as a morale boost to colonial troops.

Celebrations throughout the state

Across the state, the battle victory is marked with free entrance to historic sites like the Hubbardton Battlefield, the site of the only Revolutionary War battle in Vermont, according to the Vermont Division of Historic Preservation.

Most state offices will be closed as will Burlington city offices.

If you have the day off and want to spend the day in Burlington, parking in city lots and garages are free all-day.

https://www.koaa.com/denver-boy-with-autism-epilepsy-recovering-after-he-was-shot-while-in-car-with-mother,"Denver boy with autism, epilepsy recovering after he was shot while in car with mother","DENVER — A mother is ready to see that justice is served after, while driving down a Denver road, a suspect allegedly shot at her car, striking her 13-year-old son , who has autism and epilepsy.

The boy had just finished his first day of ninth grade at Denver School of Innovation and Sustainable Design.

Kiri, the mother of the injured boy, sat down with Denver7 on a stoop near the shooting scene from the day prior. Her son, Kamorin, sat next to her, his arm in a sling. (Denver7 is honoring Kiri's request to leave out their last names.)

Kiri, a mother of four, said Kamorin is her youngest son and has autism and epilepsy, something he described as difficult.

""A lot of things scare him,"" Kiri said. ""And now I think he's just going to be scared more. But he really likes his high school and you're super excited to go back?"" Kamorin responded, ""Yeah."" He hopes to return to classes next week.

Denver7

Kiri said on Monday around 4 p.m., she was driving down E. 14th Avenue when she spotted a man she had never seen before screaming in the middle of the road around the intersection with N. Ogden Street, a few blocks northwest of Cheesman Park.

""Not saying words, just, 'Ahh!' at the cars,"" she said.

Kiri said she had to hit her brakes to avoid hitting the man. She maneuvered around him and continued down 14th.

""And then like a block down — 17 rounds,"" she said. ""(My son) was just like, 'I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding.' There was a cop driving on one of the side streets and he came to help us.""

According to the Denver Police Department, Kamorin was stable after the shooting. Denver Public Schools added that his injuries were not life-threatening.

DPD said Katrelle James, 22, was taken into custody on Monday evening along the 1000 block of E. Colfax Avenue. He is being held on investigation of attempted first-degree murder.

Kamorin, wearing a sling on Tuesday, pointed at his right arm to illustrate where the bullet had hit him. His mother explained that the bullet had entered through the back of his arm, broke his bone, came out near his bicep and entered the top of his forearm. The hospital was able to remove the bullet, Kamorin said, but he stayed in their care until midnight. His arm still hurts and he had a frightening flashback last night, he said.

In one word, he said the day was ""chaotic."" His mom added ""scary.""

""That's my baby,"" Kiri said. ""Now that I see my car, I'm just thankful that it wasn't worse.... It has a lot of bullet holes in it.""

She said the car was torn up from the gunshots and covered in blood. While she will get rid of the car, she's thankful her son is OK.

""He's the sweetest,"" Kiri said. ""For being a teenager, he's a sweet one.""

Now, she's hoping justice is served.

James appeared in a yellow jumpsuit during a virtual meeting Tuesday from the Van-Cise Simonet Detention Center in Denver.

He sobbed as the judge explained that he could face at least one, but possibly two, charges of attempted first-degree murder in connection with the shooting.

An attorney explained that James has almost no criminal history and has a place to stay with a friend. James and his mother have been trying to secure a place and her housing was recently approved, so James may be able to stay with his mom.

The attorney also said James has a job as a chef at a local restaurant and just lost a baby to miscarriage, so she requested a lower-than-scheduled bond.

The prosecutors said that the facts of the case were ""fairly aggravated,"" adding that the firearm was allegedly shot from the middle of the street at a minor.

""I think this type of incident presents a huge public safety risk,"" the people said.

They said they were not asking for a specific protection order, but for a general protection order, a guideline, cash-only bond and maximum supervision.

In the virtual meeting, Kiri asked to speak and remain anonymous.

She asked for no bond, adding that police at the scene picked up nine rounds and her car was shot four times, in addition to her son being shot. She added that her child has autism and epilepsy.

James cried into his hands upon hearing this.

""He was just in the courtroom crying,"" Kiri told Denver7 after the hearing. ""Acting like a baby, but he wasn't acting like a baby when he was shooting that 9mm in the middle of 14th.""

In the hearing, the judge said ""this does implicate a huge community safety issue."" He noted that a probable cause statement showed police had found five spent 9mm shell casings at the scene, but there may be more — ""plenty to cause mayhem"" on the street, he added.

The child was not doing anything and was simply a random victim, ""which is appalling,"" he said.

He acknowledged the mother's request for no bond, but said because nobody died, he was unable to do that. Instead, he set the guideline cash-only bond for $100,000. He also ordered James to have maximum supervision, home confinement and no possession of weapons.

Crying into his shirt, James said, ""I'm so sorry"" before walking off screen.

Scott Pribble, the director of external communications for DPS, said a mental health team is available this week at DSISD to provide support to students.

Former President Donald Trump said on Monday that FBI agents had searched his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Palm Beach, Fla., and opened his safe.

The FBI and Department of Justice declined to comment, although Eric Trump said Monday night that he was told the search was related to the possible mishandling of government secrets the Justice Department is known to be investigating after the National Archives retrieved White House records from Mar-a-Lago.

""The purpose of the raid was, from what they said, was because the National Archives wanted to corroborate whether or not Donald Trump had any documents in his possession,"" the former president's son told Fox News. ""And my father has worked so collaboratively with them for months. In fact, the lawyer that's been working on this was totally shocked. He goes, 'I have such an amazing relationship with these people and all of a sudden, on no notice, they send 20 cars and 30 agents?'""

The younger Trump said he got a call about the search being executed on Monday morning and informed his father. Neither was present and first-hand accounts of how the search was conducted were not available.

The search, which would have required a court order from a federal judge, signals the former president is under greater scrutiny from federal investigators than was previously known.

In a statement put out by his political action committee, Trump said Mar-a-Lago was ""under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" the statement said.

Trump went on to blame Democrats who don't want him to run for president in 2024 for the incident, and said the same people also want to stop Republicans from winning in the midterm elections.

Search would likely need top DOJ approval

While there is no indication that prosecutors are on the verge of charging Trump, or that he will ultimately be charged, the search marks a significant step. In order to get a warrant, investigators would have had to demonstrate to a judge that there was probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and that evidence of the crime was at Mar-a-Lago.

A search of a former president's home would likely need to be approved at the highest levels of the Justice Department. A department spokeswoman declined to comment whether Attorney General Merrick Garland had signed off on the Mar-a-Lago search.

A White House official said they did not receive notice of the search, and referred questions to the Justice Department.

While Mar-a-Lago is Trump's official residence, it's a seasonal club and the former president spends the summer months primarily up north, often at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. He was seen outside Trump Tower in New York City on Monday evening.

Earlier this year, the National Archives and Records Administration said it had recovered 15 boxes of White House records and other items from Trump's Florida club, sparking a Justice Department investigation.

Trump's announcement of the search sparked a firestorm on the right, with Republicans accusing Democrats of weaponizing the federal bureaucracy.

""The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a statement. He promised oversight of the department, should Republicans win the House in November, and warned Garland, ""preserve your documents and clear your calendar.""

Trump's 2024 plans may weigh on prosecutors

Monday's action also comes as the Justice Department was ramping up its investigations into Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election — though there have not been reports of an investigation into Trump himself.

As Trump teases another run at the White House, former federal prosecutor Brian Jacobs told NPR that another Trump candidacy could weigh on DOJ prosecutors, but wouldn't impact any potential investigations.

""I think prosecutors in the Department of Justice all know that they are not allowed to select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election,"" Jacobs said.

The prosecutor’s office cited a Maryland Attorney General’s Office report, released to the public Friday, that says officers had reason to believe there was an immediate threat to their safety during the Nov. 28 incident, making it “difficult to prove” any criminal charges against Cpl. Joseph Burger, who fired the fatal shots at 32-year-old Digno Ramon Yorro Jr.

“After reviewing all the evidence, it is clear to me that Officer Burger had a reasonable belief that his life was in danger and acted in self-defense when he shot Mr. Yorro,” Deputy State’s Attorney Brian Marsh said in an Aug. 15 letter. “Therefore, it is my conclusion that the actions taken by Officer Burger were justified and I recommend no criminal charges be considered against Officer Burger and the investigation be closed.”

The investigative report, drafted by the attorney general’s unit that investigates fatal encounters with police, says that Anne Arundel County officers responded to a Braden Loop townhouse after noon Nov. 28 for a residential alarm call. Police spoke with Yorro Jr.’s girlfriend, who said the homeowner, Valentina Yorro, was upstairs in her room and not answering calls or texts.

Yorro Jr., who was Valentina Yorro’s son, was present, and did not respond to officers who questioned him, the report says, adding that Burger told another officer that Yorro Jr. was “acting real funny” and had a knife. Both had identification cards that listed the townhouse as their current address, so officers left as they both appeared to have reason to be there, the report says. Police did not see Valentina Yorro during this encounter.

Officers returned less than an hour later when one of Yorro Jr.’s sisters, who lives out of state, called police to report her mother as missing.

When police arrived, Yorro Jr.’s girlfriend said her boyfriend had chased her out of the house with a knife and threatened her since officers were last present, that there was blood under the carpet, and that Yorro Jr. had tried to stab her when she tried to open the garage door.

She also told police Yorro Jr. had been in a fight with his mother the night before, the report adds.

Valentina Yorro co-founded an after-school group called the Marley Girls Club.

The responding officers broke into the residence and saw Yorro Jr. carrying a knife. They demanded that he drop it, or he would be shot with a beanbag, the report says. Yorro Jr. ignored “numerous” warnings and commands from police to drop the weapon, and Officer Brian Cross fired a beanbag shotgun at Yorro Jr. four times and used a Taser on him, according to the report.

Yorro Jr. started to walk toward Cross and Burger while he was being Tased. Burger fired four rounds from his agency-issued handgun at Yorro Jr., according to the report. Yorro Jr. fell and dropped the knife, and officers handcuffed him.

“This act of advancing toward officers while holding a knife created a reason for officers to believe there was a threat of immediate serious physical injury,” the report says.

“At the moment he fired his gun, Cpl. Burger had no lesser level of force available that would have been appropriate,” state investigators added. “Seconds before Cpl. Burger fired, Mr. Yorro failed to obey numerous verbal commands to drop his knife and two types of less than lethal force … failed to subdue him.”

Police and paramedics attempted to aid Yorro Jr. while other officers entered the garage and found Valentina Yorro dead, covered with a “number of towels and blankets.” She was later determined to have died from “numerous lacerations and other injuries, including stab wounds around her head and neck.”

A police spokesperson said Friday that a homicide investigation remains ongoing into the death of Valentina Yorro, a 64-year-old mother of three and grandmother of six who volunteered at Oakwood Elementary School in Glen Burnie, working in classrooms with students with special needs.

Yorro Jr. was taken to an area hospital and declared dead. An autopsy determined he had died from three gunshot wounds, according to the report.

Shirley Yorro, one of Yorro’s daughters, previously said her brother, Yorro Jr., had long struggled with his mental health. Valentina Yorro had taken out a protective order against her son in 2020 for fear of him doing harm, citing his use of drugs, but later asked a judge to dismiss the order because her son had stayed away from her, she said during a court hearing.

The attorney general’s office released body-worn camera footage of the shooting in December.

The November police shooting was the first deadly police encounter in Anne Arundel County since a new law took effect in 2021 requiring the attorney general’s office to investigate such incidents.

Since then, the office’s Independent Investigations Division has taken on one other case from Anne Arundel. In January, county Officer J. Ricci shot and killed Dyonta Quarles Jr, who charged and punched Ricci and bit his hand as other officers attempted to handcuff the 20-year-old.

The division completed its investigation of Quarles’ death last month and forwarded it to the state’s attorney’s office on Aug. 30. A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office said it would release any findings publicly once the attorney general’s office releases its report to the public. Meanwhile, Quarles’ family has filed a wrongful death and civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Ricci and the county police department.",Q3

Kyle Matthew Movius became lost on trails in the 1,100-acre SARA Regional Park in Lake Havasu City after he was separated from a group of three other hikers, according to the Mohave County Sheriff's Department.

His body was located Saturday afternoon.

The four hikers called 911 Friday afternoon to say they were lost, out of water and showing signs of heat exhaustion in 100-degree conditions. The other hikers were a 61-year-old man and two women, ages 63 and 27.

""They were visiting SARA Park from out of town and unfamiliar with the increased danger of hiking in the heat of the day and the challenging trail system during the summer,"" the sheriff's department said in a statement.

City fire rescue crews found three hikers near a trail. Two were treated at a hospital for dehydration.

The 61-year-old man told authorities about Movius, who left the group to find the trailhead.

Authorities said Movius was found dead off of the trail system in a desert wilderness area of Lake Havasu City, which is in northwestern Arizona.",Q3
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/20/house-panel-set-advance-privacy-bill-striking-long-awaited-grand-bargain/,"House panel advances major privacy bill, striking a long-awaited grand bargain","Happy Wednesday! If you’re tracking today’s privacy markup, buckle in for a long wait. Oh, and send tips to: cristiano.lima@washpost.com. Below: Lawmakers make a new push for antitrust legislation, and Twitter notches an early win against Elon Musk. First: House panel advances major privacy bill, striking a long-awaited grand bargain For years, lawmakers have avoided making tough calls about what data privacy protections Congress should give consumers and how they should be enforced. That’s finally changing.

On Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee greenlit a watershed privacy bill that strikes compromises on a series of major issues that have long vexed negotiators.

It marks the first time a federal consumer privacy bill has made it out of committee, a historic feat.

The amended version of the bill 53-2, H.R.8152, showcases key trade-offs struck by Democrats and Republicans. Led by Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), it is the most significant attempt ever to pass a law.

Most notably, the proposal brokers a bipartisan compromise by overriding most state privacy laws, as Republicans have sought, in exchange for granting consumers a right to bring lawsuits against violators, which Democrats have called for.

The mutual concessions don’t end there. The bill includes versions of numerous Democratic asks, including civil rights protections against discriminatory uses of data, in pared-back forms more palatable to Republicans. While seen less favorably by Democratic-allied consumer advocates, they are less likely to face pushback from business groups arguing that more sweeping requirements would make compliance too burdensome.

“Everybody is coming to terms with the fact that this is going to have to be bipartisan, and nobody’s going to get everything that they want,” said Sara Collins, senior policy counsel for consumer group Public Knowledge, which backs the bill.

The latest version includes recent changes that appear directly aimed at addressing concerns of a prominent detractor.

Senate Commerce Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), whose panel controls the bill’s fate in the upper chamber, has railed against the proposal for delaying when consumers can bring lawsuits against companies by four years. The latest version reduced it to two years. There’s also an expanded section regarding forced arbitration, a key sticking point for Cantwell.

The updated measure also expressly states that California’s newly minted enforcement agency can uphold the act, a nod to criticisms from the state’s Democratic officials.

James Czerniawski, senior policy analyst at the libertarian advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, said ahead of the markup that “you could see some concerns get raised” by Republicans over expanding the private right of action and explicitly carving out a role for California’s regulators.

While some Republicans expressed reservations about that language at the session, they all voted in favor of the bill. Only two California Democrats, Reps. Anna Eshoo and Nanette Barragán, voted against it, objecting that it overrides their state law.

The bill appears to address concerns by children’s privacy advocates about a loophole that could let companies dodge scrutiny for serving targeted ads to children and teens if firms didn’t know it was happening. The updated bill only applies that more-limited standard to smaller firms. Larger companies could be held accountable if they knew or should have known about it.

The latest tweaks appear to give up ground both ways.

The latest version exempts small businesses from facing lawsuits by individuals. It also makes the Federal Trade Commission the sole enforcement agency overseeing data privacy, with a few exceptions, preempting the role of the Federal Communications Commission. Republicans have long challenged the FCC’s ability to enforce privacy rules in the telecom sector.

“The American Data Privacy and Protection Act’s national standard is stronger than any state privacy law,” McMorris Rodgers said in a statement to The Technology 202. “It prohibits Big Tech from tracking and exploiting people’s sensitive information for profit without their consent, protects kids, and ensures small businesses can innovate.”

The compromises didn’t just come “out of the blue,” though, Collins said. Discussions, negotiations and even major proposals on data privacy have existed for years.

“There has been a significant amount of education that’s been happening, and just a significant coalescing around the idea that we need to get this under control,” she said.

But this time, she said, congressional leaders made clear they were set on finishing the job.

“It came out of the gates very serious and it seems clear, especially from Palone and McMorris Rogers, that they want it to get something done … and that they were going to pressure people into getting stuff done, and that it was going to be a negotiation,” she said.

The negotiations aren’t over, however. The measure faces major hurdles in the Senate, and it remains to be seen whether House lawmakers have done enough to overcome them.

Lawmakers release more antitrust findings to bolster case for reform

The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday published its full final report on allegations of anti-competitive conduct by the tech giants, which proponents said contained more findings that strengthened calls for antitrust legislation.

According to Politico's Josh Sisco, “Internal documents from Google and Amazon … show new examples of how the companies favor their own products over competitors’ — adding ammunition to the push for Congress to toughen antitrust law.” And according to Bloomberg News's Leah Nylen, a separate memo highlighted how executives of Facebook's parent company Meta “were more worried about the threat posed by its own products” than they let on publicly.

While the panel referenced the memos when it released its report in 2020, they were released in full Tuesday. “These documents expose the problem in black and white — these platforms use their dominance to unfairly disadvantage their rivals, all at the expense of competition and consumers,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said.

The companies pushed back on the announcement. Google said the documents were “cherry-picked” and Facebook noted that the memos weren't new, while Amazon did not return a request for comment, according to reports.

Twitter notches early win in legal battle with Musk

“A Delaware Chancery Court judge largely granted Twitter’s request for an expedited trial Tuesday, an early win for the social media company in its court battle against Elon Musk, the world’s richest man,” my colleagues Elizabeth Dwoskin and Gerrit De Vynck report.

Musk's legal team had requested a trial in February, giving them seven months to try to compel information from the social network, potentially including data on the prevalence of bots on the site, which Musk has taken issue with. “Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick approved Twitter’s appeal for an early court date, setting a five-day trial in October,” my colleagues wrote.

“The reality is the delay [requested by Musk] threatens irreparable harm to the sellers and to Twitter,” McCormick said. Musk’s bid to get out of his $44 billion deal to buy the social media company is expected to be one of the most highly watched tech legal disputes in modern history.

Senate votes to advance chips bill

“A bipartisan bill subsidizing domestic semiconductor production cleared its first procedural hurdle on Tuesday in a 64-34 vote, even as the details of the legislation were still being worked out,” The Wall Street Journal's Natalie Andrews reports.

According to the report, “The vote paves the way for a larger package that would include additional funding for scientific research. Ahead of the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said he would use the result to gauge whether there was enough Republican support for the additional funding.”

“This will be a test vote, and the outcome will decide whether the science portion of USICA is included,” Schumer said.

https://www.fingerlakes1.com/2022/09/20/dec-forest-rangers-week-in-review-11/,DEC Forest Rangers: Week in review,"New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Forest Rangers respond to search and rescue incidents statewide. Working with other state agencies, local emergency response organizations, and volunteer search and rescue groups, Forest Rangers locate and extract lost, injured, or distressed people from across New York State.

In 2021, DEC Forest Rangers conducted 426 search and rescue missions, extinguished wildfires, participated in prescribed fires that served to rejuvenate hundreds of acres of land, and worked on cases that resulted in thousands of tickets or arrests.

“Over the last decade, as well as during the COVID-19 pandemic, DEC saw an increase in people visiting State lands to experience New York’s abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation,” said DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos. “DEC’s Forest Rangers continue to be on the front lines to help visitors get outside responsibly and get home safely, as well as to protect our state’s irreplaceable natural resources. Rangers’ knowledge of first aid, land navigation, and technical rescue techniques are critical to the success of their missions, which for more than a century have taken them from remote wilderness areas with rugged mountain peaks, to white water rivers, and throughout our vast forests statewide.”

I will now turn the call over to Anil for his prepared remarks. Anil?

Anil Singhal -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you all for joining us today. Let's turn to Slide No.6 for a brief recap of our non-GAAP financial results for the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023. In the first quarter, we achieved a strong top and bottom-line performance, extending our business momentum from our last fiscal year into our current fiscal year 2023.

Revenue was $208.8 million, representing a year-over-year growth of nearly 10%. Our strong revenue expansion was driven approximately by 20% product revenue growth and approximately 2% service revenue growth, both on a year-over-year basis. During the first quarter, our services revenue grew by approximately 11% while our security revenue grew by approximately 7%, both on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we grew over diluted EPS by approximately 20% year over year to deliver $0.24 per diluted share in the period.

Now let's to move Slide No.7 for some further perspective on marketing and business insights. On the security front, our new Omnis solution suite continued to gain recognition and traction in the marketplace as further expanded its offerings. For example, we recently launched the Omnis ATLAS Intelligence Feed for smarter automated DDOS attack blocking. As a new, innovative, AI-based solution, our Omnis AIF is continuously updated and enables the instantaneous blocking of a large portion of DDOS attacks, thus simplifying operations and minimizing risk for our customers businesses.

In recognition of our ongoing cybersecurity focus, we recently received the Cyber Defense Magazine Global Infosec Award and for Market Leader in Network Detection and Response, as well as the Fortress Cybersecurity Award in the Threat Detection Category. Although the total contribution from our new Omnis solution within our security portfolio remains small relative to our overall revenue, this solution suite continues to show solid potential. And we are seeing our customer's network and security teams beginning to understand the value of a shared visibility platform. Now let's turn to our customer verticals for more business insights, starting with our service provider.

Service provider revenue in the first quarter grew approximately 27% year over year, primarily driven by radio frequency propagation modeling-related revenue. We continue to see carriers invest in the 5G deployment, as evidenced by the number of radio frequency propagation modeling projects we are working on. During the first quarter, we also received additional 5G-related orders from a not -- from both Tier 1 domestic and international carriers. Moving to our enterprise customer vertical, revenue declined by approximately 5% year over year in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023.

This decline was primarily due to the timing of enterprise customer orders shipments. We remain confident in the health of this customer vertical, despite the fluctuations in the near-term. Enterprises continue to demand best-in-class cyber security solution, as well as those solutions that can help facilitate the acceleration of their digital transformation. Michael will provide more insight regarding customer orders in our verticals during his remarks.

Now let's move to Slide No.8 to review our outlook. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the market opportunity we are seeing for both our existing and new solutions from both a financial and a business perspective, we remain confident in our underlying fundamentals and positioning despite the persistence of various macro headwinds. As such, we are reiterating our non-GAAP outlook for our full fiscal year 2023. Jean will provide additional color and a recap of the numbers in her remarks.

In summary, our first quarter performance has extended our momentum into the new fiscal year while also providing us with a solid foundation going forward. Additionally, we remain encouraged by our ability to help customers address the challenges and opportunities of today's digital world effectively through our unique solutions. We look forward to sharing our progress with everyone throughout the remaining -- remainder of our fiscal year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.

Mike Szabados -- Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Anil, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 outlines the areas I will be covering today, starting with customer service wins. In our service provider customer vertical, we continue to see 5G-related activity both in domestic and international markets. For example, during the first quarter, we received mid-seven figure orders with 5G-related elements from a Tier 1 domestic carrier and an international carrier as they continue to advance their 5G network deployment.

Notably, these are follow-on orders at both carriers that placed 5G-related orders with us in the past. Now turning to our enterprise customer vertical, in the first quarter we secured a low seven-figure deal with a law enforcement agency of a large U.S. city for a combination of our service assurance and security solutions. In order to win this deal, we collaborated with the customer's network and security operations teams, who consequently judged and evaluated our solutions.

With requirements for more comprehensive insights and a scalable deep-packet inspection solution to meet visibility and security needs, the customer seems determined that our solutions are ideal, particularly when compared to a competitor solution that was unable to fulfill the customer's requirements. Our deployment for this customer utilizes the ISNG data source, our service assurance analytics provided by our nGeniusONE stack as well as the network-based detection and response capabilities of our new Omnis cyber intelligence stack. We are excited by this deal, particularly because it demonstrates how both network and security teams can leverage a scalable deep-packet inspection technology to create a shared visibility platform. And we continue to see increasing customer interest in these types of use cases.

Now our go-to-market activities. Now turning to our go-to-market activities, importantly, we have continued to prioritize attending in-person events. We find these gatherings both effective and efficient, allowing us to demonstrate our solutions and engage with existing and prospective customers. For our second fiscal quarter, we plan to attend the Black Hat conference, which takes place in Las Vegas and caters to the cybersecurity community.

We also plan to attend VMware Explore, formerly known as VMworld, which takes place in San Francisco and is focused on enterprise digital transformation as well as cybersecurity. At these events, we will demonstrate how NetScout and our customers are extending our visibility platform and underlying deep-packet inspection technology into adjacent areas ranging from cybersecurity to adaptive DDOS. We will also showcase how our solutions are incorporating our Omnis AI-Intelligence Feed, solving remote work service assurance challenges and enhancing AIOps analytics and more. As Anil mentioned, while our new cybersecurity solutions are already starting to receive recognition, our existing solutions in both security and service assurance are also changing further awareness.

For example, in June, Forrester published its Total Economic Impact study on Omnis AED. Commissioned by NetScout, this report showed an impressive ROI of 201% over three years, effectively paying black the solutions cost -- back the solutions cost in just seven months. We also were recently awarded the Digital Innovator Award in the Enterprise Digital Transformation -- in Enterprise Visionary Transformation from Intellyx, an analyst and advisory firm for our enterprise service assurance solutions. With that, I'll conclude my prepared remarks for today.

Thank you, everyone. I will now turn the call over to Jean.

Jean Bua -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will review key metrics for our first quarter fiscal year 2023 and provide some additional commentary on our fiscal year 2023 outlook. As a reminder, this review focuses on our non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated and all reconciliations with our GAAP results appear in the presentation appendix. Regardless, I will note the nature of any such comparison.

Slide No.12 details of first quarter fiscal year 2023 results. During the quarter, total revenue grew 9.7% year over year to $208.8 million, product revenue grew 19.9%, and service revenue grew 2.1%, both on a year over year basis. Our first quarter fiscal year 2023 gross profit margin was 74.5%, up 0.3 percentage points over the same quarter last year. Quarterly gross margin was impacted by the addition of approximately $15 million in radio frequency propagation modeling projects, which had an average gross margin of less than 30%.

Quarterly operating expenses increased 9.7% year over year, primarily attributable to the return to a pre-pandemic environment, including more in-person sales and marketing events, as well as increased travel costs. We reported an operating profit margin of 11.7%, compared with 11.4% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.24, compared with $0.20 in the same quarter last year, an increase of 20% year over year. Turning to Slide 13, I'd now like to review key revenue trends by customer verticals and product line.

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, on a year-over-year basis our service provider customer vertical revenue grew 26.9% while our enterprise customer vertical revenue declined 4.8%. During the quarter, our service provider customer vertical accounted for 53% of our total revenue while our enterprise customer verticals accounted for the remaining 47%. Now turning to our product lines. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, our service assurance revenue increased by 11% year over year, while our security revenue increased by 6.7% year over year.

During the first quarter, the service assurance product line represented approximately 72% of total revenue while our security product line represented the remaining 28%. Turning to Slide 14 with geographic revenue mix. In the first quarter, our revenue was more concentrated than usual in the U.S. due to increased Tier 1 domestic carrier radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue.

Also, two customers represented 10% or more of our total revenue in the quarter. Slide 15 details, our balance sheet highlights and free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $374.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term marketable securities, representing a decrease of $328.6 million since the end of fiscal year 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the two capital structure transactions we initiated in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.

The first transaction was the repayment of $150 million of debt on our revolving credit facility while the second transaction was the execution of an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock. Through the accelerated share repurchase transaction, we received 70% of the estimated program shares upfront or approximately 3.3 million shares. We anticipate receiving the remaining 30% when the program concludes no later than the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $14.9 million.

From a debt perspective, we ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 with $200 million outstanding on our $800 million revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2026. To briefly recap our other balance sheet highlights, accounts receivable net was $112.9 million, a decrease of $35.3 million since March 31, 2022. The DSO metric at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was 44 days versus 63 days at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and 64 days at the end of our fiscal year 2022. Let's move to Slide 16 for commentary on our outlook.

I will focus my review on our non-GAAP targets for fiscal year 2023. As I know noted earlier, we are reiterating a non-GAAP outlook for fiscal year 2023 that was presented during our May 15, 2022 fourth quarter and full fiscal year earnings call. As a reminder, for fiscal year 2023, we anticipate revenue in the range of $895 million to $925 million, which implies a mid to high single digit top-line growth rate. The effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 20% to 22% with the current rate at the upper end of that range.

Assuming between $73 million and $74 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the estimated impact of the $150 million accelerated share repurchase program with a partial offset to stock compensation dilution, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.97 and $2.03. I'd also like to offer some color on the second quarter as we assess the opportunities in front of us. We currently anticipate mid-single digit revenue and EPS growth rates on a year-over-year basis. That concludes my formal review of our financial results.

Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to the operator for a Q&A.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Hedberg with RBC.

Dan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey, it's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our questions. So your start to the year here, reiterating guidance for the year, nice to see. Maybe with a lot going on, could you talk to some of the confidence points you have around guidance for the year? And then on the enterprise side, could you drill down there a bit? Did you notice any changes in buying patterns, any additional scrutiny around deals there? Maybe expanding upon Anil's statement, where he called out some timing of enterprise customer order shipments?

Anil Singhal -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, Matt, overall, I mean, I know there is a lot of anxiety about recession and what's going on. So far, luckily, we are not seeing the impact on that on our pipeline or our business. Our enterprise business was very strong last year and some pull forward deals and all those. So I think this is just a timing and I think our quarterly results versus the yearly get skewered because of large deals.

So at this point, we are not seeing any impact really on -- from what is the macro headwinds. And as we see -- I mean, we still feel good about the guidance range we have provided.

Dan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Great. Thanks. Helpful. And then with security, Jean, thank you for that historical break out.

Nice to see something we were looking for. Just said -- just that said, on the seasonality here, it looks like your third quarter, the December calendar year quarter was seasonally strongest last year. Is that the type of cadence we should look for on security here or kind of that normal enterprise build through the year with the segment or is there anything else to keep in mind around enterprise seasonality for security?

Jean Bua -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. As you pointed out, Dan, the second half of our year either Q3 or Q4 is seasonally higher due to timing of the calendar year budget companies. The only thing I would say is as the year progresses and we continue to see traction in Omnis, you might be able to see a little more of an impact in Q4 than in Q3.

Dan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

OK. Great. Thank you.

Operator

Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler.

James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Jean, deferred revenue was down a bit more than normal this quarter. It looks like by about $40 million sequentially.

Was there -- was this related to product backlog or something else? In the last few quarters, you actually gave us product backlog. Can you give us that this quarter, including across I think you broke out core and radio frequency parts in the past.

Jean Bua -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So deferred revenue is a function of two things. One, as you mentioned, the use of the calibration project revenue, the radio frequency publication modeling that we started to execute on in this fiscal year as well as generally just the timing of multi-year renewal orders, where we're very heavy in Q3 and Q4 and much lighter in Q1. The product backlog as you recollect, was about $110 million at the end of last fiscal year with about $60 million of that being calibration.

So we used approximately $15 million this year -- this quarter, I'm sorry. And so of that we would have about $45 million left of calibration revenue to go through the product revenue line item. The shippable backlog, which goes to product revenue also, we shipped the $50 million at the beginning of Q1 and then we built the backlog in that area back up to about $40 million. So total backlog at the end of Q1 still sits around $85 million.

James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

OK. Great. Appreciate that and also appreciate that security versus service assurance, so I won't bug you on on that question like I normally do, Jean.

Jean Bua -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

On the radio frequency side, great quarter there, but how much longer of a tail do you guys expect the ERP business to have versus we're starting to hear some of the core service assurance deployments. And is there any way to think about how you guys are getting to kind of gross margin on the year, given the mix between RFP and the core service assurance? Thanks, guys.

Anil Singhal -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, as we move more and more toward software side, I mean, we can compensate for some of the lower gross margins on calibration and service revenue. That overall as our business grows, I mean, we see top-line growth. And of our opex line is generally similar to the previous year except for those travel expenses we talked about. We said this will be balanced out and when we give the guidance on EPS and everything.

It has used most of the calibration or all of it, I guess, Jim, to be shipped this year. So that's all built into the numbers, which we have provided for the guidance.

Jean Bua -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Just to add to that point, Jim, gross profit, you're correct, will be absorbing about $60 million of backlog at probably less than 40% margin. So I think we anticipate that our gross margin this year on a year-over-year basis will be relatively flat to potentially slightly up from the full gross profit margin of last year.

James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thanks, Anil. Thanks, Jean.

Jean Bua -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Our final question comes from Kevin Liu, K. Liu & Company. Your line is open.

Kevin Liu -- K. Liu and Company -- Analyst

Hey, good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about what the government pipeline looks for this quarter and if you would kind of expect the normal seasonal strength you tend to see?

Jean Bua -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So this quarter, as you know, the Q2 is the 930 government year. Again, we have excellent relationships with government. The good news this year is that most of the projects that we have in our Q2 forecast have been funded.

Usually we have a lot of projects and some of them are funded or not funded. I would say on a year-over-year basis, given just the state of the U.S. government at this point in purchasing and their focus, I would think that our Q2 revenue would probably be similar to the Q2 of last year and maybe up from that percentage.

Kevin Liu -- K. Liu and Company -- Analyst

Got it. And then just in terms of the second half outlook for service provider spending, it seems like many of the large Tier 1s basically at least have invested more heavily in the front half of the year. Just wondering how you guys think the second half progresses in terms of service provider mix and whether you'll continue to see more kind of work on the application modeling side or if that starts to change either to more traditional assurance or security deployments.

Anil Singhal -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I think it's going to be more -- it's going to be much less calibration and mostly service assurance orders and business in the second half. And this quarter's year-over-year growth was driven somewhat by the backlog. So we still have a lot of business in the pipeline with the service provider and I think the enterprise looks depressed. But overall, when we're at end the year will be -- it'll be in line with very similar breakdown between service provider and enterprise tomorrow.

And yeah, I think so. Basically there is -- besides calibration and traditional service assurance, there are some other things happening with -- as people are getting the 5G spectrum, which is the RAN area. So calibration is one of the bookends, very, very low margin. And then we have service assurance, which is the other bookend.

But in between we have the RAN business. So as people are getting more 5G spectrum, like everyone in -- I mean in India and other places, we see some much better business in the RAN area, which has very similar margin profile as a general service assurance business [Inaudible] last is.

Kevin Liu -- K. Liu and Company -- Analyst

Appreciate you taking the question.

Anil Singhal -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks.

https://www.metrotimes.com/news/opinion-im-a-former-republican-what-happened-to-michigans-gop-30854160,Opinion: I’m a former Republican. What happened to Michigan’s GOP?,"click to enlarge Shutterstock Michigan Republican candidate for governor Tudor Dixon speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas.

I'm having deja vu after this month's primary. Last summer, after our Republican-led state senate found no fraud in the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump said, ""The Senate ‘investigation’ of the election is a coverup."" He then called Detroit the ""most corrupt election city in the U.S.""

Since then, he has made it his mission to take revenge on our state, endorsing more than 20 candidates up and down the ballot. In return, these candidates endorse similar baseless claims about the 2020 election and other anti-democratic conspiracies.

I don't recognize our state's GOP anymore. Not too long ago, I campaigned for Rick Snyder and his non-partisan and transparent leadership. It pains me to say it, but as a lifelong conservative, I cannot support Republican candidates who are out of touch with reality.

Regardless of how you feel about Trump, these candidates are too focused on an old election to focus on delivering results. Michigan has serious problems, and we need leaders who look toward the future, not through a rearview mirror.

It's hard to know where to start with our menu of GOP candidates. At the top of the ticket for governor, Tudor Dixon wants you to think she is a moderate conservative. But don't be fooled. The real Dixon is dangerous and extreme.

Two days after receiving Trump's endorsement, Dixon wouldn't answer whether she believed the election was stolen. However, during May and July debates, she confidently said that she believed Trump won the 2020 election in Michigan and the country. In 2021, she suggested that a left-wing group was involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection and tweeted, “Steal an election then hide behind calls for unity and leftists lap it up.”

Dixon previously said she was pro-life with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the mother's life. She now claims to advocate exceptions for a mother's life but still said last month that a 14-year-old victim of incestual rape was a ""perfect example"" of prohibiting abortion.

She has taken up other far-right crusades, supporting a ""Don't Say Gay” bill, speaking at anti-vaccine rallies, waging war with drag queens, and claiming Gov. Gretchen Whitmer intentionally released COVID-19 into nursing homes. At an anti-public safety protest, Dixon said Whitmer ""has a Gestapo to come by for her,"" referencing the secret police of Nazi Germany.

Kristina Karamo is running for secretary of state. I'll admit, I don’t know everything that the secretary of state does, but, clearly, based upon her background and comments, Karamo has no business holding this office. Trump has taken an interest in this race because this office is in charge of election administration. Until last year, Karamo was an unknown poll worker who began appearing on Fox News to claim that illegal ballots were tallied at the former TCF Center in Detroit. Karamo believes Trump won the 2020 election and, this month, shared a link to a post that claimed Trump already won 2024 and will restore ""justice against the enemies of America.""

Karamo supports QAnon and other far-right conspiracies. She claimed that anyone who supports reproductive rights ""must worship Satan."" Karamo even attacked Ariana Grande for putting children ""under a satanic delusion,"" blamed Beyoncé for leading ""Black Americans into paganism,"" and called Jay-Z a ""Satanist.""

Lastly, Matt DePerno is running for attorney general. He is one of the biggest proponents of Stop the Steal, meeting with Trump on Jan. 6, appearing at Capitol rallies calling for a ""forensic audit,"" and leading the conspiracy-laden and ultimately failed litigation effort that sought to overturn Antrim County’s election. This month, DePerno was named in a criminal investigation of alleged voting machine tampering.

As attorney general, DePerno says he will prosecute women and their doctors — with no exceptions — for seeking abortions. As a lawyer, DePerno was fired from his firm for padding client billings, investigated for legal malpractice, and accused of assaulting a client.

It's time to move on from the 2020 election, but that's hard to do with candidates that all have taken up the crusade against our elections, elected officials, the rule of law, and democracy. We should all recognize that there is a cost to this craziness, and that cost is a lack of leadership that’s focused on fixing real issues. If we want responsible leadership in Lansing, then voting for candidates who are true public servants, even Democrats, is the only option.

https://news.yahoo.com/7-dead-louisville-suffers-one-150536806.html,"With 7 dead, Louisville suffers one of the deadliest weekends of 2022","In the span of just three days, shootings across the city left six dead − the second-highest number of homicides to occur within just one weekend this year − and another person died in a crash allegedly caused by an intoxicated driver. Additionally, three people were nonfatally wounded by gunfire.

These latest homicides brings the total number this year to 121, just short of the 136 homicides Louisville had experienced by this time last year. Of this year's victims, 112 were fatally shot.

These six fatal shootings in a single weekend fall just shy of the seven homicides that happened during a March weekend − the city's most violent so far this year.

""It was a very rough weekend for the community and for LMPD,"" Maj. Matt Meagher with Louisville Metro Police said Monday afternoon.

Despite the six fatal shootings, he noted both fatal and nonfatal shootings are down this year compared to last year.

No suspects have been identified, according to LMPD.

The next day, officers responded to an early morning crash on Algonquin Parkway.

Savannah Kaye Duckworth, 22, died after she was ejected from the backseat of a car after it crashed into a tree at about 2:30 a.m. Saturday. Her death is not being counted in the overall homicide count for the year.

Another passenger who was also in the backseat sustained life-threatening injuries, while the driver and front-seat passenger sustained non-life threatening injuries, according to police.

Devyn Brock, 24, was driving fast and failed to negotiate a curve before going off the road and striking the tree, according to his arrest citation. Officers detected alcohol on his breath and Brock admitted he had been drinking, the citation states. A hospital toxicology report showed his blood alcohol level was .083 − just over the legal limit of .08.

It’s not a new concept for Fortnite, but the island has taken on a Japanese feel again with the latest season: Hunters. This time, iconic characters from Japanese popular culture are set to arrive on the island throughout the chapter, while you’ll find adorable elemental sprites dotted around.

Since the battle royale game is constantly in flux, everything in this guide will change throughout the season. This also goes for the many Fortnite weapons and Fortnite NPCs across the map, and we’ll update each of these guides to reflect those changes. For now, here are the latest changes to the Fortnite map in Chapter 6, Season 1: Hunters.

The maps available in Fortnite battle royale right now are:

Jose Mario Licona and his family spent 18 hours in a refrigerated truck being smuggled to the Mexico-US border – a journey he luckily survived.

Others were less fortunate, including dozens of migrants from Mexico and Central America who were found dead Monday after being dumped in a muggy semi-truck in San Antonio, Texas. A total of 53 people died in the incident.

Licona knew only too well the dangers of entrusting one’s life to the criminal gangs that transport migrants in often overcrowded and poorly ventilated trucks.

But the smugglers – who were paid $13,000 by his relatives to take him, his wife and three children to Texas – left him no choice, he said.

“When you make a deal, the first thing you (the smugglers) ask is not to be put in a container, but during the trip they do what they want,” Licona told AFP at a shelter in the Mexican border town Ciudad Juarez.

“They often let the containers leave” with people trapped, said the 48-year-old Hondurans.

Licona, his wife and children, ages two, six and eight, traveled in a truck from Mexico City to the northeastern city of Reynosa, south of Hidalgo, Texas.

Around 100 people were traveling in the same vehicle, which was not once checked by the Mexican authorities during the more than 1,000-kilometer journey, Licona said.

From Reynosa, the family crossed the border on foot but were turned back by US authorities.

– “Criminal Enterprises” –

The smuggling networks that run the articulated lorries are becoming more sophisticated, said Dolores Paris, a migrations expert at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte.

“We are talking about criminal companies,” she told the AFP news agency.

The tractor-trailer involved in the San Antonio tragedy passed through two immigration checkpoints in Texas and had cloned license plates, according to the Mexican government.

Investigators are still trying to figure out where the vehicle began its journey.

It was the second such disaster in the city in just over five years.

In July 2017, 10 migrants were found dead in an overheated truck parked outside a Walmart supermarket.

In 2003, 19 migrants died in similar circumstances in Texas.

Licona, a shopkeeper, left Honduras in May after he was shot in the arm during a robbery.

The caravan ride was so grueling that he still regrets it today, he said.

“It was very cold. I gave my children two pants, three shirts and a quilt. You slept while driving. We brought them drinks but I didn’t want to wake them up. Thank God we’re here,” he said.

The cold made his arm ache even more, but he endured it in hopes of reaching Texas.

After crossing into Mexico, the family turned themselves in to a US border patrol in an unsuccessful attempt to gain asylum.

They are now hoping for another chance to enter the United States on humanitarian grounds.

– ‘Angel saved me’ –

Migrants staying in emergency shelters near the Mexico-US border said the journeys take up to two days, with up to 400 people crammed into a semi-truck like “animals”.

Some strip or pass out in the heat. Others avoid eating or drinking so they don’t have to urinate.

When the containers are cooled, it’s like being in a “freezer,” says one young woman.

Around 6,430 migrants have died or disappeared en route to the United States since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration.

Of those, 850 were the result of vehicle accidents or related to dangerous transport, the United Nations agency says.

In December, 56 Central American migrants bound for the United States were killed and dozens injured when the truck they were traveling in overturned in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.

A Honduran mother, who gave her name as Jenny, was aware of the risks and said she refuses to get into a truck in southeastern Mexico with her daughters, ages eight and 14.

Instead, they continued on their journey without the traffickers, despite being billed $7,500 each.

Calling for an end to U.S. funding what they term ""genocide"" in Gaza, members of the Genesee County Democratic Socialists of America conducted a protest Saturday outside of Batavia City Hall.

""A lot of people died, a lot of people are displaced,"" said Logan Cole, secretary for the group. ""It's not only that, but they can't come back, they have nowhere to go. The rates of death, especially the death of children, rival that of historical incidences of genocide, including the Armenian Genocide and even some of the concentration camps back during the Holocaust.""

Asked for his views on Hamas, Cole said, ""Their tactics are not ones I support, but it is very difficult whenever you are held in an area, in an open-air prison, and I think historically, violence has become something that is sort of inevitable when you're putting so much pressure on a particular population.""

Asked if Israel shouldn't defend itself against terrorists, Cole said, ""I disagree with the characterization of terrorists. I don't think the word terrorists has a place in the discourse. I don't think it's appropriate. It's like, you know, the difference between Hamas, which has killed thousands of people, and the IDF (Israel Defense Force), which I also don't consider terrorists, which has killed tens of thousands of people, where their violence is sanctioned by the state. To me, that's a minor point. I think that I hope for a ceasefire. I hope to end funding the atrocities being committed against Palestinians and, eventually, a free Palestine that is pluralistic and democratic.""

After the protest, Cole emailed The Batavian the text of a statement he made later in the day during the protest. Here is the full statement:

So much of the discussion surrounding the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza is designed to derail conversation about atrocities being committed against Palestinians or prevent one from being sympathetic to those in Gaza. One of the rhetorical devices that has been frequently employed in the propaganda and conversation surrounding Palestine is the thought-terminating cliché. A thought-terminating cliché is an overused piece of language that is intended to stop an argument or conversation, rather than give it the attention it deserves. For example, the word “terrorist” and the concept of terrorism are often used to try to halt discussion of Palestinian losses so people do not become sympathetic to them. At times, the Israeli media would take the figures of Palestinian casualties provided by the Gaza Health Ministry and say that all of them were terrorists — for example, Israeli news sources would say instead of 9,000 Palestinians killed (many of which were literally children), “9,000 terrorists eliminated.” As far as I’m concerned, the word “terrorist” has no place in the discourse about Palestine. Sometimes, an important problem is marginalized because it is cynically deployed as a thought-terminating cliché. Bigotry against Jewish people has been a huge problem, as we recently saw at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and the synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh and Jersey City. Lately, speaking out against the atrocities committed against Palestinians and the Zionist (right-wing, nationalist) ideas that underpin them by groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and initiatives like BDS, has been deemed by some, including the Anti-Defamation League (the ADL), as “antisemitic.” Zionism is not Judaism — indeed there are more Zionist Christians in the United States than there are Jewish people in the world. Declaring an anti-Zionist statement is antisemitic solely on that basis is itself a form of anti-Jewish bigotry because it associates the entirety of Jewish people with the modern form of Zionism, which takes much of its inspiration from atrocious ideologies like Manifest Destiny and eugenics, which themselves were used to justify other genocides. Conflating anti-Zionism and anti-Jewish bigotry through the use of the term “antisemitism” takes attention from the real acts of hate and violence being committed against Jewish people every day. The use of antisemitism as a thought-terminating cliché hurts both Jewish and Palestinian people. Ironically, perhaps the most commonly used thought-terminating cliché is the idea that the subject is complicated, complex, or that it requires nuance. Nothing ends a conversation or stops someone from asking questions faster than saying a situation is complicated. The fact that there is a genocide in Gaza is not complicated: More than 25,000 dead (more than 10,000 of them children)

More than 60,000 wounded

More than 7,000 trapped under rubble

More than 100 times as many children die everyday in Gaza than in the Ukrainian conflict zone

More than 1.9 million people have been displaced in Gaza — that’s more than 85% of the population

Only 5 doctors remain in Gaza

83 out of ~1,000 journalists in Gaza have been killed (more than 8%)

More than 7,000 Palestinian political prisoners detained

political prisoners detained More than 70% of homes have been destroyed in Gaza

95% of those facing starvation in the world are in Gaza right now It’s not complicated. We can’t stop thinking about Gaza. There needs to be a ceasefire, a halt to all US support for the military exploits against Palestine, no further Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, and a free Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.",Q3

Larry David Smith, 70, admitted to shooting Montgomery County Special Deputy Sheriff Capt. James Tappen Hall in 1971 when police detectives interviewed him in New York last Thursday, the Montgomery County Police Department said in a news release.

Smith told detectives that he accidentally shot Hall when the deputy confronted Smith as he carried property from a residential burglary to a waiting vehicle, police said in an application for an arrest warrant. Smith said he only recently learned that Hall had died and asked the detectives to apologize to the deputy’s family for the shooting, the application says.

Hall, 53, died from a gunshot wound three days after he was found lying face down in a parking lot in Rockville on Oct. 23, 1971. Investigators believe Hall was off duty and working as a security guard at a country club when he interrupted a burglary at a nearby home and confronted somebody who shot him.

Smith, also known as Larry David Becker, was interviewed by investigators in 1973. He said he knew about the deputy’s killing and would talk to them “if he could receive consideration for leniency” in unrelated charges, the warrant application says. His brother told police that he overhead Smith talking about handguns and saying that he knew who owned the gun involved in the shooting, according to the application.

But the police department’s news release says Smith wasn’t labeled a suspect in Hall’s killing back then.

Detectives from the Montgomery County Police Department’s cold case unit reopened the investigation last year around the 50th anniversary of the deadly shooting. When they reviewed a recording of Smith’s 1973 interview, they concluded that he knew details about the killing that pointed to him as a suspect instead of just an eyewitness to the shooting, the arrest warrant application says.

The police detectives determined that Becker began using the last name Smith — the last name of his birth parents — around 1975 and had been living in Little Falls, New York, for more than 45 years, police said. Little Falls, a city with roughly 5,000 residents in New York’s Herkimer County, is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of Albany.

Smith was arrested last Thursday on a first-degree murder charge. Authorities expect to bring him back to Maryland by the end of this week.

The department says Hall’s killing is the oldest cold case that it has ever solved.

Police Chief Marcus Jones said the department is “pleased to bring justice” to Hall’s family.

“This shows you the impact that we never forget,” Jones said at a news conference.

Hall’s daughter, Carolyn Hall Philo, thanked investigators for their work on the case.

“I just knew somebody was out there,” she said.",Q3
https://www.fox7austin.com/news/democratic-socialists-america-organized-labor-reproductive-justice-rally,Democratic Socialists of America holds Organized Labor for Reproductive Justice Rally,"Local chapters of Democratic Socialists of America held an Organized Labor for Reproductive Justice Rally and Resource Fair at the Federal Courthouse in Austin. They're calling for abortion rights.

The event included labor unions, activists, and abortion funds. Organizers say the resource fair brings together everyone from legal experts to unions highlighting working class voices.

""If we can just make sure that anyone who is looking for those resources or that path forward gets in touch, that will be a success for us,"" Heidi Sloan, volunteer organizer for the Austin Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America said.

She says the goal is to get people connected through collective organizing.

""We know that reproductive justice falls most unequally on people of color and poor people. When we have people of color and poor people who are already marginalized in so many ways, afraid to get the healthcare they need, we know we get deadly outcomes,"" Sloan said. ""We're also concerned about investigations into people's lives, into their privacy, into their personal information.""

One union organizer says abortion rights issues can really impact those who are working class.

""Somebody who is earning a low wage is not going to be able to afford to take care of a family... and until somebody is ready for that it should be their choice and their opportunity to plan their own family and be able to decide when that happens for them,"" Abigail Leighton, union labor organizer at IBEW Local 520, said. ""The beautiful part of having a family is that it should be full of love, and it should be fun, and it should be nice and wonderful. It shouldn't be this thing where you go, 'wow, my life is ruined.'""

Organizers say the timing of the rally comes before the Texas trigger law goes into effect on Aug. 25, which will increase penalties for abortion providers.

Mary Castle, senior policy advisor at Texas Values, says, ""it's disappointing that they're having this rally. We should be celebrating the recent Supreme Court decision on Dobbs v. Jackson that will save thousands of lives, including babies' lives in Texas. ""

Castle says there are programs that can help struggling families.

""[In addition to government programs], there are plenty of pregnancy resource centers that help women economically, whether they need to get back on their feet and get a better job to take care of their families. Of course, there's always the opportunity for our state and local government to make sure that we have adequate programs to help families succeed. At the end of the day, a baby's life should never be a sacrifice in order for a family to succeed,"" she said.",Q3

Naples Fire, with help from about a dozen other fire and mutual aid departments, closed in on the fire hours after first announcing it Sunday afternoon.

Crews planned to work at the scene into Sunday evening to address flareups.

Because of the dry conditions and limited manpower in the area, all burning permits in Naples have been suspended and none will be issued until Tuesday.

A dispatcher for the Casco Fire Department said Sunday no homes were threatened by the fire.

Jugtown Forest is owned and maintained by Hancock Land Co., which has 5,000 acres and a network of the trail system in the forest in Casco, Naples and Otisfield, according to the land company.

""This is an unbelievably horrific act,"" Sheriff Michael Bouchard said. ""It is so sad on so many levels.""

Police said Igor Lanis killed his wife, 56, and dog, and seriously injured his 25-year-old daughter, who was able to crawl away and called 911. She told dispatchers her father had just shot her but was too traumatized and distraught to tell them much more.

Bouchard credited fast-acting Walled Lake officers and deputies with saving her life.

She is now in the hospital. Her condition, after surgery, was upgraded from critical to stable condition.

Autopsies of Lanis and his wife, Bouchard said, indicate they both died from gunshot wounds, although official results are pending. The sheriff added that officials are now checking cellphones and other electronic devices belonging to Lanis to see if they hold any clues to a motive for the shootings.

A second daughter, who was not at the house, posted on social media, according to news reports, that her father ""snapped and killed my family this morning,"" blaming ""the internet"" and ""conspiracy theories,"" including one known as QAnon.

QAnon, also known as just Q, falsely claims that Donald Trump was elected to root out a secret child-sex trafficking ring run by Democratic politicians and celebrities.

""Growing up, my parents were extremely loving and happy people,"" the poster, qanonruinsfamilies on Reddit, wrote. She said she ""always had a special bond with both my parents,"" but in 2020, after former President Donald Trump lost, her ""dad started going down the Q rabbit hole.""

The Detroit News said the poster confirmed she was another daughter who was not at the house because ""she was at a friend's house for a birthday"" and blamed ""her father's mental health on his recent online interest in extremism and conspiracy theories.""

She said it ""kept getting worse and he verbally snapped at us a few times,"" but on Sunday, it turned violent after ""he had an argument with my mother"" and then suddenly used the guns in the home to fire at his wife and daughter, who was in the house.

According to the Sheriff's Office, after the 911 call, Walled Lake police and sheriff's deputies were dispatched to the Lanis residence on Glenwood Drive at 4:11 a.m. The caller, later identified as a 25-year-old daughter, told dispatchers her father had just shot her.

Bouchard said deputies and police arrived within five minutes of the call.

As they searched the area, deputies heard a gunshot and headed toward the house when Lanis burst through the front door and fired − at least twice − with a Remington 870 shotgun. Lanis hit a car that an officer was behind and a home. No one was injured from those shots.

A Walled Lake officer and a deputy returned fire, fatally shooting Lanis.

Deputies found the daughter who was shot ""trying to crawl from the home."" Her mother’s body was found during a search of the home. She had been shot multiple times in the back, and it appeared she was trying to flee out the front door.

A neighbor said the dog, which was shot to death, was a beloved samoyed named Sammy.

Thomas Develin — whom local authorities previously arrested for threatening to commit a mass shooting at a Jewish day school where he worked as a security guard — was taken into custody on Wednesday morning, the Department of Justice confirmed. He appeared in court later that day.

Over two dozen weapons were confiscated during a search of Develin’s home in March, the DOJ said, noting that he sold them for profit and also “possessed homemade conversion devices to convert semi-automatic AR-15 rifles and Glock-type pistols into fully automatic machine guns.”

The former security guard’s social media accounts were platforms for promoting hate and antisemitic violence many months before he was identified as a danger to Columbus’ Jewish community. Last September, he uploaded a photograph of Columbus Torah Academy, his employer, and captioned it, “Having an inner debate that if an active shooter comes in I might just join him.”

In March, he filmed himself holding a gun in front of the Jewish day school and posted the video on SnapChat.

Develin’s social media activity also included posts about sexually assaulting women and, the DOJ said, fantasies of “committing terrorist attacks at John Glenn International Airport and at the Budweiser manufacturing facility in Columbus,” and murdering a Morgan County officer and his “entire family.”

After his earlier arrest, a local Jewish group declared that the community was unafraid and called his posts a “cowardly act of intimidation.”

“We stand resolute against antisemitism and remain committed to safeguarding our institutions. It is our right to live peacefully as Jews and we will not cower to intimidation. Our Jewish community is here to stay and will not be silenced,” JewishColumbus said.

The Biden administration has described ghost guns as “the weapon of choice for many violent criminals.” In 2021, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF) received over 20,000 reports of their discovery at crime scenes, “a ten fold increase from 2016.”

In April, the administration issued a new rule banning the sale of unserialized “buy build shoot” kits that can be used for manufacturing ghost guns in less than an hour.

“Ghost guns are the guns everyone in this room knows that can be purchased in parts, assembled at home, no serial number, and can’t be traced. And they’re as deadly as any other weapon out there. But the fact is: they are out there,” President Joe Biden said in April at an event in New York City. “If you commit a crime [with a] ghost gun, not only are state and local prosecutors going to come after you, but expect federal charges and federal prosecution as well.”",Q3

House Republicans who insisted on a near-total ban joined with Democrats in rejecting what they saw as a more lenient Senate version of the bill.

The 95-11 vote September 27 in the House effectively stopped the measure from advancing to Gov. Henry McMaster's desk.

Now, the bill faces a near-impossible path of getting there before the November election officially kills it. Any compromise would have to be worked out by the chambers and signed by McMaster within the next six weeks.

Senate leaders say that's not happening.

Democrats claimed partial victory for temporarily blocking an outright abortion ban in the state. House Republicans are sure to try again next year, when the process would have to start all over.

""For the time being, at least, women don’t have to believe they’ll end up on the bathroom floor with a coat hanger trying to perform an abortion, and those who perform abortions don’t believe they’ll be put in jail anytime soon,"" said House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia.

""That’s what I believe we accomplished,"" he added.

The House's vote of non-support returns to senators the same ban they rejected earlier this month. A contentious, two-day debate in that chamber concluded with the Senate essentially tweaking the state's existing law; it bans abortions around the sixth week of pregnancy.

Rep. John McCravy, an ardent abortion foe, urged his colleagues not to accept a bill that largely reinforces what the Legislature passed last year.

After the U.S. Supreme Court's June decision allowed states to set abortion policy ""we came back to do a job,"" said the Greenwood Republican who drafted the House bill. ""We didn't come back to do what we'd already done.""

After the vote, he and House Majority Leader Davey Hiott insisted a compromise with the Senate is still possible.",Q3

https://digital.abcaudio.com/news/authorities-monitoring-online-threats-following-fbis-mar-lago-raid,Authorities monitoring online threats following FBI's Mar-a-Lago raid,"(NEW YORK) -- Law enforcement agencies around the country are actively monitoring online threats and rhetoric that has emerged in the wake of the FBI raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate Monday, sources tell ABC News.

Agencies are also preparing for possible acts of violence they fear could occur at or near pro-Trump demonstrations that some supporters are calling for, law enforcement sources said.

Authorities on Monday morning searched Trump's Florida estate in what sources told ABC News was part of a probe into documents that Trump improperly took to Mar-a-Lago when he departed the White House, some of which the National Archives has said were marked classified.

""Over the last several months, law enforcement officials across the nation have become increasingly concerned about calls for violence against law enforcement and other government officials by violent extremists,"" said John Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security official who is now an ABC News contributor. ""The search warrant at Mar-a-Lago has only served to increase those calls, adding to law enforcement concerns.""

In the aftermath of the raid, Trump supporters called for protests at FBI offices in Riverside, California, and Washington, D.C., according to online messages collected by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that monitors extremism and hate speech.

The ISD reported that one Trump supporter was ""calling on fellow veterans and Americans of all walks to join him"" in Washington ""to protest the out-of-control FBI and its actions against President Trump,"" while a post by another supporter implored followers to ""Protest FBI tyranny.""

Cohen says authorities have grown even more concerned as public figures have echoed those kind of remarks.

""We now face a situation where public officials and members of the media are mimicking the language used by violent extremists, and this has served to add more volatility to the situation,"" he said.

Evan worse, said Cohen, ""there's been talk about a range of conspiracy theories regarding what the FBI was doing at Mar-a-Lago. And when public figures -- especially those who have previously served in law enforcement -- spread wild conspiracy theories that they know are false, it's not only irresponsible but dangerous.""

On the other hand, Cohen said, authorities have become better at monitoring threats and acting on them.

""Following the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, law enforcement has improved its ability to analyze online activities by violent extremists, taking threats made online more seriously and incorporating that understanding into their security planning,"" he said.",Q3
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/07/06/climate-protesters-block-traffic-police-arrest-parolee-pleading-get-work/,"Climate Crazies Block Traffic, Police Arrest Pleading Parolee Instead","Police reportedly arrested a parolee in Maryland on Monday when he became agitated while pleading with a group of climate change protesters who were blocking traffic.

On July 4, climate protesters wearing yellow vests completely blocked traffic on the I-495 beltway in Montgomery County, Maryland, to demand that President Joe Biden declare a “climate emergency.” In a video that has since gone viral, a man claiming to be a parolee exited a vehicle and pleaded with the protesters to let him pass, alleging that he would be sent back to prison if he was late for his job.

“One lane, I am asking one lane,” the man desperately pleaded as the activists refused to budge.

The man then began tearing signs from the protesters’ hands as they persisted in blocking traffic. Take a look:

Another video shared by documentarian Ford Fischer later showed police arresting the man after he became “agitated at the activists blocking traffic” and “got more physical,” according to Fischer. Police arrested the parolee first and reportedly “took their time” arresting the protesters.

Fox 4 DC reported that 13 climate protesters were all arrested for charges related to “resisting arrest, disturbing peace/hinder passage, and failure to obey a reasonable/lawful order.” The man, presumably identified as a “counter-protester,” was also reportedly “charged with second-degree assault and resisting arrest.” One of the alleged protesters, Guido Reichstadter, came to the man’s defense on Twitter, saying he never felt threatened and that he would gladly “issue a statement or testify in his favor.”

“The shirtless man nudging me with his body was not violent with me and I did not feel threatened. I believe his arrest was unnecessary and I’ll be happy to issue a statement or testify in his favor. The lives of 1000’s of millions of people depend on emergency climate action now,” said Reichstadter in a now-deleted tweet.

DALLAS (WBAP/KLIF) — Children’s Medical Center Foundation, the fundraising arm of Children’s Health, announced a $500,000 donation from the Jordan Spieth Family Foundation on Wednesday to support the expansion at Children’s Medical Center Plano, with a focus on pediatric oncology.

“Annie and I are very grateful to the incredible oncology staff at Children’s Health for their life-saving work. We have a personal connection to pediatric cancer, and to this hospital specifically,” Jordan Spieth shared. “And while we hope research continues to make this issue nonexistent in the future, for now, our focus is on improving each family’s experience as much as possible.”

In recognition of the gift, the family support lounge, that will be located in the newly expanded Pauline Allen Gill Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children’s Medical Center Plano, will be named the Jordan Spieth Family Foundation Lounge. The new space will provide respite for patient families with a lounge area and an enclosed kitchenette designed for families to gather in a calm and welcoming environment.

“Within each of our pillars, we want to focus on providing direct support to children and families who are facing challenges,” Annie Spieth said. “Our goal with this gift is to provide thousands of families in North Texas who are facing a diagnosis closer access to the life-saving care of Children’s Medical Center. If we can be a small part of expanding access to treatment and, in turn, give quality time back to these families, then we hopefully contribute toward their healing journey. Jordan and I are very grateful to the incredible oncology staff at Children’s for their life-saving work.”

“Jordan and Annie Spieth have been longtime supporters of the Children’s Health mission, which they understand deeply. We’re extremely grateful for this generous gift as the Plano campus of Children’s Health expands to meet the growing population of kids in North Texas. Having access to the best pediatric care for children and families close to home is critical,” said Brent Christopher, president of Children’s Medical Center Foundation. “This commitment to help kids battling cancer is at the heart of what it means to make life better for children.”

Groundbreaking for the Children’s Medical Center Plano campus expansion took place in October 2021 and is expected to be complete by late 2024. Expansion plans for the Plano campus include a new 395,000-square-foot tower to house expanded specialty care programs, such as cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, and neurology, among others.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368456/pml-q-all-set-to-remove-shujaat-as-party-chief,PML-Q all set to remove Shujaat as party chief,"The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) decided on Thursday to remove party President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and General Secretary Tariq Bashir Cheema and hold fresh election for the top posts within 10 days, senior party leader Senator Kamil Ali Agha said.

The decisions were taken in an emergent meeting of the PML-Q Central Working Committee (CWC), chaired by Senator Agha. The meeting also formed a five-member election commission, headed by Jahangir A Joja, for the intra-party elections.

Addressing news conference after the meeting, Agha said that CWC met after receiving requisition for holding an emergent meeting. He added that a total of 83 members participated in the meeting in which four to five resolutions were passed.

The CWC met a week after Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari rejected the 10 PML-Q lawmakers’ votes in favour of party leader Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi in the election for the chief minister on the basis of a letter from Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain.

The deputy speaker ruled that the letter had stated that Shujaat, as the PML-Q president, had barred his party’s lawmakers from voting for Elahi. He then declared Elahi’s rival, Hamza Shehbaz, as the Punjab chief minister.

Elahi, however, moved the Supreme Court, challenging the deputy speaker’s ruling. On Tuesday, a three-member bench of the apex court struck down Mazari’s ruling and declared Elahi as the winner in the election for Punjab chief ministership.

When asked at the news conference, Agha said that it was not about the letter. He expressed his surprise that someone brought Shujaat to the Supreme Court “which is unbelievable”. He added that “actions of three gentlemen” proved very harmful for the party.

“The CWC has unanimously decided to remove Chaudhry Shujjat Hussain from the party’s president position because his health condition has badly affected his decision power,” Senator Agha told reporters.

“The CWC has also decided to remove Tariq Bashir Cheema for using the party for his vested interests and hatching conspiracies,” he added. “The CWC also passed a resolution, recognising the services of Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi for the party.”

Agha said he had long-standing relationship with Shujaat but his recent decisions were “very painful” for the veteran members of the party. “All members of the PML-Q have great respect for Chaudhry Shujjat Hussain but we are unable to understand what has happened,” he said.

“I have underscored on numerous occasions that there were no differences between the Chaudhry brothers – Shujaat and Elahi – but very unfortunate thing has happened, which is beyond imagination,” he said, adding that “it is very unpleasant situation”.

Agha announced that immediate elections would be held in the party and a five-member election commission had been appointed. As per the party’s constitution, Agha added, a meeting of the Central General Council could also be called.

The CWC also passed resolution to support the Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) Muhammad Sabtain Khan in the election for the post of Punjab Assembly speaker – the seat vacated by Elahi following his election as the chief minister. The CWC directed its members to vote for Khan.",Q3
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/abortion-laws-force-clinics-move-maintain-access-rcna42522,"From down the street to 1,000 miles, abortion clinics are moving to protect access","BRISTOL, Tenn. and BRISTOL, Va. — The community of Bristol is proud to straddle the border between two states.

Tennessee flags fly on the south side of State Street, Virginia flags on the north. A series of plaques down the middle of the main downtown thoroughfare mark the twin cities’ divide. A large sign at the end of town reminds everyone they’re right on the state line.

After the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which gave regulation of abortion back to states, such borders make all the difference in what care is available. In Tennessee, most abortions will soon be illegal. In Virginia, they won’t be.

For staff members at Bristol Regional Women’s Center, an OB-GYN practice that offers abortions in Bristol, Tennessee, the proximity to Virginia created an opportunity. They could ensure access by helping open a clinic on the other side of the state line in Bristol, Virginia.

A large sign extols the community of Bristol’s footprint in two states ― Tennessee and Virginia. Each city regulates abortion very differently, and that’s created a unique chance for a new clinic to open its doors and keep serving patients. Sam Whitehead / KHN

“Why did we choose Virginia?” asked Diane Derzis, who owns the clinic, which opened in July about a mile across town. “It just made sense.”

Clinics across the country are still adjusting to the new legal landscape created by Dobbs. Some have shut down completely. Others have scaled back the services they offer. Still others have relocated hundreds of miles away.

A federal appeals court allowed Tennessee’s six-week abortion ban to take effect, and a near-total ban is set to begin in late August. Meanwhile, Virginia still allows most abortions through the second trimester.

The adjoining towns govern independently and are subject to different state laws, said Anthony Farnum, mayor of Bristol, Virginia. The covid-19 pandemic, he said, provided a good example. “It was interesting,” Farnum said as he sat outside the Burger Bar, a diner just a stone’s throw from the state line. “The bars on the Virginia side closed at 10 p.m., and masks were required. The bars were open to 2 a.m. on the Tennessee side, no masks required.”

Also, each state handles sales and income taxes differently, Farnum said. And his city is home to Virginia’s first casino, something that can’t be found in Tennessee. What’s happening with abortion is just the latest example.

Derzis said a doctor at the Bristol Regional Women’s Center reached out to her with the idea for the Virginia clinic. Derzis owned Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Mississippi clinic at the heart of the Dobbs case. She said she’s working to offer abortions to people across the Southeast who have lost access as states restrict the procedure. She opened Las Cruces Women’s Health Organization in southern New Mexico in late July after closing her clinic more than 1,000 miles away in Jackson, Mississippi.

“It’s like a game of dominoes. It’s just a huge swath of states not offering the service any longer,” Derzis said. “So those women have to go north or west.”

Derzis opened the clinic in Bristol, Virginia — registered with the state as Bristol Women’s Health — in late July and said she’s already had a few patients. Derzis said the Tennessee and Virginia clinics are separate, distinct operations.

Moving a medical practice across state lines presents several costly logistical challenges.

Deborah Jo Adams, who works at Bristol Regional Women’s Center, has raised more than $100,000 for the new clinic through an online fundraiser. The money will help cover “extra legal fees, new certifications, licenses, and regulations to practice in Virginia, a raise in prices of certain medical equipment, and unexpected building repairs,” she wrote on the fundraiser page.

In the past, Dr. Howard Herrell, an OB-GYN in Greeneville, Tennessee, referred women to clinics in the Tennessee cities of Bristol and Knoxville and in the North Carolina city of Asheville — all about the same distance from his practice.

But even those clinics — at least an hour away by car — are not guaranteed to be there forever, he said. In recent months, both clinics in Knoxville that offered abortion services have closed, one of them after an act of arson, and the future of clinics in nearby states is uncertain.

“All of that is dependent upon what might happen with laws over time in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia,” said Herrell, the incoming chair of the Tennessee chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Bristol Regional Women’s Center, the Tennessee clinic, sits along a busy, four-lane highway that rumbles with heavy truck traffic. But that doesn’t stop protesters from gathering outside on the few days a week the clinic provides abortions.

On a recent weekday morning, a handful stood on the sidewalks around the clinic holding large anti-abortion signs. On the clinic property, a group of volunteers who call themselves the Pink Defenders had put up pro-abortion rights signs and hung large sheets in various shades of pink and purple around the clinic parking lot. They’re here regularly, in an effort to keep patients from being bothered by anti-abortion protesters.

“Honk twice for choice,” read one of the signs, which faced oncoming vehicles. Pink Defenders cheered when drivers obliged.

Erika Schanzenbach, who opposes abortion and whose longtime protests outside the Tennessee clinic have led to civil lawsuits, said she heard about the Virginia clinic from the online fundraiser. This summer, she distributed flyers in the neighborhood around the new clinic encouraging locals to call city officials and the property owner to complain.

“As we were informing people about this clinic coming to their neighborhood, there were quite a few people that didn’t know,” Schanzenbach said. “A lot of people don’t want it in their neighborhood.” She said she plans to protest there, too.

Farnum, the Virginia mayor, said he received dozens of calls and emails — “a lot for a city this size” — from residents concerned about the clinic. But he told them he can’t do much to stop it. “It’s really more of a state decision. And currently, right now, the state law is that it is legal to operate that in the state,” Farnum said. “Our hands are sort of tied. We don’t really have anything to vote on.”

For now, there’s not much activity at the Virginia clinic. The low-slung brick building sits at the end of a residential street. On a recent weekday morning, a small pile of empty boxes, formerly full of new office supplies, sat outside. While Pink Defenders and protesters gathered at the Tennessee clinic about a mile away, the Virginia one sat quiet, empty.

To Max Carwile, it’s a symbol of resilience. She’s the director of programs at Abortion Access Front, a national abortion rights group, and a co-founder of Mountain Access Brigade, an abortion fund that works in East Tennessee.

She grew up in the region, which she called a “desert of health care access,” and said the clinic opening in Bristol, Virginia, will mean a “world of difference to patients” — even if the people running it can’t keep the doors open forever.

“For the ones who have the chance to move a short distance, that’s amazing,” said Lori Williams, chair of the National Abortion Federation’s board of directors. “For the ones that are able to move great distances, that’s also amazing. But there’s many of us who won’t be able to make that move.”",Q3
https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2022/08/31/683287.htm,California Oks Bill Protecting Workers Who Use Marijuana at Home,"California could soon become the seventh state to make sure people won’t lose their jobs if they smoke marijuana when they’re off the clock.

State lawmakers this week passed a bill that would stop companies from punishing workers who fail a certain type of drug test that detects not whether a person is high, but whether the person has used marijuana at all in recent days.

These tests, which rely on urine or hair samples, look for a substance that the body makes when it breaks down THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. But that substance, called metabolites, can remain in a person’s body for weeks after using marijuana, according to the Mayo Clinic, meaning people can fail a drug test even though they are not impaired.

The legislation would prevent workers from being punished from failing these types of drug tests. Companies could still punish employees for failing other types of tests that use saliva and are better at determining if a person is currently high.

The bill now goes to the desk of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has until the end of September to decide whether to sign it into law. It would take effect on Jan. 1, 2024.

“Nothing in this bill would allow someone to come (to work) high,” said Assemblymember Bill Quirk, a Democrat from Hayward and the author of the bill.

California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996, and it was one of the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2016. But the state has been slow to pass laws protecting workers who use marijuana on their own time.

Six other states – Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Montana and Rhode Island – have laws protecting workers’ rights to use recreational marijuana, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Twenty-one states have laws protecting workers who use medical marijuana from discrimination.

Labor unions argue it isn’t fair to punish employees for doing something that is legal outside of their job and doesn’t interfere with their responsibilities at work.

“Using outdated cannabis tests only causes employees to feel unsafe and harassed at work, it does not increase workplace safety,” said Matt Bell, secretary-treasurer for the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 324.

The bill includes a number of exceptions to protect employers. It does not apply to companies that must perform drug testing to receive federal funding or comply with federal contracts. It also doesn’t apply to anyone working in the building and construction trades, an industry that benefits from lots of federal funding.

Still, the California Chamber of Commerce opposed the legislation because it would “create a protected status for marijuana use” in state law that bans discrimination in the workplace.

“Put simply: marijuana use is not the same as protecting workers against discrimination based on race or national origin,” the chamber wrote in a letter to lawmakers.

https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/south-dakota/new-player-shifts-dynamic-in-slaughterhouse-debate-in-sioux-falls,New player shifts dynamic in slaughterhouse debate in Sioux Falls,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — A new group joined the debate over animal processing plants in Sioux Falls this week, potentially changing the financial dynamics of the citywide election in November.

Sioux Falls Open for Business filed paperwork with the city clerk’s office on Tuesday, Sept. 20, creating a ballot question committee. The group represents a collection of agriculture and business interests from Sioux Falls and the region, several of which have already stated their opposition to a proposed ban on new slaughterhouses in the city.

The significance of the filing isn’t the individual members’ opposition to the ban, rather their ability to spend money in support of that position.

Christine Erickson, president of the South Dakota Trucking Association and chairperson of Sioux Falls Open for Business Contributed

“We have a campaign and marketing strategy to get the truth out about what this vote really is and why it's important to have locally sourced food in South Dakota,” said Christine Erickson, a former city councilor who is chairperson for Sioux Falls Open for Business.

That puts the Open for Business committee on equal status with Smart Growth Sioux Falls, the group backing the ban, which reported raising nearly $100,000 as of Aug. 31.

Erickson declined to estimate how much money the group may commit to the campaign. The new organization is a “grassroots” effort to share what the vote means for the city and implications of a potential ban, she said.

While that means they will be spreading out to communicate with civic and service organizations, and other retail campaign activities, they also know it will take money, Erickson said.

“We recognize that it will take resources to get our message out to the voters and we are prepared to get that message out,” she said.

The committee has hired Lawrence & Schiller, a prominent Sioux Falls advertising and marketing firm with a long history of political work in the state.

The ballot question was spurred by the plans by Wholestone Farms to build a pork plant in northeast Sioux Falls that could process up to 6 million pigs per year. Those plans have been in the works for about 5 years and were largely under the public’s radar.

RECENT WHOLESTONE FARMS NEWS:







Last summer Citizens for a Sustainable Sioux Falls gathered 10,000 signatures asking voters to ban future slaughterhouses within city limits. The city vote will be held in conjunction with the broader midterm elections on Nov. 8.

Smart Growth Sioux Falls is the ballot committee created in support of that ban. Another slaughterhouse no longer fits the kind of economic development the city wants or needs, they contend. They point to the accompanying traffic, odor and threats to water quality.

Robert Peterson, treasurer for Smart Growth Sioux Falls, which opposes new slaughterhouses in Sioux Falls. Contributed

“Protecting our homes, businesses, and natural resources from the harmful effects these mega-slaughterhouses are known to bring is vital to a strong economic future for Sioux Falls,” said Robert Peterson, treasurer for the group. “Do we want to continue to grow as a regional hub for technology, education, and recreation? Or do we want to become 'Slaughterhouse Falls'? That is what voters will decide in November.”

Smart Growth is financially supported by biofuels producer POET, which has corporate offices about a mile northwest of the Wholestone site, as well as a handful of other organizations.

POET founder and CEO Jeff Broin also owns a home and gated housing development about a mile southeast of the site.

The question of animal processing in the city limits puts POET in conflict with agriculture and commodity groups who see the Wholestone plant as an additional market for their products.

ADVERTISEMENT

It’s a sub point, though an important one, in the overall discussion, Erickson said.

“It’s unfortunate that someone who has made a fortune in the agriculture industry is now opposed to a project just because it's near his large home,” she said.

Erickson left the Sioux Falls City Council in June after serving the maximum two terms. She is the president of the South Dakota Trucking Association, one of the 16 organizations backing Open for Business.

Wholestone has done everything the right way in planning the plant, she said, only to face a “last ditch” effort on the ballot.

“What this says is, ‘Hey, come to South Dakota, we’re open for business, but only if we like your industry.’ That’s not how we do business in South Dakota.”

Gov. Kristi Noem recently expressed a similar concern, saying the idea of an initiated measure is a detriment to attracting new business to the state.

Smithfield Foods operates a plant near downtown Sioux Falls that first started slaughtering operations in 1911. Today that expanded plant processes about 18 million pigs per year.

ADVERTISEMENT

It’s that image of an aging plant, with a history of odor and water quality violations, that Wholestone backers are fighting against. The new plant, they say, will use the latest technology for odor mitigation and includes a stand-alone wastewater treatment plant.

Still, the legacy of the Smithfield plant is pervasive in any discussion about Wholestone.

“We know we have an uphill battle,” Erickson said. “We are confident in getting a positive message out, and the truth out, to voters in Sioux Falls.”",Q3

Securing India’s borders against interests antagonistic to the nation and at the same time putting in place systems that can prohibit such elements while encouraging genuine trade and commerce are the principles of effective border management. Several initiatives have been undertaken by the Department of Border Management of India to secure our borders and create critical infrastructures. These include the construction of fences, floodlighting, roads, Border Out Posts (BOPs), Company Operating Bases (COBs) and deploying technological solutions along the Indian borders. India shares its borders with the following countries:

Bangladesh 4096.70 km running along West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.

Pakistan has a border stretch of 3323 km running along Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh.

China has a 3488 km border running along Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Ladakh.

Nepal has a 1751 km border running along Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim.

Bhutan has a 699 km border running along Sikkim, West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

Myanmar has a 1643 km border running along Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram.

Afghanistan has a 106 km border running along the Union Territory of Ladakh but is presently under the illegal occupation of Pakistan

While addressing the closing session of the two-day National Security Strategies (NSS) Conference, Union Home Minister Amit Shah stressed checking the demographic change in border areas and maintaining strict vigilance. This conference was attended by the Union Home Secretary, DGPs of all states and UTs, Deputy NSAs and Chiefs of Central Armed Police Forces. Various topics related to security were discussed and deliberated upon, and one of these topics was demographic changes and growing radicalisation in border areas. He said that the demography in border areas of the country is changing, and police forces of the border states should keep a watchful eye on this development, which is very serious in nature.

Presently, we are facing the threats of illegal migrants from Myanmar, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and other countries. The protraction of illegal immigrants into India and their continued stay in India has grave national security implications. In 2004, then Union Minister of State for Home told Parliament that the country had 1.2 crores of unlawful migrants. Presently, India is home to over two crore illegal migrants. Following are the factors which facilitate illegal migration.

Porous Borders : India has a long and porous international border with Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Myanmar. The border passes through various natural and cultural landscapes.

Ethnicity : The ethnic configuration of the people is similar on both sides of the borders, and it is quite challenging to discern between the Indian residents and others.

Fertile Land : The flat and fertile land along the borders support dense human inhabitation along the border. There are many habitats situated right up to the borders.

Social network : The social networks created between the old and new immigrants over decades are incredibly necessary for the movement of people stealthily across the border.

Political patronage : Political parties have always utilised the susceptibility of the illegal migrants for their selfish interests and paybacks. For vote banks, the political parties sometimes protect the illegal migrants.

Impact of Illegal Migration in India. Such a massive influx of illegal migrants has grave consequences on the nation’s socio-cultural, economic and political aspects.

Frequent clashes due to lack of security : Illicit migration has caused periodic clashes between India’s residents and migrants. This leads to their loss of life and property, thus violating their fundamental constitutional rights.

Political Instability : Fight for the ownership of limited resources, economic opportunities, and cultural dominance leads to conflict between the locals and migrants. Local political leaders exploit the conflict for their political games, thus great a great divide among the people.

Law and Order problem : The inimical elements undermine the rule of law and integrity of the country and indulge in illegal and anti-national activities, such as entering the country clandestinely, fraudulently acquiring identity cards, exercising voting rights in India and resorting to trans-border smuggling and other crimes.

Radicalisation and terrorism : Fight against terrorism in India is sometimes viewed as an attack on Muslims, which is not true. But the ill migrants use this news to radicalise certain vulnerable sections of the Muslim community staying in border areas. This is the significant impact of illegal migration.

For the last two decades or so, the general belief among counter-terrorism experts is that radicalisation broadly evolves in a process that ultimately leads to involvement in terrorism. Radicalisation can be defined as a road to terrorism, a trap of fundamentalism and extremism, and a path where violence is justified as a means to achieve the results. Border regions of India are becoming nearly impossible for the Border Security Forces (BSF) to manage. As per the reports of Uttar Pradesh and Assam police forces, there has been a 32% increase in the Muslim population in some border districts compared to the national average of 10-15%. They also reported that illegal camps comprising illegal migrants are cropping up in many border districts. It is also seen that these states have seen a mushrooming of religious institutions and structures. In addition to these, two states where the situation of illegal migrants is grim are Uttarakhand and Rajasthan. Unfortunately, this has to lead the exodus of the non-Muslim population, who couldn’t withstand the sponsored violence and militant activities.

The planned demographic changes in Indian border states with complex insiders’ logistic and moral support offer fertile grounds for terrorism and a sure way to destroy Indian cultural identity. The growth of illegal migrants is closely connected with national security, especially in the border areas. They bring religious, ethnic and linguistic conflicts leading to terrorism.

To plan and accomplish a terrorist attack, the terror organisations require foot soldiers, supporters & sympathisers, funds, arms and war-like stores, unrestricted mobility, and other logistics support to reach the targets. Therefore, an efficient counter-terrorism strategy should be multi-dimensional. Counter-radicalisation and de-radicalisation should form the fundamental pillars of the overall national security strategy because the radicalisation process prepares the ideological, social, cultural, and religious basis for using terror as a weapon by these terrorist organisations. All the above factors need a fertile ground and a radicalised section of the society to provide that much-needed platform.

Since the Indian subcontinent was divided based on the two-nations theory, it was imperative that right after the independence, the Indian intelligence should have established an apparatus to monitor the rise of inimical forces responsible for dividing the Indian society. But our intelligence agencies lacked a futuristic outlook in mapping and analysing the risks and threats posed to India. Thus, the first step to counter-radicalisation is to diagnose the problem correctly and holistically and then build a counter-narrative. At the same time, ensuring adequate border security and management is essential for preventing and countering the flow of suspected people in the border areas is equally important.

The problem of radicalisation and terrorism in India cannot be tackled without understanding the phenomenon of terrorism in South Asia. Therefore our policy of counter radicalisation must co-ordinated as South-Asian efforts to address the challenges of radicalisation.

Eighteen killed in Enga

At least 18 people have been killed in Enga Province, which Prime Minister James Marape yesterday placed under “emergency status.” Local police chief George Kakas said that 13 men and five women were killed near the mining town of Porgera on Tuesday, with the victims apparently hacked to death with machetes and axes. The jungles of the region regularly see violent clashes — sometimes leading to mass killings — between local tribes, sparked by conflicts over land, resources or other disputes. Tuesday’s violence was not believed to be linked to the country’s election campaign, Marape said. “We have called our additional manpower from both military and police not just for Porgera, but other areas that need special assistance,” he said.

Bodies found after ferry sank

At least nine bodies have been found after a ferry sank due to bad weather, a search-and-rescue official said yesterday. The KM Cahaya Arafah capsized off Ternate on Monday evening, prompting a search-and-rescue operation for 13 missing people. Rescuers found four bodies on Wednesday evening and five bodies on the fourth day of the search, the Ternate search-and-rescue agency said in a statement. Four people remain missing. The boat was carrying 77 passengers and crew on board as it traveled to nearby Halmahera. Local villagers had sailed out in their longboats to help authorities with the search operation.

Rights advocate set on fire

A disability rights advocate has died after she was set on fire in Jalisco state, the local prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday. The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities. Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a news conference, citing witnesses. Padilla, who had burns on 90 percent of her body, died on Tuesday from the “seriousness of the injuries,” he said. She had been living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor, after she had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor’s behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son’s health. The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, prosecutors said.

Logo draws Nazi comparison

The rollout of a new logo for an Atlanta, Georgia, area elementary school has been paused after parents pointed out similarities to a Nazi symbol, although the Cobb County School District said the design was based on an army colonel’s eagle wings. The school district on Tuesday said that it has halted distribution of the new logo for East Side Elementary School in Marietta after it drew condemnation on social media. The logo depicts an eagle, the school’s mascot, over the school’s initials “ES.” The Nazi eagle, which was developed in the 1920s and later became a symbol for white supremacists, depicts an eagle holding a swastika in its talons. “Really it’s a big oversight of the county and everyone involved in the process who reviewed that, to not call out the fact that this looks like Nazi iconography,” Mike Albuquerque, the father of two students who are to attend the school next year, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Amendments to Chicago Ordinance Impose Additional Obligations Relating to the Prevention of Sexual Harassment

As of July 1, 2022, amendments to the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance went into effect, requiring employers with at least one employee working within the city's boundaries to update sexual harassment policies; display new posters; and augment their sexual harassment training. Employers who fail to comply could face fines of up to $10,000 per day.

Employers' sexual harassment policies must now track the City of Chicago's model policy, which, among other requirements, includes a statement that sexual harassment is illegal in Chicago and provides a definition and examples of prohibited conduct that constitutes sexual harassment. The Chicago Commission on Human Rights provides a City of Chicago Sexual Harassment Model Policy as well as a Sexual Harassment Model Poster.

All employers with at least one employee working within the city of Chicago's boundaries also must provide a Sexual Harassment Prevention Training and a Bystander Intervention Training. Supervisors and managers must complete two hours of the Sexual Harassment Prevention Training annually, while all other employees must complete one hour of such training annually. All employees must complete one hour of the Bystander Intervention Training annually.

Supervisors/managers not located in Chicago but who supervise/manage employees in Chicago must also complete the newly required training.

Employers must retain written records to show compliance with the Ordinance, including records of the policies and training provided to employees for five years. The statute of limitations for violations of the Ordinance has increased from 300 days to 365 days.

Benesch attorneys are ready to assist with compliance with the amended Ordinance.

Recent Amendments to the Illinois Equal Pay Act: Under recent amendments to the Illinois Equal Pay Act (IEPA), employers with at least 100 employees in Illinois, that were authorized to do business in Illinois as of March 23, 2021, must apply for an Equal Pay Registration Certificate by March 23, 2024. Employers authorized to do business in Illinois after March 23, 2021 must apply within three years of commencing business operations, but not before January 1, 2024. The Illinois Department of Labor will assign employers a specific deadline to apply.

In the application for an Equal Pay Registration Certificate, employers must provide a list of all employees employed during the past calendar year. The list must: 1) separate the employees by gender, race, and ethnicity as reported in the employer's most recently-filed EEO-1; 2) include the start dates for each employee; 3) include the county in which each employee works; 4) include “any other information the Illinois Department of Labor deems necessary to determine if pay equity exists among employees”; and 5) report the total wages paid to each employee over the past calendar year, rounded to the nearest $100. The Illinois Department of Labor has provided a template spreadsheet, which indicates what information should be reported in the list of employees.

In addition to the list of employees, employers must also provide a certification statement. The Illinois Department of Labor has provided a template certification statement, which includes all required information as well as blank spaces for employers to complete with information specific to them.

Employers are not exempted from compliance if the Illinois Department of Labor fails to provide a deadline. Employers should contact the Illinois Department of Labor if they do not receive a deadline but believe they should have received one. If an employer has not incurred any penalties for violating the Illinois Equal Pay Act's reporting/certification requirements, the employer is entitled to 30 calendar days to submit an application/recertification if they failed to do so initially.

Employers would be wise to gather employee information and conduct pay audits in order to prepare for assembling their applications. The Illinois Department of Labor has posted a list of Frequently Asked Questions, as well as helpful PowerPoint slides, to its website.

Amendments to the One Day Rest in Seven Act: Governor Pritzker signed SB 3146 into law on May 13, 2022, amending ODRISA in four distinct ways, which go into effect January 1, 2023:

Seven-Day Period vs. Calendar Week. First, the amendments to ODRISA provide a new definition of the period covered by the Act. The new amendment replaces the term “calendar week” with “seven-day period.” Thus, starting January 1, 2023, ODRISA will apply to any employee who works six consecutive days regardless of where those days fall on the standard Sunday to Saturday workweek.

Additional Meal Period for Shifts of at Least 12 Hours. Next, the amendments will require an additional meal period for employees when their shifts are 12 or more hours. Starting January 1, 2023, employers will have to provide an additional 20-minute meal period for every 4.5 hours worked beyond the initial 7.5 hours. If an employee works 12 consecutive hours, they are entitled to two 20-minute meal breaks. The amendment also clarifies that meal breaks do not include “reasonable time spent using the restroom facilities.”

New Notice Requirements. The amendments will require that employers conspicuously post a notice that summarizes ODRISA requirements and provides information as to how an employee may file a complaint. For remote employees or employees who frequently travel, employers must provide the notice via email or on a website that the employees regularly use to communicate work-related information. The Illinois Department of Labor will make this notice available on its website before January 1, 2023.

New Penalties for Noncompliance. Starting January 1, 2023, employers with fewer than 25 employees may be fined $250 in penalties, payable to the Illinois Department of Labor, as well as $250 in damages, payable to the affected employee(s), per offense. Employers with twenty-five or more employees may be fined $500 in penalties, payable to the Illinois Department of Labor, as well as $500 in damages, payable to the affected employee(s), per offense.

Illinois employers should review and, where applicable, revise employee work schedules to ensure that they comply with the Act's amendments.

Creation of the Family Bereavement Act: Governor Pritzker signed SB 3120 into law on June 9, 2022. Also known as the Family Bereavement Leave Act, this Act amends the Child Bereavement Leave Act and will go into effect on January 1, 2023. As with the Child Bereavement Leave Act, the Family Bereavement Leave Act tracks the eligibility requirements in the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”). To be eligible for leave under the Family Bereavement Leave Act, and employee must have: 1) been employed by the employer for at least one year; 2) worked at least 1,250 hours for the employer during the prior 12-month period; and 3) worked at a worksite with at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.

The Family Bereavement Leave Act requires that covered employers provide up to 10 workdays of unpaid leave to eligible employees who are absent due to any of the following: a miscarriage; an unsuccessful intrauterine insemination or assisted reproductive technology procedure; a failed adoption; an adoption match that is not finalized because it was contested; a failed surrogacy agreement; a diagnosis that negatively impacts pregnancy or fertility; or a stillbirth.

The Family Bereavement Leave Act will also require employers to provide 10 workdays of unpaid leave for employees attending the funeral of, grieving the death of, or making arrangements due to the death of a “covered family member.” Under the Act, “covered family member” includes children, stepchildren, spouses, domestic partners, siblings, parents, parents-in-law, grandchildren, grandparents, or stepparents.

Illinois employers should review and, where applicable, revise policies to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Family Bereavement Leave Act.

Club 77, a nightclub located in Sydney’s Darlinghurst neighborhood, posted on its website that it is considered ""harassment"" to stare at someone without their consent and that law enforcement may be called if patrons engage in that behavior, The New York Post reported.

""We operate a zero-tolerance policy on harassment of any kind,"" the club’s website says. ""Club 77 is not a place to come to if your sole purpose is to ‘pick up’. If you do come in and are approaching multiple people or giving unwanted attention to someone, you are going to attract the attention of our security, who have been instructed to stop this kind of behaviour.""

The warning continues, ""As a nightclub, we encourage you to interact with strangers, however any engagement MUST begin with verbal consent. This also applies if you are, for example, staring at someone from afar. If the attention you are giving someone is unwanted, that is considered harassment.""

The website states that a designated ""Safety Officer"" wearing a pink vest will be tasked with handling complaints and concerns related to the new policy and ""offending individuals"" will be removed from the club.

Club 77 did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Opponents of the amendment were always planning to mount an aggressive campaign to defeat the measure, but any chance they have at victory is probably due to the Supreme Court’s ruling in June. “Post-Roe, there’s just been a huge shift,” Chuck Cordray, 59, a real-estate investor who serves on his local Democratic committee in Leawood, Kansas, told me. “There are a lot of ‘Vote No’ signs, and they’re not only in Democratic yards.”

Demonstrators marched in Albuquerque’s International District Thursday night to protest police violence after an hourslong SWAT standoff ended in a home burning down and the death of a teen who was inside.

“That young man lost his life … because the police did not stop and think about what they were doing,” said Sundra Coleman, who lived in the house. “That was somebody’s son.”

Protesters and initial news reports said the boy was 14 years old. Police have since said they aren’t certain of his age and haven’t yet identified him.

But the family who lost their home are keeping him in their minds. “Remember him,” Coleman told protesters.

Police said they don’t know the cause of the boy’s death, though information from the Office of the Medical Investigator is expected soon.

“What happened from the get-go was unacceptable,” said another resident of the house, Deja, holding her toddler in one arm and gripping a mic with her other hand. “I don’t have nowhere to go now, and I don’t know where my son is going to live. I don’t know my mom is going to live.”

Her mom worked two jobs all her life, Deja said, to raise her. When the house burned down, “they took everything,” she said.

The family was telling police a 14-year-old boy was still in the house, she said, “and they let him die, and burn.”

On Wednesday, officers were following Qiaunt Kelley, who had warrants out for his arrest, one for “unlawful taking of a vehicle out of the city of Santa Fe” and one for a probation violation, according to a police lieutenant at a news conference Thursday.

Kelley and the teen went to the house where a friend lived, according to police, and when detectives tried to arrest Kelley, he ran inside. Then SWAT was called in, Police Chief Harold Medina explained Thursday.

Copwatchers and other observers there that night attended the demonstration and said munitions SWAT officers shot into the home started the fire.

“Different types of munitions were used,” Medina said. “It is unknown exactly where in the home the individual was.”

The Albuquerque Police Department and city’s fire department said they’re investigating whether tear gas and pepper spray canisters ignited the fire — such weapons have done so when used in similar SWAT situations elsewhere.

“At the end of the day,” said Coleman’s niece before the march began, officers are “going home to their home, and my Aunty Sundra’s not going to a home.” She pointed to other relatives. “She’s not going to a home. He’s not going to a home.”

It’s unclear who gave orders preventing Albuquerque Fire Rescue from extinguishing the fire more quickly or saving the person inside. “It took time for us to turn off the fire,” Medina said. “We have to remember that the fire department, they are not police officers… It is a challenge for us to get them into an unresolved situation.”

According to a fire department news release, firefighters had to battle the flames from outside the house “in coordination with APD” because Kelley was still inside.

When Kelley came out, fire crews went inside and found the teen dead, according to the news release.

Demonstrators said the teen was brought out of the burned house and laid in the street while people demanded he be given some dignity.

“A 14-year-old Black man — Black child — a child,” Clifton White corrected himself standing in the intersection of Central and Wyoming as night fell and the protest wound down, police lights flashing behind him. “They didn’t know who he was. He could have been a 9-year-old. They didn’t care. They used their toys. They burned a house down.”

Facing threats, some election workers weigh whether to stay - By Christina A. Cassidy Associated Press

After polls closed in New Mexico's primary last month, a worker returning ballots and other election materials to the clerk's office in Santa Fe was followed by a partisan election observer driving so close that mere inches separated their bumpers.

The poll worker was so rattled by the ordeal that she said she may not return for the upcoming November election, according to Santa Fe County Clerk Katharine Clark.

The incident is just one of many in which election officials and workers have felt threatened since the 2020 presidential election and the false claims that it was stolen from former President Donald Trump. A federal effort to investigate these threats has so far yielded three prosecutions since it was launched a year ago.

In the meantime, the harassment and death threats haven't stopped against those who have pushed back against the false claims. The threats have contributed to an exodus of election officials across the country, particularly at the local level, and made recruiting poll workers even harder — adding to the challenges of conducting smooth elections in the fall.

""I'm a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff,"" said Leslie Hoffman, the top election official in Yavapai County, Arizona.

Hoffman announced last week that she was resigning to take another job, saying her decision was motivated largely by ""the nastiness that we have dealt with."" Hoffman said the county elections director left for the same reasons.

On Friday, an official with the U.S. Department of Justice was scheduled to update state election officials gathered in Louisiana for their summer conference on the work of the task force that was announced in June 2021.

Three men have been charged by federal prosecutors, with one of them pleading guilty last month. In that case, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold was the subject of multiple threatening posts on social media.

Griswold said the threats have not stopped. Just last week, a caller to her office's public phone line said: ""Hey, I've got a message for the secretary and I want you to pass it along. The angel of death is coming for her in the name of Jesus Christ.""

""The fact of the matter is they've only done three prosecutions when we know there are literally thousands and thousands of violent threats going to election workers and secretaries of state,"" Griswold said. ""People are using threats as part of the attack on democracy to try to intimidate election workers, to try to intimidate county clerks and secretaries of state, and they are succeeding in some places.""

Kenneth Polite, assistant attorney general for the department's criminal division, said federal investigators were working through each report to determine which cases can be successfully prosecuted, noting challenges in attributing threats often made anonymously and weighing free speech protections. He said additional prosecutions are expected.

""The department is committed to protecting our election community from violence and threats of violence,"" Polite said in a statement. ""These are ordinary people from across the political spectrum filling a vital democratic role for our nation, typically with little recognition or support.""

In the first six months of the task force, members conducted over 20 trainings and outreach events on election threats with state, local, and federal law enforcement as well as election officials and social media companies.

A survey released earlier this year by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU's School of Law found one in three election officials knew someone who had left a job in part because of threats and intimidation, and that one in six had experienced threats personally.

Federal and state election officials and Trump's own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the election was tainted. The former president's allegations of fraud were also roundly rejected by courts, including by judges Trump appointed.

Experts said it is critical that those making threats are held accountable to deter others from thinking they can do the same.

""The steps that the task force has taken, election officials are appreciative. But absolutely there is more to be done,"" said Liz Howard, a former state election official in Virginia now at the Brennan Center.

Among the recommendations that the Brennan Center has made is to expand the task force to include state and local law enforcement agencies that are typically the first contact for an election official.

A group of former and current election and law enforcement officials recently formed the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, which plans to provide guidance and training for preventing and responding to threats and violence against election officials.

Last month, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- which distributes federal grants to election offices -- said its funding could be used to protect election officials against threats. Legislation has also been pursued at the state and federal level to increase penalties for those targeting election workers.

In Colorado, lawmakers passed a bill that makes it a misdemeanor to release online the personal information of an election official for the purpose of threatening them or their family.

On Capitol Hill, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, held a hearing last year highlighting the threats and urging federal protections for election workers. Klobuchar and other Senate Democrats have sent a letter asking the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to issue a joint public service announcement to local law enforcement agencies to ""ensure that they are aware of both the recent increase in these threats against election officials and federal resources for reporting and countering them.""

Back in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Clark said anxiety remains high among her staff. Employees have been trained on active shooter situations, they have requested bulletproof glass be installed and GPS tracking is used during the transportation of ballot boxes.

While she is concerned about her safety, she says she's not ready to quit or change careers, noting her responsibility to voters who elected her.

""My dad served in the military, my grandfather served in the military,"" Clark said. ""I don't feel it's bad enough yet to feel that my public service is too much.""

Associated Press writers Bob Christie in Phoenix and Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico, contributed to this report.

Hiker found dead at White Sands National Park - Associated Press

A 27-year-old hiker who went missing while visiting White Sands National Park has been found dead, authorities said Friday.

New Mexico state police and officials at the southern New Mexico park reported that rescue teams discovered the body of Brad Utegaar of Wausau, Wisconsin, earlier this week after a search was initiated over the holiday weekend. A military helicopter and state and federal officers helped with the effort.

Utegaar's car had been parked at the Alkali Flats Trail for two days. His body was found about 2 miles northeast of the trail.

State Police Officer Ray Wilson said there did not appear to be any foul play and that Utegaar had a backpack and water bottles with him.

Utegaard's family told authorities in New Mexico that he was on a cross country trip alone.

Several people have died among the white sand dunes over the years, and park officials on Friday warned again about the dangers of hiking in extreme temperatures as there is no shade or water along any of the trails at the park. It was exactly one year ago that a hiker from northern New Mexico was found dead at the park.

Officials recommended that hikers bring at least 1 gallon (3.79 litres) of water per person per day and high energy snacks along with a hat and sunscreen.

Restrictions on prison mail don’t appear to decrease drug use, legislative report says - Austin Fisher, Source New Mexico

Restrictions on personal mail for people incarcerated in New Mexico prisons have not had any effect on drug use, according to legislative analysts, even though state prison officials said the new policy was meant to prevent drugs from getting inside. And the contractor that processes the mail has likely made over $100,000 so far.

The New Mexico Corrections Department in December told incarcerated people’s families that it would ban personal mail in prisons, and directed them to send their letters to private company Securus in Florida, which creates photocopies and sends those on to the prisons.

Incarcerated people, their families and advocates say the restrictions isolate them from their loved ones, and violate their basic humanity.

The department previously said Securus will charge the state $3.50 for each prisoner in the state’s prisons, at the beginning of every month.

In April, the number of people held in New Mexico prisons averaged 5,651, according to the Legislative Finance Committee. That means Securus made around $19,778 in April.

If the average prison population has stayed the same since the department hired Securus, then the company has made an estimated $118,000 so far processing mail.

At the time, the department said new procedure and expense were needed because of contraband smuggled in through the mail.

But a report from the LFC published on June 6 raises questions about how drugs are really getting into New Mexico prisons.

Every three months, the LFC publishes quarterly reports on how various state agencies are performing. According to the latest quarterly report on the Corrections Department, the new prison mail policy “does not appear to have reduced drug use in the third quarter.”

In fact, the proportion of positive results from random drug tests on people incarcerated in state prisons rose from 2% between July 2020 and June 2021 to 3.7% between July 2021 and February 2022, according to the Legislative Finance Committee.

The report said the increase was significant and “reverses three years of reduced drug use.”

Corrections Department spokesperson Carmelina Hart said in a written statement Wednesday that “there will always be those who are inventive in their attempts to skirt the rules, and eliminating contraband is a daily endeavor.”

“But, with the increased use of body scanners and security searches, and extensive efforts by our dedicated security professionals, NMCD is continuously working to reduce the introduction of contraband,” Hart said. “The department will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the changes to our mail system policy.”

The LFC suggests that results on drug use in prisons should be monitored to determine if the prison mail policy is having its intended impact.

Rep. Gail Chasey (D-Albuquerque), co-chair of the Courts, Corrections & Justice Committee which meets between legislative sessions, said members intend to ask the department to explain its rationale for the policy, show evidence of whether it is working and for details about other options officials explored before paying Securus to screen N.M. prison mail in Florida.

Chasey expects the committee will want to hear more about this LFC evaluation of the practice “as early as possible,” she said. “The committee will also seek information from experts regarding evidence-based practices to reduce drug use in prison and to protect correctional staff.”

Independent lawmaker Sen. Jacob Candelaria, who is also a civil rights attorney, on Jan. 4 submitted a records request to the state’s Corrections Department asking for all documents related to its new prison mail policy, because it could still be subject to challenge.

On Wednesday, over six months later, Candelaria said he had received no response from the department to the records request.

“It’s clear to us at this juncture that the Corrections Department is in absolute, glaring violation of the Inspection of Public Records Act, which for me raises additional red flags and concerns about whether or not there is even a rational basis to support what the agency has done in this policy,” he said, “which has had the net effect of severely limiting the communication that inmates have with the outside world, and thus infringing upon their First Amendment rights.”

New Mexico plans for more electric vehicle charging stations - By Susan Montoya Bryan Associated Press

The first in a series of electric vehicle charging stations that will be paid for with state and federal infrastructure money will be installed in Socorro, one of the few populated areas along a major interstate that spans New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Thursday.

The first-term Democrat used her visit to the central New Mexico community to tout efforts to fund infrastructure projects as she seeks reelection. She also planned stops in Clovis and Roswell over the coming days.

She said $10 million secured through the legislative process will be spent to develop the charging network. Another $38 million in federal funding will bolster the work as state officials aim to have charging stations every 50 miles along New Mexico's interstates.

""New Mexico has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make truly transformative investments in communities large and small around our state,"" the governor said.

The Biden administration earlier this year announced the availability of $5 billion for states over five years to help create seamless electric vehicle travel from coast to coast. The money was far less than the $15 billion that Biden had envisioned to fulfill a campaign promise of 500,000 charging stations by 2030.

New Mexico regulators in May adopted more stringent motor vehicle emissions standards that supporters say will boost the number of electric vehicles available for sale in the state. Lujan Grisham has called for more electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles to be sold as part of her push against climate change.

However, access to charging stations has been an issue for consumers and utility executives are still working on plans to ensure they have enough capacity to meet future electricity demands as more solar and battery storage facilities are bought online to replace coal-fired power plants.

The new charging station in Socorro will be installed on city property near the historic plaza and not far from the New Mexico Tech campus. Officials said it will be available for use in the next few weeks.

Michael Jackson, the associate vice president of academic affairs at Tech, said building out an alternative fuel corridor will expand access and reliability for those who have electric vehicles and local economies like the one in Socorro can benefit by travelers stopping for a charge.

New Mexico school trust feels pressure; voters weigh changes - Associated Press

State investments are being buffeted by turbulent financial markets as New Mexico voters consider whether to divert more money each year toward early childhood education programs.

A report Thursday from the Legislature's budget and accountability office shows that the state's four major public pension and permanent funds shrank by about $825 million during the first three months of the year amid a federal interest-rate hike, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a wave of COVID-19 infections.

The losses are a tiny share of the funds' $66.3 billion valuation that grew by 40% over the past five years — a $19 billion surge.

A statewide referendum in November will decide whether to increase annual distributions slightly from the state's nearly $26 billion Land Grant Permanent Fund. That fund is sustained by investment returns along with oil extraction and other natural resource development on state trust lands.

Currently 5% of the fund balance each year goes mainly toward public schools and universities. The referendum would increase the rate to 6.25% to provide roughly an additional $200 million to public education.

The increased withdrawals would go toward public school funding for at-risk students and early childhood education programs.

Advocates for the increase want to expand programs such as pre-K, child care assistance and voluntary home-visits to new parents. Critics worry the changes undermine the growth and sustainability of trust.

The referendum would amend to the state's constitution and also requires authorization from Congress.

Police: Teenage boy found dead after Albuquerque standoff - Associated Press

A teenager has been found dead inside a southeast Albuquerque home after a fire, and a suspect who was the subject of standoff at the home has been arrested, authorities said Thursday.

The fire ended the overnight SWAT standoff with the suspect, and the body of a 14-year-old boy was later located in the house.

Police said the suspect, whose name wasn't immediately released, was wanted on a federal felony warrant for robbery and is a person of interest in several violent crimes in the Albuquerque area.

The suspect was tracked to the home and he and the teen hid in the house, according to police who said smoke was seen coming out from windows around 3 a.m. Thursday.

The suspect reportedly exited the home as firefighters extinguished the flames. He was taken into custody and then transported to a local hospital for burn injuries.

Authorities stressed that no officers fired their weapons during the standoff. Those who lived at the home questioned whether gas canisters fired by the SWAT team sparked the blaze, the Albuquerque Journal reported.

Police Chief Harold Medina said the team uses Tri-Chamber canisters when trying to get someone to surrender.

""They're built in a way that's supposed to reduce the likelihood of causing a fire. And it's something we use over and over — in tons of calls,"" he said.

Medina said arson investigators were working to determine how the fire started and the dead teenager has yet to be identified.

Scramble as last Mississippi abortion clinic shuts its doors - By Emily Wagster Pettus Associated Press

Mississippi's only abortion clinic has been buzzing with activity in the chaotic days since the U.S. Supreme Court upended abortion rights nationwide — a case that originated in this conservative Deep South state, with this bright-pink medical facility that is closing its doors Wednesday.

Physicians at Jackson Women's Health Organization have been trying to see as many patients as possible before Thursday, when, barring an unlikely intervention by the state's conservative Supreme Court, Mississippi will enact a law to ban most abortions.

Amid stifling summer heat and humidity, clashes intensified Wednesday between anti-abortion protesters and volunteers escorting patients into the clinic, best known as the Pink House.

When Dr. Cheryl Hamlin, who has traveled from Boston for five years to perform abortions, walked outside the Pink House, an abortion opponent used a bullhorn to yell at her. ""Repent! Repent!"" shouted Doug Lane.

His words were drowned out by abortion rights supporter Beau Black, who repeatedly screamed at Lane: ""Hypocrites and Pharisees! Hypocrites and Pharisees!""

Abortion access has become increasingly limited across wide swaths of the U.S. as conservative states enact restrictions or bans that took effect when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

The court, reshaped by three conservative justices appointed by former President Donald Trump, issued the ruling June 24. But the Mississippi clinic has been inundated with patients since September, when Texas enacted a ban on abortion early in pregnancy.

Cars with license plates from Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas have been driving through Jackson's Fondren neighborhood to bring women and girls— some of whom appeared to be teenagers — to the Pink House. Drivers parked on side streets near the clinic in the shade of pink and purple crepe myrtles, their car air-conditioners blasting as they waited.

Diane Derzis, who has owned the Mississippi clinic since 2010, drove to Jackson to speak at the Pink House hours after the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.

""It's been such an honor and a privilege to be in Mississippi. I've come to love this state and the people in it,"" Derzis told those gathered in the sweltering heat.

The Supreme Court ruling was in a case called Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization — the clinic's challenge of a 2018 Mississippi law to ban most abortions after 15 weeks. The Pink House had been doing abortions through 16 weeks, but under previous U.S. Supreme Court rulings, abortion was allowed to the point of fetal viability at about 24 weeks.

Mississippi's top public health official, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, was named in the lawsuit, but has not taken a public position about the case. The state's Republican attorney general urged justices to use the case to overturn Roe v. Wade and give states more power to regulate or ban abortion.

Derzis told The Associated Press after the ruling that she didn't regret filing the lawsuit that eventually undercut nearly five decades of abortion case law.

""We didn't have a choice. And if it hadn't been this lawsuit, it would have been another one,"" said Derzis, who also owns abortion clinics in Georgia and Virginia, and lives in Alabama.

The Mississippi clinic uses out-of-state physicians like Dr. Hamlin because no in-state doctors will work there.

As the Pink House prepared to close, Dr. Hamlin said she worries about women living in deep poverty in parts of the state with little access to health care.

""People say, 'Oh, what am I supposed to do?'"" she said. ""And I'm like, 'Vote.'""

Shannon Brewer, the Pink House director, agrees low-income women will be most affected by being unable to get abortions in-state.

Brewer told the AP the anti-abortion protesters know her by name and yell at her but she tunes them out.

""They don't say a lot to me anymore other than, you know, 'You're coming to work to kill babies,'"" Brewer said. ""I've been here for 20-something years. So, it's like when I get out of the car I don't really hear it because it's like the same thing over and over and over again.""

Some staffers were expected to be in the Pink House on Thursday for paperwork ahead of its closure, but no procedures.

With the Mississippi clinic closing, Derzis and Brewer will soon open an abortion clinic in Las Cruces, New Mexico, about an hour's drive from El Paso, Texas, — calling it Pink House West. Hamlin said she is getting licensed in New Mexico so she can work there.

Mississippi and New Mexico are two of the poorest states in the U.S., but have vastly different positions on abortion politics and access.

Home to a Democratic-led legislature and governor, New Mexico recently took an extra step to protect providers and patients from out-of-state prosecutions. It's likely to continue to see a steady influx of people seeking abortions from neighboring states with more restrictive abortion laws.

One of the largest abortion providers in Texas, Whole Woman's Health, announced Wednesday that it is also planning to reopen in New Mexico in a city near the state line, to provide first- and second-trimester abortions. It began winding down operations in Texas after a ruling Friday by the state Supreme Court that forced an end to abortions at its four clinics.

Standing outside the Mississippi clinic on June 24, Derzis was pragmatic about the future of the building she had painted bright pink several years ago.

""This building will be sold and maybe someone will knock it down and make a parking lot here,"" Derzis said. ""And that will be sad, but she served her purpose and many women had their abortions here.""

Raichik promised a legal war against the far-left Silicon Valley company in a blog post following her most recent suspension for “hateful conduct,” a charge she vehemently denies.

Twitter suspended Libs of TikTok last week for so-called “hateful conduct” after the account shared a recording of Children’s National Hospital staff saying the hospital performs transgender-related hysterectomies on minors.

“I was wrongfully suspended from Twitter for seven days after I exposed a hospital that admitted to performing gender-affirming hysterectomies on healthy minors,” Raichik said Saturday in a blog post. “I say ‘wrongfully’ because the reason given for my suspension was hateful conduct. I did not engage in hateful conduct. I accurately reported the truth.”

“My biggest fan, Taylor Lorenz, wrote another hit piece about me yesterday claiming that Twitter executives are facing ‘internal pressure from some employees to respond more aggressively’ to my account,” she added.

Earlier this year, Washington Post tech columnist Taylor Lorenz revealed the identity of Raichik — who was initially anonymous — as the individual who owns the popular Twitter account, claiming “for all we knew, this could have been a foreign actor.”

“The only thing more aggressive than a seven-day suspension would be a permanent ban. But if that happens — if they ban my account for hateful conduct when all I’ve done is report the facts — then I’ll sue them for breach of contract,” Raichik continued in her blog post.

“I’ll also bring claims under California state law and the California Constitution,” she affirmed.

Twitter’s seven-day suspension of Libs of TikTok comes after the account posted an audio recording of a phone call between Children’s National Hospital staff and Raichik, who posed as a parent of a 16-year-old with gender dysphoria, seeking to schedule a consultation so that the minor can receive a hysterectomy.

In the phone call, an employee is heard claiming that the hospital has performed transgender-related surgeries on minors, including on children younger than 16.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/gabby-petito-case-one-year-domestic-violence-incident-could-prevented-murder,Gabby Petito case: One year on from a domestic violence incident that could have prevented a murder,"If you or someone you know is the victim of domestic abuse, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233.

Moab police responded to a domestic violence call involving the late van life travel blogger Gabby Petito and her suspected killer ex Brian Laundrie one year ago Thursday.

The ill-fated encounter, recorded on harrowing police bodycam video, preceded Petito’s brutal strangling at Laundrie’s hands just two weeks later.

Despite a Utah statute that requires someone to be arrested or cited during a domestic response, no such action was taken.

GABBY PETITO'S PARENTS ANNOUNCE WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT AGAINST MOAB POLICE OVER BRIAN LAUNDRIE 911 CALL

The couple left on a cross-country road trip in June 2021, taking Petito’s converted Ford Transit van on a tour of national and state parks, chronicled on Petito’s Instagram and YouTube accounts.

Her disappearance under suspicious circumstances garnered international attention and spotlighted missing persons and domestic violence cases.

In the year that followed her death, her parents founded and built up a national nonprofit that continues to raise awareness.

The Gabby Petito Foundation

In response to their daughter’s tragic story, Petito’s parents and stepparents founded the Gabby Petito Foundation to raise awareness of missing persons and domestic violence.

The organization became a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit on Oct. 22, 2021, and last week announced a $100,000 donation to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

""Domestic violence can be stopped, and organizations like the Hotline are at the forefront of ensuring that survivors get the support they need to seek a safer future,"" Nichole Schmidt, Petito’s mother, said in the announcement. ""We support organizations doing this life-saving work and encourage everyone to join us by making a gift to The Hotline’s emergency campaign. Thousands of people in need are depending on us.""

Answering questions from Fox News Digital and other outlets at a news briefing Monday regarding the family’s intent to sue Moab police for their handling of the Aug. 12 call, Petito’s parents said they hope her case will encourage other people trapped in abusive relationships to seek help and get out as soon as possible.

""Reach out if you can,"" Nichole Schmidt, said during the briefing, wiping tears from her eyes. ""Reach out to someone.""

The foundation declined to comment for this story, deferring to the parents’ Monday remarks.

""All we can hope is that Gabby’s legacy will be a positive one,"" Jim Schmidt, Petito’s stepfather, said. ""That people will see her, and they recognize her and possibly compare maybe what they’re going through in their life and make a positive change.""

To that end, the National Domestic Violence Hotline says the number of calls it has received since Petito’s story seized global headlines last summer has doubled to almost 80,000 a month.

""People care; we care; there are people that care,"" Joseph Petito, Gabby’s father, added. ""And we think everyone out there should know that there are people who will do whatever we can to help.""

GABBY PETITO HOMICIDE: TIMELINE OF DISAPPEARANCE WITH BRIAN LAUNDRIE

The Moab Incident

After Petito’s mother, Nichole Schmidt, reported her missing on Sept. 11, 2021, Fox News Digital was the first media outlet to uncover the Moab domestic violence call – in which a witness told police he saw Laundrie hitting and slapping Petito and attempting to drive off without her.

Petito climbed in through the window, according to the witness, and Laundrie slammed the car into a curb when police pulled the couple over outside town on the entrance ramp to Arches National Park a few minutes later.

The crossroads city’s police department drew scrutiny after a pair of bodycam videos were released in response to public records requests. Petito appeared in hysterics – upset the entire time, crying, motioning at her face and neck, where she suggested Laundrie had grabbed and scratched her. Lawyers for her parents earlier this week said a previously unreleased photo will show blood smeared over her face – something not clearly visible in the bodycam footage.

Laundrie was calm and collected and struck up a conversational tone with officers – despite lying to them about having a cellphone.

Laundrie told the officers that he didn’t have a phone and was afraid Petito was the one who would drive off on him and leave him without a way to communicate.

GABBY PETITO'S MOTHER SLAMS BRIAN LAUNDRIE'S NOTEBOOK CONFESSION

""I was holding onto the keys because I didn’t want to go anywhere, and my big fear is, I don’t have my phone. I don't really – I don’t have a phone. So if she goes off without me…I’m on my own,"" he said in the bodycam video.

About 40 minutes later, they asked him for his phone number. He took a phone out of his pocket. But the officers never pressed him on this inconsistency.

Police made no arrests or citations despite a Utah statute requiring one to be issued in domestic violence incidents. After interviewing both Petito and Laundrie, as well as another witness, officers ruled out domestic violence and deemed the incident a ""mental health break.""

An outside investigation into Moab police’s handling of the Aug. 12 stop found ""unintentional mistakes"" – and issued recommendations on how the department should move forward.

Moab has not provided Fox News Digital with any documents, comment or confirmation that any of these recommendations had been followed. A city spokesperson declined to comment Monday citing a policy on pending litigation.

Price, Utah, Police Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe, who conducted the outside review, did not respond to requests for an interview.

""I am confident and comfortable in stating the mistakes that were made were not made intentionally,"" he wrote in the report.

Pratt, who also did not respond to an interview request and is named in a pending notice of claim filed by Petito’s parents, is quoted in Ratcliffe’s report as skeptical of Laundrie’s innocence.

""Brian didn't get away with anything for being cute, and Brian showed more red flags than a Chinese Communist rally going on that he was a s----- boyfriend,"" Pratt told Ratcliffe. But, he claimed, ""I couldn't charge him. The fingernail thing, the way it was described by [the redacted witness] and Gabby, even if I didn't clarify it with him, that's not something I can arrest him for.""

Police ultimately ordered the couple to split up for the night. They left Petito with the converted camper van and drove Laundrie to a motel on Main Street, where the manager told Fox News Digital he could not confirm that the 23-year-old actually spent the night.

""We believe that these officers were negligent, and their negligence contributed to Gabby’s death,"" said Bryan Stewart, a Salt Lake City-based attorney representing the Petito and Schmidt families. ""They did not understand the law and did not apply the law properly in Gabby’s situation.""

Brian’s Break and Gabby’s Final Days

The couple's Aug. 12 fight, in part, grew out of an argument they'd had at a Moab coffee shop as Petito worked on her travel videos, according to conversations captured on police bodycam.

On Aug. 17, 2021, Laundrie flew home to Florida alone. During this break, Petito posted a video to her Van Life YouTube channel, painting a peachy portrait of the first half of the couple’s journey. Her REI water bottle, hung prominently in the back of the van in this video, would later turn up near Laundrie’s remains.

Laundrie returned to Utah where he and Petito resumed their road trip on Aug. 23.

Petito made her final Instagram post on Aug. 25. That’s also the last day she spoke with her family, according to her mother, Nichole Schmidt.

On or around Aug. 28, according to a lawsuit filed by Petito’s parents against Laundrie’s, the aspiring travel blogger was killed in Bridger-Teton National Forest north of Jackson, Wyoming. An FBI-led search effort found her remains there on Sept. 19. Laundrie confessed to the killing in a notebook entry found near his remains the following October, as Fox News Digital was first to report.

After Petito’s death, Laundrie drove cross-country from Wyoming to his parent’s house in North Port, Florida. He arrived on Sept. 1 and refused to speak with police or answer questions from the public. The Laundrie family went camping from Sept. 6 to 8, as Petito’s parents were still desperate for answers. Within days, Laundrie snuck off into the nearby Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park and shot himself in the head, according to the FBI.

BRIAN LAUNDRIE FOUND: PARENTS MAY HAVE JUST MISSED UNCOVERING REMAINS THEMSELVES

Fox News Digital was in the park with Laundrie’s parents and investigators five weeks later – when they found his partial remains and a dry bag that contained a handwritten confession, in which he wrote, ""I ended her life.""

""I thought it was merciful, that it is what she wanted, but I see now all the mistakes I made,"" he continued. ""I panicked. I was in shock.""

Laundrie was the only person of interest and suspect in Petito’s death. She was beaten and strangled, according to the Teton County coroner Dr. Brent Blue.

The Lawsuit Against Moab Police

In addition to a pair of lawsuits filed against Laundrie’s parents, Petito’s family has also filed a $50 million notice of claim against the Moab Police Department, Officers Eric Pratt and Daniel Robbins, as well as former Assistant Chief Braydon Palmer and former Chief Bret Edge. They are alleging negligence and poor training on behalf of the city are to blame for their daughter’s death.

But such claims are hard to prove, according to legal experts.

Mike Padden, a St. Paul-based civil rights attorney who has battled Minneapolis police in a wrongful death case, said the Moab police will likely claim immunity.

""With a case like that, it’s difficult, I think it’s gonna be a really tough case for the plaintiff,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""The lawyers representing law enforcement have probably taken the position that their clients are entitled to immunity – and I think that will be a really strong argument.""

He predicted a motion to dismiss could come quickly.

He also said the court might find Ratcliffe’s independent investigation inadmissible.

""That’s evidence that would invade the province of the jury,"" he said. ""That would typically not be admissible because it’s an entity that’s looking at the facts and reaching a conclusion – and that’s for the jury to decide.""

Or, he said, the report could help the defense.

""They may have made the wrong decision, but that’s the whole point here – that’s why they have immunity,"" he said. ""It’s a difficult decision, and even if they ultimately didn’t make the right decision, they should not be treated unfairly for not making the right decision.""

Neama Rahmani, a Los Angeles-based trial attorney and former federal prosecutor who has been following the Petito story since it began, agreed.

""The Petito lawsuit against the Moab Police Department will likely be dismissed,"" he said. ""Law enforcement is generally immune from civil liability for a failure to act, unless there is a specific legal duty like a duty to provide medical aide.""

He said the Petito’s have a better case against Laundrie’s parents, if they can prove they helped their son escape after the slaying.

""Though the Moab officers probably should have arrested Laundrie, or both Laundrie and Petito, that failure is not actionable under civil law,"" he said.

Padden said he thinks the Petito-Schmidt family could fare better with a federal lawsuit against Moab than in Utah state court.

Attorneys for the Petito-Schmidt family said they would argue that immunity in this case is unconstitutional and would allow the department to escape responsibility for its own actions.

(Photo for The Washington Post by Andrea Morales)

The Center for Reproductive Rights on Tuesday filed legal actions in Tennessee, Idaho and Oklahoma on behalf of women who say they were denied abortion care in medical emergencies.

The actions represent an escalation of the strategy the center used earlier this year in a Texas lawsuit arguing that exceptions to protect the life or health of the mother are unclear, jeopardizing the health of pregnant women.

“What’s happening in Texas is the tip of the iceberg,” said Marc Hearron, the center’s senior counsel who is spearheading the three legal actions. The goal, Hearron said, is twofold - to demonstrate that pregnant people are being denied timely medical care wherever abortion is banned, and to give clarity to doctors who he described as “terrified” of providing the procedure.

Antiabortion groups accuse their opponents of exaggerating the risks to pregnant individuals, dismissing legal actions at the state level as “scare tactics” because abortion rights groups are losing the federal battle. What’s more, they said, broadly written exceptions could allow any abortion clinic to find a health exception to justify the procedure.

In early August, in a temporary victory for abortion rights advocates, a Texas judge ruled that in cases of dangerous or complicated pregnancies, doctors must be allowed to use their “good faith judgment” to provide abortion care. The state immediately appealed the ruling, which is now on hold. Oral arguments are scheduled for late November.

As in Texas, the new filings - lawsuits against the states of Idaho and Tennessee and a federal complaint lodged with the Department of Health and Human Services against a hospital in Oklahoma - do not seek to overturn the abortion bans entirely. Instead, they use personal testimony to expose the physical and mental trauma plaintiffs say they suffered because doctors failed to perform abortions for fear of liability.

The lawsuits in Tennessee and Idaho, a state where there has been an exodus of obstetric specialists in the past year, include physician plaintiffs. They outline the dilemmas confronting doctors who can face penalties including fines, the loss of their medical licenses and prison terms if they perform procedures that are found to violate the bans.

Nicole Blackmon, the lead plaintiff in the Tennessee lawsuit, realized she was pregnant in July 2022. The news came as a happy surprise in a turbulent time of her life, she said. Her son, Daniel, had been slain in a drive-by shooting earlier that year, according to the complaint, and she was managing serious health issues, including a form of hypertension that causes extreme headaches and can lead to vision loss.

Blackmon stopped taking her anti-inflammatory medication to protect the fetus, she said. But a routine, 15-week ultrasound revealed the baby’s stomach and other organs were developing outside its abdomen, as well as showing signs of a lethal malformation known as limb body wall complex, the lawsuit said. In the following weeks, as further tests confirmed the diagnoses, Blackmon said her health worsened.

“It was so much to bear,” Blackmon told The Washington Post. “It was the scariest point in my life. The baby was putting my life at risk.”

After her doctors told her they could not perform an abortion, Blackmon, 31, who lives in Nashville, said she looked into obtaining one outside of Tennessee but felt that traveling was beyond her means. Two months before her due date, as her vision deteriorated and she developed signs of life-threatening preeclampsia, Blackmon’s water broke, according to the complaint. After 32 hours of labor, she delivered a stillborn baby, she said.

“Going through all of that, I don’t want no one to have to suffer or just have to bear the things that I went through. I was lucky enough to survive all of that, but the next person might not be lucky,” Blackmon said. “It made me frightened to go through another pregnancy.”

A spokeswoman for Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti declined to respond, saying they had not reviewed the complaint.

The galvanizing impact this kind of personal testimony can have on public opinion was demonstrated by the Texas case, said Rachel Rebouché, a professor of law at Temple University who specializes in reproductive health law.

That lawsuit drew widespread attention in large part because of the plaintiffs’ graphic, first-person accounts in court. In one particularly harrowing moment, a woman vomited on the stand when she recalled how abandoned she felt after she learned of her baby’s fatal anomalies.

“What has changed a lot of people’s minds have been these high-profile cases of people who have very wanted pregnancies, but nonetheless have been told, ‘Sorry, we cannot provide you care,’” said Rebouché, who noted that abortion access is now the focus of several recent ballot initiatives across the country.

The new cases also raise legal questions about whether states are meeting their obligations to their citizens, she said. “Even outside the court of public opinion, the state may be failing to protect people’s right to life under the state constitution or another law.”

Steven Aden, general counsel for Americans United for Life, accused reproductive rights advocates of creating “a fabrication to scare the public.”

“All of the pro-life doctors I’ve talked to say that there is no state law that prohibits treating a pregnant women who is in emergent circumstances,” Aden said.

The strategy of showing the alleged harm that people with complicated pregnancies have suffered is one front in the abortion battles that have moved largely to the states in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal constitutional right to abortion, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

“The abortion industry pivoted after Dobbs because they realized there was no go in the federal courts,” Aden said.

That has put new energy behind ongoing efforts to establish a constitutional right to abortion in states.

“The thinking is, ‘Let’s do at the state level what Roe did at the national level,’” said attorney Ed Whelan, referring to Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a federal right to abortion. But there are limitations to that approach, according to Whelan, a senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank: State constitutions are comparatively easy to amend, so the right could be overturned.

But Hearron said the Texas suit was revelatory to people who heard the testimony. “Many people who don’t think they know somebody who has had an abortion are now realizing it affects all of us,” he said.

The testimony also encouraged women in other states to speak out about their experiences, he said.

Allie Phillips, another Tennessee plaintiff, documented her pregnancy loss on social media, describing the turmoil of discovering during a routine ultrasound at 18 weeks and 5 days that her second baby, Miley Rose, had multiple deformities. Two weeks later, the 28-year-old from Clarksville, who suffers from dehydration following gastric sleeve surgery, traveled to New York for an abortion, where she learned Miley had already died.

Jennifer Adkins, 31, a plaintiff in the Idaho lawsuit, said she never imagined she would sue her state over abortion care. After a 12-week ultrasound revealed her baby’s many defects, doctors warned she was at risk for a rare but dangerous condition known as mirror syndrome, in which the mother’s body begins to mimic the fetus’s life-threatening symptoms. But Adkins said they told her the law prevented them from providing an abortion. She ultimately obtained one in Oregon.

“I can’t stop bad things from happening to people’s pregnancies,” Adkins said. “But I want other Idahoans to feel safe and cared for.”

Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador did not respond to requests for comment.

Most of the 14 states where abortion is banned have exceptions for medical emergencies, according to KFF, a health policy organization that tracks state laws. Many doctors have argued that those exceptions are written in nonmedical language and fail to reflect the health risks to a mother that come with pregnancy and childbirth.

“People completely underestimate how dangerous a pregnancy can be, even to a healthy person,” said Mae Winchester, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Ohio. A six-week ban took effect immediately in Ohio after the Dobbs ruling until a judge blocked its enforcement; the state is expected to appeal.

Risks are greater for the many women with preexisting conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. A lethal fetal anomaly adds complications for women weighing the risks to their health, Winchester said. Specialists are avoiding practicing in states with bans, she said, which impacts all kinds of gynecological care — such as the provision of Pap smears and hysterectomies for fibroids.

But Ingrid Skop, an OB/GYN and an expert witness for the state in the Texas lawsuit, has written about managing complex pregnancies during the three decades she practiced in Texas and said her practice remains the same in the wake of the state’s abortion bans.

Skop, who also works for the antiabortion Charlotte Lozier Institute, blames “media misinformation” and “lack of clarity by professional organizations” for the confusion doctors now say they are experiencing. “Rather than reading the law, many physicians read newspapers instead and have erroneously concluded that state pro-life laws prioritized fetal life over the life of the woman,” Skop wrote on the institute’s website.

In an interview, Emily Corrigan, an emergency obstetrician and plaintiff in the Idaho lawsuit, said she has witnessed the chilling impact on her colleagues, several of whom have left the state.

Corrigan’s work, often in the emergency room, is usually protected by a federal law — the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act — requiring hospitals to stabilize patients with an emergency medical condition.

The Center for Reproductive Rights’s legal action in Oklahoma focuses on that issue. In the complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Jaci Statton describes the pain and nausea she says she suffered when she discovered that she had a partial molar pregnancy, meaning the fetus would not survive and she was at risk of hemorrhage.

According to the complaint, Statton arrived — bleeding and barely able to walk — at the Oklahoma Medical Center, where she was denied an abortion and instead sent to the Oklahoma Children’s Hospital. There, the complaint says, she and her husband begged staff members to perform an abortion but were told to wait in the parking lot until her condition deteriorated. Statton fled the state on a three-hour drive to get an abortion in Kansas, according to the complaint.

OU Health attorney Paul Neimeyer did not respond to requests for comment.

The complaint comes after the Center for Reproductive Rights had successfully challenged some of Oklahoma’s abortion bans last year on the grounds that the exceptions were too narrow.

With little possibility of advancing their cause in federal courts, abortion rights groups are fighting the 15-week ban in Florida, where oral arguments were held Friday, and the six-week ban in South Carolina, in addition to these new actions.

https://cdispatch.com/opinions/2022-07-05/bobby-harrison-supreme-court-could-assure-abortion-ban-in-mississippi-or-people-could-vote/,"Bobby Harrison: Supreme Court could assure abortion ban in Mississippi, or people could vote","For abortion to be banned in Mississippi, a 1998 Supreme Court ruling — that “abortion is protected” under the state Constitution — must be reversed.

The most obvious way for that reversal to occur is for the same Mississippi Supreme Court, but with different judges than in 1998, to write a new decision saying abortion is not a protected right under the state Constitution.

The state Supreme Court most likely will have a chance to make that reversal thanks to a lawsuit filed claiming a Mississippi trigger law banning most abortions upon the repeal of Roe v. Wade cannot go into effect because of the 1998 state Supreme Court ruling. A very conservative Supreme Court can simply reverse that 1998 decision and the trigger law can go into effect banning most abortions in the state.

But another way to reverse that 1998 decision is to let the people vote.

Gov. Tate Reeves could call a special session of the Mississippi Legislature for the purpose of passing a constitutional resolution. That resolution — presumably to ban abortion or most abortions in Mississippi — would then go before the voters. If the voters approved it, presto — abortion would be banned.

The election could take place on Nov. 8 — the date of the already scheduled general election. But if legislators wanted, they could schedule a special election earlier to vote on the constitutional amendment to ban abortions. In the past, legislators have scheduled votes on constitutional amendments for dates other than the date of the regularly scheduled general election.

Until the 1998 Pro-Choice Mississippi v. Fordice is overturned either by a new Supreme Court ruling or by the vote of the people, it is difficult to see a path for the trigger law to take effect in the state. It is the same principle that applied nationally in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision — abortion could not be banned until the U.S. Supreme Court wrote a new decision reversing the Roe decision that said abortion rights were protected by the federal Constitution.

The U.S. Supreme Court, of course, reversed Roe in late June in a Mississippi case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. But the U.S. Supreme Court in the Dobbs ruling did not and could not reverse what the state Supreme Court said in 1998 about the right to an abortion being found in the Mississippi Constitution.

“We find that the state constitutional right to privacy includes an implied right to choose whether or not to have an abortion,” the late Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Michael Sullivan wrote for the majority in 1998.

Sullivan further wrote that when the Mississippi Constitution was written in 1890, “abortion was legal until quickening (until fetus movement) some four to five months into pregnancy.”

There has been only one statewide vote involving abortion, which occurred in 2011 on what was known as the “personhood amendment.” The proposal would have defined as a person “every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the equivalent thereof.”

The ballot initiative process, where sponsors gather signatures to place issues before voters, was used for the personhood amendment. It was soundly defeated 58% to 42% by voters even though most of the state’s politicians, including Phil Bryant who was elected governor that year, supported it. Had it passed, the proposal would have been placed in the state Constitution.

The personhood proposal might have gone steps further on banning abortions than most Mississippi voters wanted to go. Based on the personhood vote, even many conservative Mississippians favor exemptions from abortion bans for the life of the mother, for rape and for other reasons. But on the other hand, House Speaker Philip Gunn said recently he believes life begins at conception and did not appear to favor any exemptions.

Legislators could craft the constitutional ban as strict or with as many exceptions as they want and then let the people vote.

One of the primary arguments used for overturning Roe v. Wade was that courts should not decide the controversial issue.

Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart, arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court for Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office in the landmark Dobbs case, said, “The Constitution places its trust in the people. On hard issue after hard issue, the people make this country work. Abortion is a hard issue. It demands the best from all of us, not a judgment by just a few of us. When an issue affects everyone — and when the Constitution does not take sides on it — it belongs to the people.”

https://www.pressherald.com/2022/09/14/potential-railroad-strike-would-damage-struggling-u-s-economy-but-some-effects-in-maine-unclear/,"Potential railroad strike would damage struggling U.S. economy, but effects in Maine unclear","Before railroad companies and unions representing tens of thousands of railroad workers across the U.S. reached a tentative agreement, Maine businesses and transportation officials waited to see how a strike might affect the state.

Nate Moulton, director of freight and business services at the Maine Department of Transportation, put it simply: “It would not be a good thing.”

About 60,000 union workers for the country’s largest freight haulers, known as Class I railroads, had been prepared to strike if they couldn’t reach an agreement on a contract with better working conditions. Experts say a national strike would wreak havoc on the country’s already stressed supply chain and deliver a major blow to the U.S. economy.

President Joe Biden said Thursday that a tentative railway labor agreement had been reached, averting a potentially devastating strike before the pivotal midterm elections.

He said the tentative deal “will keep our critical rail system working and avoid disruption of our economy.”

It would have been the first national railroad strike in 30 years.

In Maine, six railroads carry freight over 1,100 miles of tracks. Only New York and Pennsylvania have more track in the Northeast. The Maine trains haul a wide variety of cargo, including paper, lumber, chemicals, produce, frozen seafood, cars and appliances.

Only two of the six railroads are categorized as Class I – CSX Transportation and Canadian Pacific Railway – and neither company’s Maine branch appears to be included in the strike.

CSX purchased Pan Am Railways, the state’s largest rail operator, this summer, and Moulton believes Maine CSX employees are still working under Pan Am labor agreements. CSX could not be reached for confirmation.

The potential strike targeted American railroads, so Canadian Pacific was not included, good news for freight that runs east and west across the state.

IMPACT ON PASSENGER LINES

But the freight rail strike had already had an impact on passenger traffic. Amtrak announced Wednesday that it was suspending all long-haul routes as a result of the potential shutdown. The negotiations do not involve Amtrak employees, but the passenger railroad runs on some freight lines. On Wednesday, however, none of the lines in the Northeast was expected to be interrupted. Patricia Quinn, director of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, said Amtrak’s Downeaster service from Boston to Brunswick probably wouldn’t be affected.

But that doesn’t mean that Maine would have been untouched by a strike. The projected impact on the national supply chain would be mirrored here, Moulton said.

A strike would bring the country’s freight rail system, which carries nearly 30 percent of the nation’s cargo, to an abrupt halt. This would be a devastating blow to the still-recovering U.S. economy, with an estimated loss of $2 billion a day in economic activity. A strike also could cripple the struggling supply chain.

The Association of American Railroads has said there’s no way that the trucking industry, which is already short of drivers, would be able to pick up the slack if the trains stop running. An estimated 467,000 additional trucks a day would be needed to handle all the goods and materials.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a letter to congressional leadership on Monday that a shutdown of the rail service would have “enormous national consequences,” CNN reported.

‘ENORMOUS NATIONAL CONSEQUENCES’

“It would lead to perishable foods such dairy, fruits and vegetables spoiling at their points of origin, would halt Amtrak service for approximately 12.2 million daily riders in 46 states, would disrupt materials and goods being delivered to factories and ports, and would inhibit the transport of heating fuel and other important fuels and chemicals. These are only a few examples of the damage of a rail shutdown,” Neil L. Bradley, chamber executive vice president and chief policy officer, said in the letter.

Tom Brown, president of the Maine Automobile Dealers Association said before the agreement that it’s “very likely” that there will be some disruption, but that it remains to be seen how much. Nearly all new vehicles that are transported more than a few hundred miles from the factory to their destination are shipped by rail.

Retailers were already feeling the effects of a possible strike, as the uncertainty caused some freight carriers to limit services. The impact would have been particularly widespread as many retailers prepare for the busy holiday shipping season. L.L. Bean Inc., however, was optimistic, saying it relies only minimally on rail transportation.

What a strike would have meant for gas and energy prices is unclear, but roughly 300,000 barrels of crude oil move by rail each day and about 5 million barrels of propane are moved each month, The Associated Press reported. And roughly 70 percent of U.S. ethanol, used in gasoline, is shipped by rail.

Charlie Summers, president of the Maine Energy Marketers Association, said it’s too soon to speculate on what the impact would be in the state, but he’s “hoping that they’ll be able to work something out and hope that cooler heads prevail.”

A strike could actually have had a positive impact for Icelandic shipping company Eimskip, whose freighters dock in Portland.

“We move little if any intermodal via rail,” Andre Haines, executive vice president, said in an email. He explained that most of the freighters’ cargo hand-offs are with trucks. “The potential strikes will, I’m sure, drive more business to our service, especially for customers importing or exporting to and from the New England area and possibly further afield.”",Q3
https://www.kunm.org/local-news/2022-08-12/training-helps-law-enforcement-identify-human-trafficking-victims,Training helps law enforcement identify human trafficking victims,"People caught in human trafficking often go unseen by authorities, especially if they’re afraid to seek help. That’s why a new training program is helping law enforcement recognize the signs of trafficking and understand effective ways to intervene. KUNM spoke with U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) about how these training programs could help missing and murdered Indigenous women and relatives as well.

LEGER FERNANDEZ: We were actually approached by both the chief of police for Santa Fe and the chief of police for Albuquerque. So you know, when you've been asked by the law enforcement that this is a need. We're able to bring federal resources of training around human trafficking to our law enforcement, as well as our tribes, and different nonprofits that specialize in this area.

KUNM: How big of a problem is human trafficking here in the state of New Mexico?

LEGER FERNANDEZ: In 2020, the AG reported about 100 cases and that's just in one year. The other thing we know is that’s an under-reporting. There are so many more cases that go undetected, as we pointed out. We have victims hidden in plain sight and so that's why it's really important for our first responders, our law enforcement, our nurses, our teachers to be able to identify what are some of the signs. If you become aware of it, then you can look for that, you can look for the signs. The more we are aware of this incredibly tragic crime, then the more we are able to prosecute. When we're able to prosecute, we both cut down and we put those who are responsible for human trafficking behind bars. But another really important piece is we want to make sure that these victims of human trafficking become survivors.

KUNM: You mentioned earlier that you wanted to get tribal entities involved and focus on missing and murdered Indigenous women. How will these trainings help fight that issue?

LEGER FERNANDEZ: The victims are often the most vulnerable among us. So that includes Native American women, that includes immigrant women, that includes women who are living in poverty or living in fear. We're also bringing awareness to the Federal Law Enforcement Training officers about missing and murdered Indigenous women and what other trainings should we be developing for our first responders in Indian country and so that's been nice, something that's come out of this that we didn't anticipate at the beginning. The Federal Law Enforcement Training officers, they want to do a good job, they want to bring information and bring training to first responders that they can use. So they have the right intention. They just might not have been as aware of the needs in Indian country. Now they become more aware of those needs and have specific training that they might develop to assist Indian country.

KUNM: This program is for police officers and first responders at the moment, but there is an effort to potentially train hotel or gas station workers, right?

LEGER FERNANDEZ: I want to expand it so that we have those people who are most likely to encounter survivors or victims, so that they can say, ""Oh, wait a minute, maybe I should alert somebody."" We know, that could be hospital workers, people within the school system, people in the social services areas. We want to identify the different areas, and where victims are likely to intersect, so that we become aware of it.

KUNM: What are some of the challenges that this program faces?

LEGER FERNANDEZ: There's always a funding issue and so one of the things that we passed in the National Defense Authorization Act was additional funding that would be available to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to be able to offer this kind of training. And then it's resources, time, right, we need to be able to identify the time that people can dedicate to get this training. But I think in general, there is a desire to see it because people want to get this information.

KUNM: There's been a problem in the past with victims, especially sex workers being criminalized instead of being recognized as trafficking victims. How can this program help overcome that problem with law enforcement?

LEGER FERNANDEZ: I think it's important to recognize that when an individual is being trafficked, we need to not blame that individual. We should not criminalize what that individual is being forced to do. For example, if there is issues around prostitution, and I think that having this training opens the eyes to the first responders, to the law enforcement. That these are truly victims

The Supreme Court Struck Down New York State's Concealed Carry Law

Two men in New York took their case to the highest court in the United States after being denied concealed carry permits.

Robert Nash and Brandon Koch each applied for a concealed-carry firearm license for the purpose of self-defense. The licensing officer denied both applications, finding that neither individual met the proper cause standard required by New York law in order to issue a firearms license for general self-defense. New York courts have defined proper cause as requiring the applicant to “demonstrate a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community.

The Rensselaer County men had initially taken their case to lower courts but did not receive favorable rulings. The men claim that under New York State law, their Second Amendment rights were violated. Nash and Kock appealed to the Supreme Court on December 17, 2020. The Supreme Court ruled in their favor.

Highlights Of New York State's New Gun Laws

Increasing the Age to Purchase Semiautomatic Rifles

Legislation S.9458/A.10503 requires individuals to obtain a license prior to purchasing a semiautomatic rifle. Under preexisting New York State law, individuals must be 21 years or older to acquire a gun license.

Improving the Strength of Red Flag Laws

Legislation S.9113-A/A.10502 expands who may file an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) petition to include health care practitioners who have examined an individual within the last six months.

Microstamping Ammunition

Legislation S.4116-A/A.7926-A requires the Division of Criminal Justice Services to certify or decline to certify that microstamping-enabled pistols are technologically viable and if certified as viable, to establish programs and processes for the implementation of such technology; and establishes the crime of the unlawful sale of a non-microstamping-enabled firearm.

Closing Loopholes & Defining 'Firearms'

Legislation S.9456/A.10504 expands the definition of a ""firearm"" to include any weapon not defined in the Penal Law that is designed or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by action of an explosive. This is intended to capture firearms that have been modified to be shot from an arm brace, which are evading our current definitions of firearms and rifles.

Social Media Content Regulation

Legislation S.9465/A.10501 creates a new Task Force on Social Media and Violent Extremism. Housed in the Office of the Attorney General, the Task Force will study and investigate the role of social media companies in promoting and facilitating violent extremism and domestic terrorism online.

https://mynorthwest.com/3551278/fire-lookout-museum-is-a-priceless-northwest-treasure/,Fire Lookout Museum is a priceless Northwest treasure,"Wildfire season is here, and though – knock on tinder-dry wood – the Puget Sound area has not yet seen the flames and smoke of previous summers, there’s no question that conditions could shift at any moment, as they have so many times over the decades.

This past Saturday was the first annual “National Wildland Firefighter Day” – a commemoration created by the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho to honor the men and women who battle wildfires. It was also a perfect day to visit the Fire Lookout Museum in Spokane.

At their peak in the 1940s during World War II, there were something like 8,000 fire lookout towers in the United States – including 682 here in Washington – usually staffed with one or sometimes two people keeping their eyes open for the first sign of a fire (or, during the war, of enemy aircraft). With changes in technology and the economics of public land management, there are just a few dozen lookouts left in Washington nowadays, and only some are still staffed.

One lookout tower that remains is in a backyard in Spokane behind the home of an author, historian, and retired firefighter named Ray Kresek.

Kresek pieced the lookout together in the early 1980s from the ruins of seven separate lookout towers, not long after the time when the US Forest Service and other land managers were demolishing or burning down old lookouts which were increasingly deemed obsolete and were thought to pose a risk to curious hikers. Right after he built it, Kresek trucked his lookout around to a couple of big county fairs in Washington and Oregon. It was a popular attraction that drew more than a million visitors, and it was great place from which to sell copies of Kresek’s book, the definitive bible of regional lookout tower history, Fire Lookouts of the Northwest. That book, by the way, is out of print, hard to find, and – when it can be found – expensive (selling online for as much as hundreds of dollars).

The tower and a separate building and a huge collection of artifacts are part of the Fire Lookout Museum, which Kresek founded and incorporated as a non-profit organization. The museum is, literally, in Kresek’s backyard in suburban Spokane. It’s not really open to the public so much anymore, but journalists, history buffs and other wildfire enthusiasts are sometimes able to contact Ray Kresek via the museum’s website and score an invitation to visit.

Along with the tower and the building, Kresek’s yard is filled with old signs, fire-fighting tools and gear, and all kinds of amazing artifacts related to wildfires, Smokey Bear, the Forest Service and state forest agencies in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.

As Kresek led a tour, one of the first stops was an old outdoor phone. Fire lookouts predate radio, but the firewatchers needed to be able to communicate with each other when they saw something. Thus, in the early 20th century, foresters strung miles and miles of wire through the woods to connect lookout towers via what amounts to a rudimentary “party line,” where everyone connected to the system could listen to every call.

“This is a typical field phone along the trails back as early as 1910,” Kresek said, lifting the receiver and turning a crank. “And it still works. The old phone system [required a distinctive ring to identify individual users, so] if your call was one ‘long’ and three ‘shorts’” – at this point, Kresek stopped speaking and cranked the phone to make the bell sound one long ring, followed by three short rings – “You answered it . . . and 18 other people would listen.”

From where the phone is mounted on a pole, it’s a short climb up a staircase to the lookout, officially a model L-6, designed in the 1930s, measuring eight-feet square, with windows all around, and a “fire finder” mounted in the center of the floor. Fire finders are at the heart of the entire premise of a lookout tower and its reason to be: to help accurately pinpoint the location of smoke and fires. It’s about the size and shape of a big pizza pan, and it has map attached.

At the Fire Lookout Museum in Spokane, founder Ray Kresek demonstrates the fire finder on display in the on-site lookout tower.

“You look through this tiny little slit here,” Kresek said. “And at the other end is a horsehair, and the middle of the map is you” – where the lookout tower is located. “So, as you’re sighting the smoke that’s going to be between here and here somewhere, it’s up to you to determine the location of it.”

“That’s how fire finder works,” Kresek continued. “It’s 360 degrees of a compass, and when you report to the dispatcher, you report your azimuth, which is degrees of the compass, and an estimated distance, how far it is away from you, which, which hill it’s on, how many hills away from you.”

“And if there’s another lookout [who can also see the smoke or fire], you’re fortunate because you can do a cross shot” to triangulate and even more accurately determine the location of the distant smoke or flame.

Why does Ray Kresek care enough about lookout tower history to host a museum in his backyard for going on 40 years?

Kresek is now 85 years old. He was born in Olympia, and retired decades ago after a long career with the Spokane Fire Department. When he was a kid, his dad drove all over the state installing and repairing two-way radios in fire lookout towers, and young Ray often went along for the ride. When he was 12, he and a friend built a trail and a campground in the woods, and the Forest Service sent him a Smokey Bear poster as a thank-you – which was something of a watershed moment for the young future firefighter and museum founder.

Simply put, fascination with all things wildfire and wildfire fighting goes way back for Ray Kresek.

“I started on a lookout when I was 16 and it kind of grew with me,” Kresek said. “But I wanted to fight fire all my life, so I did that for 35 years. And then, when I retired out of the Spokane Fire Department, I went back up on a lookout for a year.”

“It’s just been in my blood all my life,” Kresek continued. “I guess it’s just one of those things, you know, you say ‘Once a lookout, always a lookout,’ and other people say, ‘You see one lookout, you’ve seen ‘em all.”

Though he is 85, Ray Kresek has no immediate plans to slow down. However, to his credit, he does have a succession plan in place so that the work of the Fire Lookout Museum will continue once he does decide to retire from what became his decades-long second fire-related career. Ultimately, the lookout tower and many related artifacts will be moved to the Priest Lake Museum not too far away in Idaho.

Carlos Landa is board president of the Priest Lake Museum. It’s clear that Landa and his fellow board members and the other volunteers at Priest Lake Museum appreciate Ray Kresek, admire his landmark book, and are thrilled the Spokane lookout tower will someday be headed their way.

Landa says that the lands around Priest Lake have a rich history of lookout towers, and the community holds a special place in Ray Kresek’s wildfire-fighting heart. He also said that under normal circumstances, moving the tower out of Kresek’s yard and trucking it over to Idaho might be expensive, but the museum’s roots – and community connections – run deep.

“We’ve still got a bunch of old boys out there,” Landa said, “and when it comes time to get something done, we’ll get it done.”

If Kresek ever gets lonely for his old lookout tower, the Priest Lake Museum folks will happily welcome him for visits. But Kresek doesn’t have to even go that far, since his son lives nearby, and also has an old lookout tower in his backyard. For the Kreseks, lookout towers are a family affair.

Along with the lookout tower and firefighting equipment, Ray Kresek also collected Smokey Bear memorabilia – it all began with that poster he got from the Forest Service when he was a kid. That led to collecting all things Smokey – including thousands of artifacts and ephemera that are believed to surpass in number and quality every other Smokey-related collection in the world, including that of the Smokey Bear Historical Park in New Mexico.

In preparation for Kresek’s eventual retirement, most of the Smokey artifacts have already been moved up to Colville, where much of it is now displayed by the Stevens County Historical Society in their Smokey Bear Room.

“He kept the things that were very special to him and things that were given to him by his family members,” said Katie Tolin, curator for the museum. “But it was considered the best Smokey collection [and while] we don’t have all of what he had, it’s still a pretty extensive collection.”

Other than a few dozen pieces still in his basement, Kresek’s Smokey materials – toys, posters, vintage costumes, souvenirs – are on display now in at the volunteer-run museum Colville, which is open every day during the summer.

In hearing Ray Kresek’s stories and learning more about the work of operating fire lookout towers, it seems that lookouts are not unlike lighthouses – remote, solitary, and isolating for the people who do long stretches of critical but solo work in those settings.

Is there something that people who are attracted to working in lookout towers have in common?

“They’re a little strange,” Kresek said, carefully – he clearly has deep respect for the profession and the people, and has an obvious love for the gear. “They’re definitely loners, because some of these lookouts, they go up on their mountain and they don’t see another soul all summer. It takes a certain type of people.”

“When I was a lookout,” Kresek continued. “I enjoyed my solitude for up to a week. After that, I wanted to see somebody because there’d be something to tell them, you know, ‘Hey, I saw a bear,’” he said, laughing.

Kresek is a treasure, whose love of wildfire history – along with that need of his to tell somebody what he saw – has made the Fire Lookout Museum he created a priceless part of the Northwest that will live on for decades to come.

The 39-year-old homeowner called police from his Seaside Park home and said a person who broke into his home around 5:15 a.m. tried to kill him, according to Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer. Arriving officers found the man with stab wounds to the arms, chest, abdomen and groin.

An investigation led police to Porfirio Serrano-Cruz, 38, of Seaside Heights who was charged with first-degree attempted murder, and second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, burglary and possession of Clonazepam without a valid prescription.

Clonazepam is a medication prescribed to control seizures or fits caused by epilepsy, involuntary muscle spasms and panic disorder, according to Webmd.com. Among its side effects in a small number of people are mood or mental changes, depression and suicidal thoughts.

Billhimer did not disclose if Serrano-Cruz removed anything from the home or if anyone else was there.

Serrano-Cruz is being held at the Ocean County Jail.

The homeowner was taken to Jersey Shore University Hospital and was in critical condition on Friday.

A look at 4th Of July parades happening in NJ for 2022 Before fireworks light New Jersey's night sky, celebrate the nation's birthday with a daytime celebration near the coast at one of New Jersey's Independence Day parades.

These are the best hiking spots in New Jersey A trip to New Jersey doesn't have to be all about the beach. Our state has some incredible trails, waterfalls, and lakes to enjoy.

From the Pine Barrens to the Appalachian Trail to the hidden gems of New Jersey, you have plenty of options for a great hike. Hiking is such a great way to spend time outdoors and enjoy nature, plus it's a great workout.

Before you go out on the trails and explore some of our listeners' suggestions, I have some tips on hiking etiquette from the American Hiking Society.

If you are going downhill and run into an uphill hiker, step to the side and give the uphill hiker space. A hiker going uphill has the right of way unless they stop to catch their breath.

Always stay on the trail, you may see side paths, unless they are marked as an official trail, steer clear of them. By going off-trail you may cause damage to the ecosystems around the trail, the plants, and wildlife that live there.

You also do not want to disturb the wildlife you encounter, just keep your distance from the wildlife and continue hiking.

Bicyclists should yield to hikers and horses. Hikers should also yield to horses, but I’m not sure how many horses you will encounter on the trails in New Jersey. If you are thinking of bringing your dog on your hike, they should be leashed, and make sure to clean up all pet waste.

Lastly, be mindful of the weather, if the trail is too muddy, it's probably best to save your hike for another day.

Advocacy groups have pressed for strong action, such as a declaration of a public health emergency and leasing federal property to abortion providers, since the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Biden has resisted such moves.

“This is a moment – the moment – the moment to restore the rights that have been taken away from us and the moment to protect our nation from an extremist agenda,” Biden said in the White House Roosevelt Room before signing an executive order that outlines the steps his administration will take.

Biden's order instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to protect and expand access to abortion care, including access to medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for over 20 years.

The order tasks the department with expanding access to reproductive health services, including family planning and providers, emergency contraception and long-acting reversible contraception such as intrauterine devices, according to a fact sheet distributed by the White House.

The administration promised to increase outreach and public education on abortion and to ensure the safety of patients and providers, including mobile clinics sent to borders to provide care for out-of-state patients.

An advocacy group pushing to restore and sustain public insurance said Biden's actions don't go far enough.

""We are glad to see the White House start to implement a whole of government approach to abortion access, but this plan, which the White House committed to months ago, is both late and not enough,"" said Morgan Hopkins, interim executive director of campaigns and strategies at All* Above All.

Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, praised Biden’s order as a “really strong next step"" but said she wants to see what specific actions the administration is going to take.

'THIS IS NOT OVER':Harris warns Supreme Court may target gay marriage, contraception next

Biden called for the creation of a task force on access to reproductive health care and sought to provide protection to women who travel across state lines to access clinical abortion services.

The attorney general's office was instructed to give assistance to states that offer legal protection to out-of-state patients and health care providers. The attorney general and the White House counsel's office will convene private attorneys that offer free legal services, as well as bar associations and public interest groups, to encourage legal representation to patients, providers and other groups that provide reproductive services.

Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the decision in 1973 that established a constitutional right to abortion.

Friday, Biden cast last month's ruling as a throwback to the 1800s when women didn't even have the right to vote. His voice rising, Biden said a 10-year-old girl in Ohio got pregnant as the result of a rape and was forced to travel to Indiana to get an abortion.

“A 10-year-old girl should be forced to give birth to a rapist's child?"" he asked. ""I can't think of anything that is much more extreme.""

Biden called again for Congress to overturn the decision by writing Roe v. Wade into federal law. He said he supports changing filibuster rules in the Senate to make it easier to codify the right to abortion and privacy into federal law.

Sixty votes are needed in the Senate to pass most legislation because of the filibuster. Changing the rules would allow senators to write Roe v. Wade into law with a simple majority. Getting rid of the filibuster is up to the Senate, and there aren’t enough votes to make that happen.

The fastest way to overturn the ruling, Biden said, is to pass a law to protect abortion rights.

“For God’s sake, there’s an election in November,” he said. “Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!”

BEYOND ABORTION:Ruling overturning Roe v. Wade sparks debate about Supreme Court's legitimacy amid partisan passions

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said federal officials are working to increase access to medication abortion in limited circumstances, ensure providers have appropriate training and resources and direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to take legal steps to protect family planning care.

Biden's order instructs Becerra to submit a report in 30 days on protecting access to abortion medication and contraception and ensuring that women have access to emergency medical care.

Fatima Goss Graves, president and chief executive officer of the National Women's Law Center, lauded Biden for taking steps to protect access to reproductive services but warned that “speed and intensity” are demanded to get people the care they need.

“Undoing these injustices will take efforts by all of us, including using the full force of the federal government,” she said.

Hopkins, of All* Above All, said more women are denied reproductive care every day as a result of the Supreme Court ruling.

""The ripple effects of the Supreme Court decision will spare no one – and the harm will fall hardest on people of color working to make ends meet,"" she said. ""President Biden must do more.""

March for Life, which opposes abortion, criticized Biden for issuing the order.

""It is tragic that this administration is using its power to push for more and more painful abortions which harm women and take innocent lives,"" said the group's president, Jeanne Mancini. ""Our nation today faces significant challenges, not enough abortion is not one of them.""

California firefighters are working to contain a route Fire that started on Wednesday near Castaic Lake. So far, approximately 27% of the fire has been contained, and evacuation orders were lifted Thursday evening. No fatalities have been reported at this time, but reportedly seven firefighters are being treated for injuries sustained from battling the blaze.

Hundreds of firefighters are taking part in the effort, assisted by 11 aircraft, according to officials. If winds increase to 30-40 mph firefighter officials warn that it could increase the strength of the brush fire.

""The fire behavior and what you saw yesterday should be a wake-up call to us all about the potential that we're in, and we're entering into over the next few days in terms of the fire conditions, very rapid fire growth, and very, very explosive fire behavior,"" said Los Angeles National Forest Chief Robert Garcia on Friday.

OREGON GOVERNOR DECLARES STATEWIDE EMERGENCY AS WILDFIRE SPREADS

Meanwhile, in San Diego County, the Border 32 Fire began only a couple of hours after the Castaic fire and has destroyed 4,438 acres. Firefighters have continued 14% of the blaze so far, according to the California Department of Forest and Fire Protection.

In the Route Fire in LA, firefighters dealt with the blaze in the midst of 111-degree heat as the Golden State prepares for one of the hottest heat waves on record. The heat forced firefighters to pull back some of their resources in order to minimize heat-related injuries.

Those who were injured were treated and released on Thursday. Crews instead deal with the fire from the air rather than on the ground during that period.

Currently, the Route Fire has engulfed two buildings and threatens to destroy more than 550 additional structures. Meteorologists project the heat wave to last until next week, making it difficult for firefighters to contain the blazes.

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Abortion rights supporters on Thursday said Indiana’s new abortion ban will be their number one target in November.

The new law took effect at midnight after a judge declined to put it on hold, citing an upcoming hearing on Monday. Abortion is now illegal in the state of Indiana except in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities, or to prevent the death of or serious physical injury to the mother. The rape and incest exceptions expire 10 weeks into the pregnancy while the fatal fetal abnormalities exception runs out at 20 weeks or once the fetus becomes viable, whichever happens first.

Ken Falk, the ACLU of Indiana’s legal director said the law doesn’t make clear whether the life and physical health exception also runs out at 20 weeks. He said that vagueness is one of the issues the ACLU cites in its ongoing lawsuit.

“This is a sorry day for people in Indiana,” he said. “Abortion and the need to get an abortion is a health care right and people are going to suffer.”

Opponents of abortion hailed the law’s entry into force. Indiana Right to Life CEO Mike Fichter in a statement called the law a new opportunity.

“This historic moment is not about who wins and who loses, or about mere politics and court battles, but about a fresh new hope that a movement of the heart will unfold in Indiana that sets the pace for protecting life and providing the care and support pregnant mothers deserve,” he said.

The law prohibits abortions from being carried out anywhere other than at a hospital or an ambulatory surgical center affiliated with a hospital. This means Indiana’s abortion clinics can no longer provide the service. Seven such clinics performed more than 98 percent of all abortions statewide last year.

Planned Parenthood’s website shows its Indiana clinics still provide other services such as emergency contraception, abortion referrals, and women’s health exams. A spokesperson for Women’s Med said that group’s Indianapolis clinic is still providing post-operative care for existing patients, but performs no other services. Women’s Med said for now, Indiana patients will be referred to its clinic in Dayton, Ohio. A judge on Wednesday put that state’s abortion ban on hold pending further litigation.

Democrats called the new law an attack on women’s rights of the kind usually seen in authoritarian countries. In a news conference featuring several Democratic candidates for office, they said the abortion ban comes up more frequently in their interactions with voters than any other issue, including the economy.

“You can hold Republicans accountable for saying our little girls should be forced to give birth,” new Marion County Democratic Party Chair Myla Eldridge said. “You can hold Republicans accountable for saying women should sacrifice their lives during birth.”

News 8 contacted the offices of Reps. Wendy McNamara, R-Evansville, and Joanna King, R-Middlebury, who sponsored the bill during its time in the Indiana House. McNamara did not respond to a request for comment while King’s office said she would not comment due to pending litigation surrounding the new law. National Right to Life legal counsel Jim Bopp, who is based in Terre Haute, said he would defer any comments to Fichter, who did not respond to a request for further comment.",Q3
https://apnews.com/e7e37e38588945599d5f723ea08b8f07,"Police: Teen saw father shoot, kill mother in California","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Southern California teenager killed this week alongside her father in a shootout with law enforcement was with him a day earlier when he fatally shot her mother, police said Thursday.

Savannah Graziano, 15, was in the back of her father’s pickup truck when he gunned down her mother, Tracy Martinez, on Monday, according to Fontana police. Witnesses and two videos — one from a bystander and another from a doorbell — show she stayed still as her mother screamed.

“She’s just sitting in the backseat,” Sgt. Christian Surgent said in a phone interview Thursday.

Authorities had previously said the teen was somewhere else during her mother’s killing and was later abducted by her father, Anthony Graziano. But the two videos obtained Wednesday showed her inside the truck between 30 and 60 seconds before the gunfire began, police said.

Witnesses did not report seeing Savannah get out of the vehicle, Surgent said, as Martinez tried to escape and Graziano — her estranged husband — jumped out wielding a handgun.

Graziano, 45, shot Martinez multiple times and also turned and fired on a nearby car. No one else was hurt.

Martinez was able to identify her killer as Graziano before she died, Surgent said, but never mentioned her daughter being there. Neither video showed the shooting.

Savannah and her father were both killed a day later after a long chase along an desert interstate east of Los Angeles in Hesperia — about 35 miles (56.33 kilometers) north of the homicide scene. Rifle shots were fired at the pursuing officers from Graziano’s pickup truck, which became disabled after driving off the highway. The shooter put several rounds through a patrol car’s windshield and later disabled a second pursuing vehicle, authorities said.

Graziano died in the truck while Savannah, wearing tactical gear and a helmet, was fatally shot as she ran toward deputies amid a hail of gunfire. Authorities are investigating whether she was shot by deputies, her father, or both.

The California Department of Justice is reviewing the teen’s death under a state law requiring the agency to investigate police shootings involving the death of unarmed civilians. Meanwhile, detectives in Fontana still have not determined a motive for the slaying.

Investigators later searched the family’s Fontana home — which Graziano and his daughter moved out of weeks prior — and Graziano’s storage unit. Inside the storage pod they found numerous AR-15-style rifles, handguns, thousands of rounds of ammunition, smoke grenades and other tactical gear, Surgent said.

The firearms were legally owned by Graziano, who was not or probation or parole. Savannah’s younger brother told investigators that the siblings grew up around guns.

Authorities have said they have police video showing the freeway shootout but have not made that public, nor did they release the two videos showing Savannah in the pickup truck just before her mother was killed.",Q3
https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2022/09/the_woman_king_movie_exposes_an_ugly_subtext_about_reparations_claims.html,The Woman King movie exposes an ugly subtext about reparations claims,"The Woman King is a new movie from Hollywood that helps to bring a little history to the same audience that ate up Disney's Black Panther. However, as even some Blacks are realizing, the Dahomey tribe that is central to the movie had significant responsibility for perpetuating the African slave trade. At some point, though, American Blacks are going to have to grapple with why no one has seen fit to blame the Africans Blacks and Muslim slave traders.

The African slave trade, by which we mean the pipeline of slaves from Africa to Europe, lasted for 500 or so years, from the 1400s through 1900. Within Africa itself, Black Africans kidnapped approximately 20,000,000 fellow Black Africans and delivered them to Muslim traders, who, in turn, sold them to Europeans, who used them in South America, the Caribbean, and North America.

More specifically, when it comes to North and South America, a trade that lasted from 1525 through 1866, 12.5 million Africans were sent overseas, only 388,000 of whom ended up in what came to be the United States — with most of them arriving when North America was still a British colony. North America was not a major player. That doesn't make what happened in North America moral; it simply puts it in perspective compared to the total slave trade from Africa to Spanish, British, French, Dutch, and other European colonies.



Image: Bringing captive slaves to market in Africa. Public domain.

Africa's involvement in the trade was essential. Europeans referred to Africa as the Dark Continent — not because its inhabitants had dark skin, but because, before the mid-19th century, they had never penetrated the interior. It was a dark continent as in an ""unknown"" continent. If African tribes hadn't kidnapped their enemies and passed them along to Muslim slave traders, there would have been no Muslim slave trade.

CNN learned this reality when Don Lemon recently spoke with Hilary Fordwich, who, to his surprise, enthusiastically agreed with his suggestion that people who benefited from colonialism (i.e., in Lemon's mind, the royal family and Europeans) should pay reparations. He was less pleased when Fordwich explained that the root cause of slavery was the Africans who sold out their own people. You really must watch the video to get a sense of Lemon's stone-faced shock, which was so profound that he couldn't even argue with her.

That's one video, though. American Blacks are getting a better lesson about their forebears' role in the slave experience because of The Woman King, about the group of female soldiers guarding the Dahomey king in the early 19th century. What's fascinating is that it's not just White conservatives pointing out the Dahomey kingdom's prominent role in the slave trade, or the fact that these female warriors were complicit in raiding other tribes to kidnap or torture to death anyone who survived a successful assault. Just look at who has signed on to the #BoycottWomanKing hashtag. (Note: ADOS stands for American Descendants of Slavery.)

I cannot applaud enough this historical honesty. But you won't see it generally from the left, and therein lies a core element of leftist racism. Naturally, leftists attack Whites because they want to bring down the Western capitalist system to replace it with socialism, and they'll use any means possible to achieve that goal.

However, their unwillingness even to touch upon African and Muslim responsibility for the slave trade speaks to something deeper: they do not believe that anyone should expect from the 16th-, 17th-, and 18th-century Africans and Muslims the same moral awareness and obligations they impose upon Europeans from the same time period. The Europeans back then should have known better; the others, well, not so much.

This division in moral responsibility can be seen either as a high compliment to the White Europeans and Americans, whom the leftists so despise, or as a deep insult to the Blacks and Muslims whom the leftists identify as both victims and leftist brothers in the war against the West. I view it as the latter, and I sure would like to see more Blacks and Muslims get offended that their ancestors are considered morally inferior to Western Europeans.",Q3
https://www.kuer.org/education/2022-09-19/utah-authors-librarians-and-teachers-call-for-more-open-minds-rather-than-more-banned-books,"Utah authors, librarians and teachers call for more open minds rather than more banned books","It’s Banned Books Week and Utah authors, librarians and academics are speaking out against efforts to remove certain books from library shelves.

Last week, the American Library Association reported that the number of attempts in 2022 to ban or restrict library resources is on track to beat the previous year’s record. Between the start of 2022 and Aug. 31, the association documented 681 attempts to ban or restrict library materials nationwide. Most of these attempts targeted multiple books.

During all of 2021, the association reported 729 attempts. And that pattern is reflected in Utah.

“So what we’re seeing…is these huge requests of lists with hundreds of titles that people — parents’ rights groups — are demanding to be removed from libraries,” Salt Lake County assistant branch manager Katie Wegner said during a panel about book banning put on by the University of Utah library.

In August, the Alpine School District pulled 52 books from its shelves after it received complaints. The group PEN America , a literary organization that advocates for freedom of expression, called the move “worrisome” and noted that 42% of the books featured LGBTQ+ characters or themes.

Martha Harris / KUER From left, Catherine Bates, Lauren Liang, Katie Wegner, and Richard Price answer questions during a panel discussion on censorship at the University of Utah J. Willard Marriott Library, Monday, Sept. 19, 2022.

University of Utah Associate Professor of Educational Psychology Lauren Liang said she has seen these book challenges happening more in recent years, in Utah and nationwide. She said during the panel that she spoke with a high school teacher last week who was in tears because a book in her classroom was challenged and she did not know what to do.

Book challenges frequently come from concerned parent groups, like the conservative Utah Parents United. The group’s website has a page with instructions for how parents can find out if there is “sexually explicit” material in their children’s school and then report it.

Utah Parents United did not respond to KUER’s request for comment.

Another panelist, Weber State University associate professor of political science Richard Price, said while some parents groups have expressed concerns about what they say is porn in their kid’s school libraries, Price said school libraries do not contain porn.

“For them [Utah Parents United], any depiction of sex is treated as porn and thus has to be excluded from the schools, from public libraries,” Price said. “But when you look at what actually gets challenged in schools, some of it has sex in it and some of it just has queer people.”

One book that has been challenged nationally is “Drama” by Raina Telgemeier. Price said the graphic novel does not include anything sexually explicit but does feature two boys kissing.

One question raised during the panel was why the focus on censoring books if kids can turn to the internet and social media for explicit material?

Liang thinks it is because it’s easier to control the materials used in schools than it is to control the internet.

“Books are highly, highly empathetic stories,” said Utah young adult author Shannon Hale. “When you read a book, you gain empathy for the characters in the book, unlike any other kind of storytelling other than knowing a person face-to-face and hearing their story in person.”

Hale said there are neighborhoods in Utah where kids may have never personally met someone who is not white, but when a kid reads a book about a person of color, they can see that person’s humanity.

Hale thinks some parents are scared of their kids empathizing with certain groups of people, and that censoring certain books will keep current power structures in place.

“And I think there are people who are afraid of their kids and teens empathizing with people that they kind of don't want to think about or wish that didn't exist,” Hale said.

Hale points to books about people of color or the LGBTQ+ community. Every year, the American Library Association compiles a list of the top 10 most challenged books and in 2021, half of those books included LGBTQ+ characters and themes.

She said books do two things really well: they help you develop empathy for people different from you and validate who you are. So when books are banned, Hale said it harms kids not traditionally represented in stories.

Hale has privately written letters to her local libraries and kids’ schools to voice her support for kids having access to diverse books. But she recently authored an open letter that was signed by 40 Utah authors. Hale said she wanted to publically voice her opposition to censorship because of the high rate of suicide for Utah teenagers. In 2020 in Utah, suicide is the leading cause of death for 10-24 year olds, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.

“Attempts to ban books about underrepresented kids sends them the message: you shouldn’t exist, your story doesn’t matter, and we don’t want our kids to empathize with you,” the letter reads. “More than ever, they need us to show them unequivocally: you matter, we love you, and we want you here. All of you.”

If parents have concerns about what books are in their kid’s school library, Hale said they should approach the issue with curiosity rather than fear.",Q3
https://www.recordonline.com/story/news/2022/07/28/current-and-former-middletown-school-employees-of-color-sue-district/65384492007/,Current and former Middletown school administrators file racial discrimination lawsuit against district,"MIDDLETOWN − One current and two former Middletown school district administrators of color are suing the district and Superintendent Amy Creeden over alleged racial discrimination and retaliation.

Former dean of students at Middletown High School Omar Perez, current district coordinator of mathematics Yaa Yaa Whaley-Williams and former Middletown High dean of student support services Anthony Williams filed the lawsuit through Goshen-based civil rights attorney Michael Sussman on Tuesday morning, July 26, in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

They are seeking a jury trial and hope to win compensatory damages from both the district and Creeden, and punitive damages from Creeden for her ""wanton violation of their civil and constitutional rights.""

Creeden said in an emailed statement on Tuesday evening that the district believes the complaint is “without merit and will be vigorously defended in court.”

The three all previously had publicly supported or were publicly associated with calls for more diverse hiring practices in the district and better treatment of employees of color. The lawsuit alleges the district responded to these employees' advocacy by retaliating in various ways, violating both their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech and equality. These retaliatory actions led to forced resignations, job terminations and humiliation, according to the lawsuit.

Middletown: Superintendent Richard Del Moro Resigns

Middletown: Amy Creeden named superintendent

The lawsuit

In August 2021, Perez − a tenured employee who, according to the lawsuit, had previously been praised by district leadership for the “quality of his leadership” − publicly said he was transferred out of the high school after he reported sexual misconduct by a non-instructional district employee.

His new position, an assistant principalship at the annex to the Truman Moon Elementary School, would take Perez away from the hundreds of students he worked with at the high school and place him in a school with 18 students, the lawsuit states.

During board meetings in August and September 2021, numerous members of the community showed up to support Perez and protest alleged mistreatment of district employees of color.

Co-plaintiff Yaa Yaa Whaley-Williams was among Perez’s supporters and spoke publicly about how the district creates a hostile work environment for minority educators.

Perez’s reassignment was ultimately reversed and former superintendent Richard Del Moro abruptly resigned. Despite calls from the community for a nationwide search for the next superintendent and more diverse hiring, the district named longtime district administrator Amy Creeden superintendent in March 2022.

Only days later on March 18, according to the lawsuit, Perez arrived late to a professional development session due to several work-related emergencies. He was then told to either agree to a 30-day leave of absence and acquire psychiatric clearance before returning to work, or the school board would mandate Perez to be psychiatrically evaluated, according to the suit.

Perez complied with the evaluation and was cleared to return to work, the lawsuit states, but the district eliminated the position he had held for years.

Creeden “implemented the district’s practice of retaliating against administrators who dared to speak out about the racial bias which permeates the school district as Perez had done in August 2021,” according to the lawsuit.

Perez recently accepted an assistant principal position in Yonkers, Sussman said.

Co-plaintiffs Whaley-Williams and Williams, the lawsuit alleges, were also retaliated against for their association with and support for Perez.

On July 7, according to the lawsuit, Creeden denied Whaley-Williams tenure “without any basis or cause” and offered to extend Whaley-Williams' tenure review period.

""Creeden refused to support Whaley-Williams bid for tenure because of the (her) advocacy for racial justice in the district and the strong support she and her husband (Anthony Williams) had garnered from the community for their advocacy,"" according to the lawsuit.

Only a few months after Anthony Williams received tenure and following the public comments of his wife, Whaley-Williams, regarding the treatment of employees of color in Middletown, the lawsuit alleges that Creeden and the school board stripped Anthony Williams of many of his job duties and created a new position to run counseling programs at the high school. Prior to this he had only received praise for his work in the district, the suit states.

Following this demotion, according to the lawsuit, Creeden and the board told Williams he did not have all of the necessary state certifications for his current position, the same position for which he had been tenured just months before, and required him to obtain these certifications or be fired. According to the suit, he was given an unrealistic timeframe to obtain the certifications and Williams was ultimately fired ""for a pretextual reason.""

According to Sussman, Middletown's treatment of employees of color will ultimately make it very difficult for them to hire a more diverse staff in the future.

""The record that it has is going to become well-known,"" he said. ""And then fewer young, talented administrators or teachers will make the choice to go to Middletown and go somewhere else without this track record. Not that there are that many places without it, but this is pretty blatant. In my view, it's going to make it much harder for them to recruit people and keep people and it'll signal to the broader community to what they're about.""

The Pakistani citizen, who lives in the United States, started his journey on Monday in Najaf – 180 kilometres (111 miles) south of the capital city of Baghdad – walking nearly 80km (50 miles) to reach Karbala on Thursday, the site of al-Husayn’s shrine and resting place.

Arbaeen itself will begin on Friday evening and end on Saturday evening.

“The experience was surreal … there are oceans and oceans of people here. People on crutches and wheelchairs were walking with us … women and children too,” the 35-year-old Gangjee, on his first Arbaeen in Iraq, told Al Jazeera.

The occasion is observed 40-days after Ashura – the commemoration of the death of the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson, Husayn, in the Battle of Karbala, which took place in 680 AD on the 10th day of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar.

Husayn and his small party were vastly outnumbered, and killed after a short battle against the forces of the Umayyad Caliph Yazid I.

The event is regarded as one of the foundational moments of Shia Islam.

In 2019, it was estimated that the annual pilgrimage had brought together more than 14 million people from across the world, including Iran, Lebanon, Indonesia and the US.

The journey can be strenuous.

Sara Mushtaq, a 35-year-old woman from Karachi, Pakistan, said at one point during the walk that her “feet just wouldn’t move” and described briefly collapsing on the side of the road.

“Physically it’s a pain I have never felt before, but spiritually I have never felt more alive,” Mushtaq, a henna tattoo artist, told Al Jazeera.

The journey is especially challenging during daytime, when temperatures range between 36 and 41 degrees Celsius. Together with packed crowds, reports of people fainting due to exhaustion or feeling dehydrated are not uncommon.

To facilitate zaireen (pilgrims), local volunteers, as well as foreigners, setup mawakeb (rest areas), makeshift stalls and clinics all along the roads to provide essentials such as food, water and beds.

“This one mawakeb I stayed overnight had served some 1,000 people a day. And its all for free … they don’t ask for anything in return,” Gangjee, a finance professional, said. “It is hard to fathom the scale at which this gathering is taking place.”

‘Searching for inspiration’

According to Mehdi Hazari – a Shia religious scholar and the head of education and research at the Imam Mahdi Association of the Marjaeya (IMAM) in the United States – a major reason for the non-obligatory pilgrimage is “searching for “inspiration in this world for which Imam Husayn died for”.

“In this world where there is so much noise … things are happening everywhere. Today we can hear about one event in one part of the world to the next with the press of a button our phone. It creates a blindness of sort … we have become complacent,” he said from North Carolina.

“So the walk … is where a person can find their heart awakened … meaning there is this sense overwhelming sense of giving, of sharing without asking for anything in return that creates this humanity, a type of brotherly and sisterly love.”

Echoing Hazari’s sentiments, Mushtaq said that the trip had completely broken her down “physically, mentally and spiritually” and that she now had the chance to rebuild herself.

“What I hope to gain is to take this feeling with me back to reality. Here people see the best version of you. When you go home, this feeling will last a week, a month maybe?” she said.

“I want to incorporate this experience into my daily life … and teach my kids what it really means to be a lover of Husayn.”

Pandemic, political instability

This year is the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020 that Arbaeen will take place without restrictions or a cap on foreign travellers.

Last year, Iraqi authorities limited the number of foreign travellers to 40,000 people, with 30,000 allowed from Iran.

There has, however, been political instability to worry about this year.

Tensions between Shia political forces led to an outbreak of violence on the streets of Baghdad at the end of August, leaving more than 30 people dead.

Some countries began urging their citizens not to travel to Iraq as a consequence.

However, for Gangjee, nothing was going to stop him.

“Sometimes you just have a calling. In the first 10 days of Muharram this year I made the decision to go … I spoke to my wife and booked my trip immediately,” Gangjee said.

“It never occurred to me after that to cancel my flight. The only way I would not go is if they didn’t allow me in.”",Q3
https://theconversation.com/how-covid-19-lockdown-measures-and-their-outcomes-varied-in-cities-around-the-world-184682,How COVID-19 lockdown measures — and their outcomes — varied in cities around the world,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese cities have repeatedly imposed lockdowns following their central government’s stubborn pursuit of Zero-COVID. But lockdowns weren’t limited to authoritarian regimes such as China. Many democracies also imposed some form of lockdowns to curb the virus transmission.

How effective were they? Was it worth it? And who was the most adversely affected?

These are meaningful questions to reflect on, especially as drastic COVID-19 measures have been lifted as the severity of the virus’s impact has waned.

We’ve been studying the disparate responses to COVID-19 undertaken by three major cities: Johannesburg, Toronto and Chicago.

We examined the nature and impact of public health measures on various populations in these cities. We found “lockdown” to be an imprecise description for the range of restrictions put in place. Lockdown meant different things in different places, but regardless of the context, they disproportionately afflicted those who are and the disadvantaged.

Johannesburg: Traumatic impact

South Africa’s hard lockdown in 2020 — lasting from March 27 to April 30 — was modelled on Wuhan’s. Strictly enforced by the announcement of a National State of Disaster, which gave government extraordinary powers, it banned all outdoor activities except for essential services. It was a blunt instrument applied uniformly across the country, although patterns of infection varied widely by region and locality.

The lockdown had a devastating impact on the economy, people’s livelihoods and food security. On May 1, 2020, South Africa introduced a five-level risk-adjusted strategy. The response remained national in scope, with the National Coronavirus Command Council issuing directives to the provincial governments, which manage health care, and local governments, which provide services in distressed communities.

The lockdown may have delayed the first wave by a month or so, but its economic impact was more traumatic than the impact of the illness. This was especially so for those who did not have the option of home-based work. There was a difference between how the lockdown was experienced by, for example, households in informal settlements and middle-class households in the suburbs.

Social disparity in South Africa, one of the world’s most unequal societies, increased throughout the pandemic. There was a shadow pandemic of violence against women, with South African police reporting a 37 per cent increase in gender-based crime. Children in poor communities lost more than a year of schooling, while those from affluent communities moved online.

Toronto: Swift and decisive

Toronto’s early response to COVID-19 was swift and decisive, but not as restrictive as in Johannesburg. Subject mostly to provincial oversight in public health management, the city closed schools and restaurants, cancelled professional sporting events and restricted most public life, leaving intact only emergency and essential services.

Throughout subsequent waves of surges, Toronto oscillated between opening up and shutting down. This gave the city a reputation of imposing lockdowns that were longer and stricter than most.

The lockdown had uneven impacts across Toronto. There were significant differences between rich and poor, office and essential workers, households saddled with caregiving responsibilities and those without.

Community responses varied across the region as the impact of the pandemic intensified in health and economic terms.

There was a visible class divide in Canada’s urban communities. Racialized and lower-income people experienced the lockdown measures as an additional, often existential, burden, while residents in higher-income households experienced temporary inconvenience.

Eventually, restrictive measures were enacted across all three levels of government. These restrictions contributed to the so-called “freedom convoy,” which occupied parts of Ottawa in protest in 2022.

Chicago: Softer measures

Comparatively, Chicago had a soft lockdown. The city issued a stay-at-home order from March 20 to April 30, 2020, but exempted many essential activities, including exercising outdoors and shopping for groceries. It closed restaurants, offices and public schools, but many resource-rich private schools remained open and offered in-person instruction.

The stay-at-home order had a devastating impact on the economy (especially the service sector) and on Black and Latino neighbourhoods, where many residents who worked in essential services lived. For higher-income households, the stay-at-home order brought some inconvenience, but many also enjoyed the benefit of working from home — a trend that continued even after the city lifted all restrictions in 2022.

Weighing the pros and cons

Our preliminary research suggests that the experience of COVID-19 should at least give authorities pause before introducing lockdowns as a blanket strategy. We accept that they were generally intended to “flatten the curve,” providing time to prepare for the anticipated waves of infection.

The COVID-19 lockdowns were understandable as a public health measure in a time of insecurity and ignorance of the emerging disease threat. But we now know that they most deeply affected the poor and other vulnerable groups, worsening social inequalities. They were often a blunt measures, relying on quickly dated information on virus transmission and implemented at geographic scales that didn’t account for how the disease spread.

The negative impacts of hard lockdowns may have exceeded their benefits. They intensified social conflict, eroded democratic practice and undermined trust in politics and governance at a time when they were most needed.

Lockdowns should be a measure of last resort but, if they are unavoidable in future pandemics, governments must consider more targeted approaches, put in place a support system to cushion the impact on vulnerable citizens and keep democratic ground rules in place.",Q3
http://www.tnledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=156864,Tennessee prosecutor: 3 fatal shootings by police justified,"VOL. 46 | NO. 34 | Friday, August 26, 2022

MEMPHIS (AP) — Police officers involved in three fatal shooting incidents in Memphis won't face criminal charges, the top prosecutor in Tennessee's most populous county said.

Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich said the shootings of fleeing felons last year were justified. The decisions were based on evidence, facts and statements in reports compiled by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. A review team that included Weirich then examined the reports, Weirich said in a news release.

In August 2021, a suspect in a narcotics investigation struck a Shelby County sheriff's lieutenant with his car. The officer fired two shots, one of which hit the suspect in the chest. A stolen pistol, marijuana, cocaine and fentanyl were found inside the car and the suspect had $1,900 in his pockets, the statement said.

Last December, a Memphis police officer shot a woman who put a stolen car in reverse at a restaurant drive-thru lane, striking another officer's police cruiser, the statement said.

And an Arkansas state trooper was cleared in the December 2021 fatal shootings of two men in a fleeing vehicle after the driver had fired multiple rounds at the trooper, hitting him in the chest. The chase ended in Memphis, the statement said.",Q3

Courtney Clenney, 26, is scheduled to appear in Hilo District Court on Thursday following her arrest in Hakalau at the Exclusive Hawaii Rehab Center on the Big Island.

According to Hawaii Island Police, who assisted US Marshals with the arrest, Clenney was arrested around 9:30 a.m. on Aug. 10. She is wanted in Florida on one count of second-degree murder.

On Thursday, Florida law enforcement officials held a press conference formally announcing the murder charge against Clenney. During the presser, officials laid out a timeline of events they say led up to the deadly stabbing.

Police say Clenney grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed her boyfriend, 27-year-old Christian Obmuseli, to death in their Miami apartment back on April 3.

Miami Police officers arrived at the scene and found the Clenney cradling Obmuseli with a stab wound to the chest. He was taken to hospital and later pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that the knife wound punctured Obmuseli’s subclavian artery. The knife penetrated about three inches at a downward angle, the report stated.

According to the arrest report, Clenney acknowledged killing Obumseli but said she acted in self-defense. She said Obumseli had pushed her and thrown her to the floor, which prompted her to grab a knife and throw it at Obumseli from about 10 feet (3 meters) away, the Associated Press reported. The medical examiner said Obumseli's wound could not have been caused by a knife thrown from that distance.

According to the AP, Clenney's Miami defense lawyer, Frank Prieto, said the medical examiner's opinions won't stand up to scientific scrutiny when they argue self-defense at trial. He acknowledged that Clenney and Obumseli had a tumultuous relationship but said Obumseli was the primary aggressor.

“Obumseli was the abuser, the worst kind of abuser,” Prieto said in a statement to the AP. “He would manipulate and abuse Courtney in private when he thought nobody was around.”

Investigators said they found evidence that the couple had been in a volatile relationship since November 2020, with multiple incidences of domestic violence from both sides over the period of their relationship – including neighbor and security complaints at their Miami apartment.

During the press conference, investigators released surveillance footage from an incident in February 2022 inside the elevator at the apartment. The couple had only moved into the apartment together in January 2022, police said.

Clenney is being held at the Hawaii Police Department's East Hawaii Detention Center.

Also in court on Thursday, Clenney waived extradition proceedings. She was denied bail and has been ordered to return to Hilo Circuit Court on Sept. 12, if she has not been extradited back to Florida by that date. A date for when she could be extradited back to Florida has not been set.

Clenney is a popular content creator on various social media platforms, including Instagram and OnlyFans, where she has amassed millions of online followers.",Q3
https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/28/gms-growth-is-about-more-than-just-electric-cars/?source=iedfolrf0000001,GM's Growth Is About More Than Just Electric Vehicles,"What do you think of America's newest defense contractor?

The Chevrolet Bolt. The Hummer EV. The Chevy Silverado EV. The Cadillac Lyriq.

For the past couple of years at least, General Motors (GM 1.00%) has been pivoting from leadership in the production of full-sized, gas-powered pickups to production of a full line of high-tech, 21st-century electric vehicles like the ones listed above. It's these efforts (and plans to spend $35 billion on the projects) that have grabbed all the attention and reports about this automotive giant.

But EVs aren't the only enterprise GM is pursuing in its efforts to revive a stock price that's barely budged in five full years. It turns out GM is also trying to get back into the defense contracting business.

GM has a history of military dealings

Once upon a time -- during WWII, to be precise -- General Motors served as one of America's foremost defense contractors. Converting 94 stateside plants to military production, GM churned out thousands of Wildcat fighter planes and Avenger torpedo bombers for the U.S. Navy, and more than 850,000 trucks, transports, and M5 ""Stuart"" light tanks for the Army. As historian A.J. Baime put it in Arsenal of Democracy, ""American soldiers were motoring into battle in GM tank destroyers, amphibious 'DUCK' trucks, and two-and-a-half-ton troop transporters, and they were firing GM-built submachine guns, bullets, and mortar shells.""

Indeed, for more than 50 years after World War II, General Motors kept on supplying the Army with everything from medium-weight trucks to light armored vehicles to ""Stryker"" armored personnel carriers -- up until it sold its defense business to General Dynamics (GD -1.71%) in 2003. And yet, after more than a decade of pacifism, GM trumpeted its return to the military biz in 2017 with a reconstituted GM Defense division.

Uncle Sam wants YOU ... to build him some trucks!

In 2020, GM Defense notched its first big victory, winning a $214.3 million contract to supply the Army with 649 Infantry Squad Vehicles ($330,200 per ISV) based on its own Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize truck design, a contract that could triple in size over time. And this week GM set its sights on an even bigger target, announcing it would team up with Germany's Rheinmetall to offer a new truck for the Army's Common Tactical Truck program, which is seeking a replacement for its ""Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles"" fleet.

According to the companies, the Army is seeking bids to produce approximately 5,700 heavy trucks for the military -- a potential $5 billion windfall for the winner. GM and Rheinmetall will bid an ""Americanized"" model based on the latter's HX3 -- the HX3-CTT -- featuring ""an advanced, interchangeable protected cab design, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and drive by wire operation [and the ability to scale in size] from 4x4 to 10x10.""

Competition and timelines

To date, GM's (and Rheinmetall's) bid is the only one I'm aware of, but the Army says it is seeking bids from at least three vendors -- so GM is not guaranteed a win here. Whether it's at least in the running to win, however, should soon be known. The Army sent out its request for prototype proposals in June, and it expects to award prototyping contracts in very short order -- by December 2022.

Then there will be a ""runoff"" in late 2023 as the Army puts the various prototypes through their paces. The Army will pick a single winner, with an official contract award and a promise of $5 billion in revenue following in 2025. The new trucks should then be ready for deployment in 2028.

Granted, even $5 billion in new revenue won't move the needle much for GM (which according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence did more than $127 billion in business last year). But even this contract could be just the start of the good news.

As The Detroit News reported in June, with one big defense contract already in the bag, and another perhaps on the way, GM Defense is ""going international"" with a plan to start marketing its military trucks first to Canada, then to Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia as well. Its partnership with Rheinmetall could help here as well -- while GM Defense has been out of the international market for a while, Rheinmetall has been very active. Indeed, the company boasts some 20 global customers already, running the whole length of the alphabet, from Austria all the way down to New Zealand.

Combined with GM's already global reach in civilian vehicles, this should be a formidable partnership, combining great economies of scale from supplying the world's biggest military buyer with established relationships to grow sales even further all around the world. That $5 billion could be only the beginning for GM.",Q3
https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/07/01/to-defend-our-rights-defend-our-democracy/,"To Defend Our Rights, Defend Our Democracy","Protesters have poured into the streets following the Supreme Court’s decision to end reproductive freedom. As a mother of three, I share this anguish and anger. I fear for our lives in a country that so easily takes away a fundamental right.

But we shouldn’t be surprised — this far-right court has been chipping away at democracy itself for years. And as Justice Clarence Thomas has made clear, the court’s newly emboldened conservatives want to take away more rights — including your right to family planning and the right to marry the person you love.

This is nothing short of a constitutional coup to impose extreme, minority views on our nation. But I still have hope. We can restore our rights if we stay disciplined and focused in our defense of democracy.

I lead People’s Action, a national coalition of grassroots groups with a vision of a multiracial democracy with room and opportunity for all.

I believe the key now isn’t just to respond to one crisis after another. When we do that, we follow the playbook of the people who are taking our rights away. Instead, we need a long-haul campaign to defend and expand our democracy — and with it, all of our fundamental rights.

When I think about strategies that win, I think about the late Congressman John Lewis. He was 20 when he led sit-ins to end racial segregation, 21 when he led Freedom Rides through the segregated South, and 25 when he marched from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights. Each time, he risked his life.

But even at his young age, Lewis was fully prepared. He stood on the shoulders of giants like Thurgood Marshall, whose legal work opened doors for the civil rights movement, and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., whom Lewis joined at the White House for the signing of the Voting Rights Act in August 1965 — just six months after he was brutally attacked by police in Selma.

I also think of Gail Cincotta, the fiery Chicago housewife who co-founded National People’s Action with organizer Shel Trapp in 1972.

Gail led and won the fight for the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which forced banks to stop refusing to lend in Black, brown, and lower-income white communities. Gail led hundreds of protests, but she and Trapp also spent many hours training organizers who went on to found grassroots groups all across the country, and to demand the CRA live up to its promises.

That’s why at my organization, we’re doubling down to train a new generation — in both rural and urban areas — to defend democracy.

Through our Organizing Revival project, we’re training thousands in the organizing fundamentals pioneered by Cincotta and Trapp, as well as new approaches like deep canvassing so organizers learn to listen and meet people where they are. Our deep canvassing played a decisive role in changing hearts and minds during the 2020 election and can do so again.

Every fight endures setbacks, because the powerful never give up easily. But if we stay grounded in love and disciplined in our organizing, we can create the hope that together, we can build a democracy that respects the rights and dignity of all people.

When the big banks sought to gut the CRA, Gail helped create a wider national coalition to defend it. Before he passed away in 2020, Congressman Lewis introduced the Freedom to Vote Act to restore the democratic rights the Supreme Court had eroded. And Democrats in Congress now plan to introduce bills to restore reproductive freedom and proactively defend other rights.

We must pass this legislation swiftly. To protect it, we will need an army of Gail Cincottas and John Lewises. Because make no mistake: This is a war, and one that will not be over soon. But if we are prepared, we will win.",Q3
https://www.pressherald.com/2022/08/31/search-finds-tea-party-patriots-gorham-gravesite/,Search finds Tea Party patriot’s Gorham gravesite,"The forgotten grave of a Boston Tea Party patriot has been found in Gorham but the site will likely remain tucked away from public view.

Ephraim Smith, a young sailor who helped dump British tea into the Boston Harbor on Dec. 16, 1773, later moved to Gorham, where he died at age 84 on a local farm in 1835, according to the “History of Gorham,” by Hugh Davis McLellan.

Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum representatives will come to Gorham Oct. 8 to place a marker on his grave in advance of the 250th anniversary of the tea party next year.

The Boston Tea Party was a political protest by American colonists against Britain for imposing taxation without representation. The patriots dumped 342 chests of tea imported by the British East India Company into the harbor.

“It will bring a very prestigious group to Gorham,” Bruce Roullard, chairman of Gorham Historic Preservation Commission, told his board Monday.

Gorham historians scrambled to find Smith’s burial site after records proved to be inaccurate.

Following an intense search, Smith’s gravestone was found last week on private property in an undisclosed location off Sebago Lake Road (Route 237). The land owner has requested anonymity, according to Gorham Historical Society President Suzanne Phillips.

Kristin Harris, research coordinator at the Boston museum, said Tuesday the property owner wants a private ceremony at the grave site. Ceremonies are usually public, with museum representatives wearing colorful, colonial outfits in events swarmed by media.

It’s unclear whether a brass tea party marker would remain permanently on Smith’s grave or placed elsewhere in town where it can be viewed by the public.

The mystery unfolded about three weeks ago when the Boston museum contacted Gorham historians, after which Roullard and Phillips set out to find Smith’s grave.

The Boston museum, Maine Old Cemetery Association and town records indicated Smith was buried in the Smith Cemetery, believed to be on Wilson Road in the White Rock section of Gorham.

Cynthia Smith, the present-day owner of the farm adjacent to the Wilson Road cemetery, but not a descendent of Ephraim Smith, escorted an American Journal reporter to the secluded site. Only three gravestones were there for a reported 75 graves, and none of them was Smith’s.

It’s unknown whether the 72 other gravestones were lost when the road was widened decades ago or when gravel was extracted from a nearby pit. A search through the underbrush and among trees in the Wilson Road cemetery yielded no evidence of Smith’s grave.

Undeterred, Roullard and Phillips dug through old documents and probed obscure cemeteries all over town and in South Windham.

Then good fortune struck. A casual conversation about the quest between Phillips and a resident revealed graves were located on the individual’s property. They proved to be those of Smith and his wife, Elizabeth, and Phillips snapped photos.

According to the Boston museum’s information, Ephraim Smith was born in 1751 in Eastham, Massachusetts, and was a resident of Wellfleet in 1773.

Smith, who was a ship’s captain after settling in Gorham around 1780, happened to be in Boston with his vessel at the time of the tea party and joined a crowd in heaving the tea overboard from British ships.

Smith’s participation was recorded in a letter published Sept. 30, 1833, in the Portland Weekly Advertiser and in the “History of Gorham Maine.” The book referred to tea as an “obnoxious weed.”

He was one of up to 150 people who acted in protest; the Boston museum has placed 101 markers on graves so far, Harris said.

The tea party is considered a prelude to the American Revolution by historians.

“It was treason,” Harris said.",Q3

ITV News Correspondent Ben Chapman reports on the significance of Kansas voting to continue to protect abortion in the state constitution

Kansas has voted to protect abortion rights in its constitution by rejecting an amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to tighten restrictions of ban abortion outright.

It is the first US state to put abortion rights to a vote since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June, the 1973 ruling that established the right to safe and legal abortion at any point before a foetus can survive outside the womb, for nearly five decades.

The vote was the first test of popular opinion since the Supreme Court's decision, and was unexpected in a deeply conservative and typically Republican state.

“This vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions,” President Joe Biden said in a statement.

After calling on Congress to “restore the protections of Roe” in federal law, Biden added, ""the American people must continue to use their voices to protect the right to women’s health care, including abortion.”

On Wednesday, the president will sign an executive order aimed at making it easier for women to travel between states to access abortions.

He will issue a directive that will allow states that have not outlawed abortion to apply for specific Medicaid waivers that would, in effect, help them treat women who have travelled from another state.

The vote provided a warning to Republicans who had celebrated the Supreme Court ruling and have been enacting abortion bans or near-bans in nearly half the states.

“Kansans bluntly rejected anti-abortion politicians’ attempts at creating a reproductive police state,” said Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity.

”Today’s vote was a powerful rebuke and a promise of the mounting resistance,"" she added.

Anti-abortion activists react after the attempt to remove abortion protections from the Kansas constitution failed on Tuesday. Credit: AP

A 'yes' vote on the ballot would have removed from the state constitution the right to an abortion and put the issue in the hands of the state lawmakers.

The 'no' vote means no changes will be made, keeping abortion rights enshrined in the state constitution.

Mallory Carroll, spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, described the vote as “a huge disappointment” for the movement and called on anti-abortion candidates to “go on the offensive.”

She added that after the Supreme Court ruling, “We must work exponentially harder to achieve and maintain protections for unborn children and their mothers.”

“This outcome is a temporary setback, and our dedicated fight to value women and babies is far from over,"" said Emily Massey, a spokesperson for the pro-amendment campaign.

Kristy Winter, a teacher, voted against the measure and brought her 16-year-old daughter with her to her polling place.

“I want her to have the same right to do what she feels is necessary, mostly in the case of rape or incest,” she said. “I want her to have the same rights my mother has had most of her life.”

Abortion advocates predicted the anti-abortion groups and lawmakers behind the ballot would push quickly for an abortion ban if voters approved it.

Before the vote, the measure’s supporters refused to say whether they would pursue a ban as they appealed to voters who supported both some restrictions and some access to abortion.

The Kansas vote is the start of what could be a long-running series of legal battles playing out where lawmakers are more conservative on abortion than governors or state courts.

Kentucky will vote in November on whether to add language similar to Kansas’ proposed amendment to its state constitution.

Meanwhile, Vermont will decide in November whether to add an abortion rights provision to its constitution. A similar question is likely headed to the November ballot in Michigan.

Which states have enacted abortion bans since Roe v Wade fell?

After the decision, clinics in some states stopped performing abortions almost immediately. Some states had unenforced laws predating 1973 that were able to come back to life immediately once the ruling was reversed.

Others had so-called trigger bans that were able to be quickly enforced.

States which have tightened restrictions or effectively banned abortion since Roe v Wade was overturned include Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Some states still offering the procedure, including Minnesota, are seeing a surge of out-of-state patients coming to their abortion clinics.

Some pro-choice states also offered women from states where abortion is now banned support to travel to a state where it is legal.",Q3

""It is going to be years and years for folks who are low income, communities of color to come out of this [pandemic],"" said Eric Guckian, United Way of the Greater Triangle's CEO and President.

Disparities are pronounced when comparing DHHS case demographic data to census population information.

Asian American and Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaskan Natives as well as people who identify as Hispanic are significantly overrepresented in the case demographic data compared to population data.

Similarly, older residents have had more cases of COVID, as well.

Census data shows that 22,767 of every 100,000 residents are 65 and older. Meanwhile, there are 41,737 people in that age group, per 100,000, who have tested positive for the virus.

Guckian, the United Way’s CEO, says combating COVID equitably and making sure each North Carolinian has the same access to resources is imperative.

""What we hope is that more people are benefiting from this and can pull out of this pandemic faster and healthier,"" he said.

The $1 million the United Way is distributing comes from federal funding. Each nonprofit group will receive $100,000 later this month and the same amount in about a year.",Q3

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s sensational defamation trial sparked a number of heated debates on the internet.

Despite the final verdict, the discussion on the trial continues to make headlines.

Recently, a bar in the United States has introduced a drink, named after the Pirates of the Caribbean star to help men who are feeling unsafe and scared.

As per the signboard, a customer in the bar can discreetly order the 'Johnny Depp shot' if they are ‘feeling unsafe or scared’.

The picture of the bar’s sign has gone viral on social media for introducing a drink to help men who might need help.

""Feeling unsafe or scared, just come to the bar and order a Johnny Depp shot,"" the sign says. The sign also lists three types of shots available - Neat, On The Rocks, and With Lime.

When a customer orders a ‘Neat Johnny Depp shot', he will get safely escorted out of the bar with an employee. The other two variants, ’On The Rocks' and ‘With Lime’ will prompt the staff to either call a cab or call the police.

Reacting to the post, one fan commented, “Absolutely amazing! Abuse is not gender related.” Another said, “This is the right step to take.”

""This is so incredible and why it's important that he stood up and we continue to spread awareness for the issues he brought to light,"" added another.

https://www.thesun.ie/travel/1518802/hoover-dam-nevada-where-is-it/,Where is the Hoover Dam and how was it built? – The Irish Sun,"DAM BIG Where is the Hoover Dam and how was it built?

HOOVER DAM is one of the largest electrical power plants in the world and is considered an engineering landmark.

Here's what you need to know about the ""greatest dam in the world"".

Where is the Hoover Dam?

Hoover Dam is situated on the Nevada-Arizona border and is 30 miles south east of Las Vegas.

The dam is ginormous, stretching 1,244 feet across the Black Canyon.

It is 726.4 feet high.

Construction began on September 30, 1930.

1 Hoover Dam is a tourist attraction in itself because of its epic size and location

Why was it built?

It was constructed to control flooding along the Colorado River and provides water and hydroelectric power for California and the south west.

It helped fuel the development of such major cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix in the 1930s and 1940s.

And it was credited with helping to jump-start America's economy after the Great Depression.

The mammoth project was spearheaded by the President of the time, Herbert Hoover.

For that reason the dam was named after him.

How was it built?

It took 30 years of planning before the construction of the Hoover Dam started.

Engineer Arthur Powell Davis, who worked at the Bureau of Reclamation, started the plans in 1902.

The construction then started in 1931 and it finally opened on March 1, 1936.

In those times, no company was strong enough to take the project on its own, so Utah Construction Company got in business with five others to fund the dam which cost them approximately $674million in today's money.

The sides of the Black Canyon were blown away with explosives creating space for construction.

Four direction tunnels were built to redirect water while the dam was being built.

It took them a year to dredge the bottom of the canyon, blast and then remove the debris, and dig to build the foundations of the dam.

Giant concrete blocks were fitted and used to build the dam.

It should be appreciated how over 5,000 workers did most of the labour by hand, mainly because the dam was built in the middle of nowhere.

The average pay for such workers was 62.5 cents an hour - the lowest being 50 cents an hour and the highest $1.25 an hour.



How many turbines are there?

There are 17 main turbines in the Hoover Power Plant.

Nine on the Arizona wing and eight on the Nevada wing.

They generate on average about 4 billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric power each year for Nevada, Arizona, and California.

Today that serves 1.3 million people.

Swimmers are banned from the reservoir because they risk being sucked under by the turbines.

But in September a stag-do Brit cheated death as the first person to swim across it.

He only escaped being dragged under during his 30-minute swim because nine of its ten hydroelectric turbines were switched off.

How much concrete was used to build it?

It is estimated some 4.3 million cubic yards of concrete were used to build the dam, its power plant and other features.

This was said to be enough concrete to pave a 16-foot-wide, 8-inch-thick road from San Francisco to New York City, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.

The concrete dam, which is curved, is 660 feet thick at its base and 45 feet thick at the top.

How many deaths were there?

Contrary to popular myth, no one was buried alive in the dam’s concrete as it was poured.

Officially the project had 96 construction-related deaths.

This resulted from falling rocks or accidents involving heavy equipment.

But it is thought the actual death toll was way in excess of 100.

Many workers were unhappy with the working conditions and in 1961, some of them went out on strike to demand iced water, flush toilets, and that the Six Companies who built the project follow mining laws.

Despite the danger and poor conditions of working at the dam, it was a job that many people moved to Nevada for in 1929, considering the poor economic state at the time.

https://www.aol.com/news/former-state-senator-reaches-ethics-210333653.html,Former state senator reaches ethics settlement related to sexual harassment allegations,"Clearwater Republican Jack Latvala, who resigned from the Florida Senate in 2017 after sexual-harassment allegations, has reached a proposed settlement involving related ethics accusations.

Latvala agreed to the proposed settlement Tuesday with Elizabeth Miller, advocate for the Florida Commission on Ethics. If the ethics commission signs off, Latvala could face a public censure and reprimand, with the matter forwarded to the Senate for further action.

In what is known as a joint stipulation and recommended order, Latvala admitted to using “poor judgment” in a consensual two-decade relationship with a female lobbyist, which “may have constituted a technical violation” of state law. The agreement said there is “no evidence that this affected his official actions in any way.”

The settlement would lead to dismissal of other allegations, “as the evidence does not warrant moving forward.”

READ MORE: ‘He unbuttoned my jacket and he felt me up.’ Lobbyist details senator’s harassment.

Latvala resigned from the Senate after the release of a special master report into allegations he had sexually harassed a Senate aide. Latvala, who was Senate budget chairman at the time, denied wrongdoing but admitted he had an extramarital affair with a former lobbyist, whose testimony prompted the special master to recommend a probe into whether Latvala had broken state laws by promising legislative favors in exchange for sex.

The report also found probable cause to support allegations that Latvala groped the Senate aide and engaged in a pattern of making unwelcome remarks about women’s bodies.

In July 2018, the Leon County state attorney’s office announced there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges related to whether Latvala promised legislative favors. The settlement Tuesday said it is unlikely evidence could establish clear and convincing proof that Latvala’s behavior violated state law.

“Respondent [Latvala] enters into this joint stipulation with the understanding of the seriousness of the violation and gives his assurance that this proceeding has affected the manner in which he conducts himself as a public official in a positive way,” the agreement said.",Q3
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/22/books-banned-libraries/,"You can ban a book, but can you stop teens from finding it online?","Aren Lau knows what it’s like to have to sneak around to read controversial books. The 17-year-old moved from Georgia in his freshman year of high school to live with his dad in New York City. He says at least two of the three books he’s currently reading would have been an issue back home.

“I know the internet exists and it’s obviously very useful for kids to access things they can’t access in school, but a lot of times kids who are in these conservative schools are also in very conservative homes,” Lau says.

Demand for many of those same titles is only growing online, as educators and librarians try to fill the void with internet-based resources. Some libraries have removed physical copies of controversial books but still offer them as digital checkouts through apps like Libby. Meanwhile, some lawmakers are going after the online technology used by libraries, hoping to block certain content.

A book about sexuality or racism might not be allowed in your school, your local library or even your own home. But online, it can be found as an e-book in another library, less legally on torrenting sites or for purchase from any online bookstore. The concepts in that book, deemed too dangerous to young minds by some legislators or parents, are freely available on educational websites and Wikipedia, recapped on social media and documented in mainstream articles.

Pulling a physical book out of a school library seems like it should be a minor roadblock when online alternatives exist. The reality is more complicated. Finding books takes work and unfiltered internet access.

“The fact is, if you’re an enterprising teenager and you want a copy of ‘Gender Queer,’ you’re going to get it,” says Linda E. Johnson, president and CEO of the Brooklyn Public Library. “Either the elected officials or parents or school administrators are naive, or there’s something else at play.”

The Brooklyn Public Library is at the center of the national battle between limiting and expanding book access for teenagers. In April, it launched its Books Unbanned program, offering free online access to its entire collection for 13-to-21-year-olds who send an email. Johnson says it has already issued more than 5,100 cards and checked out 20,000 materials as part of the program. The program is funded independently, which is why it can offer books to people out of state.

Simply pointing students to the program’s site has already created an issue for one teacher. In August, a Norman, Okla., high school English teacher was punished and then quit after posting a QR code in her classroom that linked to the Brooklyn program. The state has one of the strictest laws in the nation against teaching students about race and sex.

Like many attempts at book banning, the incident created a bit of a Streisand effect, amplifying the very thing it was trying to silence. Brooklyn’s program had a surge of applications and the QR code started showing up online and even on lawn signs in Norman. Johnson says the library can see what’s happening in different states just by the interest in its site — there are spikes in demand in districts after schools attempt to ban titles.

Not every teenager has open access to these resources or even knows they exist. And bans in schools and libraries affect students beyond being able to find individual books.

“In theory, the internet and the access that it provides gives the appearance that people can still access books. I think what is missed is there is something quite tangible and irreplaceable about a library that holds books,” says Jonathan Friedman, who directs PEN America’s free expression and education program. “The whole idea of a school library is to encourage literacy and exploration and access to information.”

For five decades, the book “Our Bodies, Ourselves” was battling bans in schools and libraries. The educational book about women’s sexuality and health was simultaneously labeled obscene and used by women to get the kind of information they weren’t able to find elsewhere about everything from puberty to rape.

It ceased publication in 2018 but was relaunched in September as a fully online resource focused on health, sexuality and reproductive justice. Its history of being banned was one of the reasons organizers were eager to make a site that was free and open to anyone on the internet, says Amy Agigian, its executive director and a sociology professor at Suffolk University in Boston.

“I believe having information online is absolutely helpful to people who are seeking things that are being banned,” Agigian says. “But there’s so much that a library can offer that the internet can’t make up for.”

Banned Books Week is an annual event to raise awareness about books that are banned or challenged. Local libraries usually put out books that have been banned in the past and host events.

“It was kind of quaint for a while, every library had a display,” says Johnson, the Brooklyn Public Library head.

This year, libraries and organizations including PEN America, the American Library Association and the National Coalition Against Censorship are hoping to inspire more activism and greater pushback against the organized attempts to block teens’ access to books — even from the teens themselves.

“There is an effort to really change the way in which the access to info is really available to the country as a whole,” PEN America’s Friedman says. “And in many places, students are a little bit freer right now to speak out more than teachers and librarians.”

For now, teenagers are seeking books and resources online and increasingly finding themselves right back at the public library — but this time, it’s online and in Brooklyn.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-his-florida-home-raided-by-fbi-3238091,"Donald Trump Says His Florida Home ""Raided"" By FBI","Former US president Donald Trump said Monday that his Mar-A-Lago residence in Florida was being ""raided"" by FBI agents in what he called an act of ""prosecutorial misconduct.""

""These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,"" he said in a statement posted on his Truth Social network.

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024,"" Trump added.

The FBI had not yet confirmed the search or said what it might be for, and Trump is at the center of a slew of legal investigations.

The US Department of Justice is investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mob of Trump's supporters -- an incident that is also the subject of a House of Representatives committee probe.

But Attorney General Merrick Garland has yet to point a finger at any one culprit.

""We have to hold accountable every person who is criminally responsible for trying to overturn a legitimate election,"" he said recently, emphasizing that ""no person is above the law.""

Trump taking at least 15 boxes of government documents with him to Florida following his 2020 election defeat is the subject of another probe.

Efforts to overturn the 2020 election results are also being investigated in the state of Georgia, while his business practices are being probed in New York.

The real estate mogul has not yet officially declared his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, though he has dropped strong hints over the past few months.

With President Joe Biden's approval rating currently below 40 percent and Democrats forecast to lose control of Congress in November midterm elections, Trump is apparently bullish that he could ride the Republican wave all the way to the White House in 2024.

https://indypendent.org/2022/07/anti-violence-advocates-propose-holistic-solutions-at-flatbush-town-hall-meeting/,Anti-Violence Advocates Propose Holistic Solutions at Flatbush Town Hall Meeting,"Roughly 100 local residents attended a town-hall meeting Thursday in Flatbush to address violence occurring in New York City. Among a sea of orange T-shirts exclaiming ‘communities united against gun violence,’ a diverse crowd shared food and passed drinks as panel members took their seats.

The panel brought together some of New York City’s leading anti-carceral organizers. They advocated a holistic approach to the issue of violence; instead of merely addressing the issue in terms of blood and bullets, muggings and homicides. Violence is too narrowly defined by the media and politicians and should include a wider range of aggressions and causes, panelists posited.

“What will we need to do to end gun violence? Universal mental health, living-wage jobs, $1 billion for community-based drug intervention, invest in our youth!, and affordable housing and investment in our neighborhoods,” read the poster announcing the event.

The event was co-moderated by New York Communities for Change tenant organizer Winsome Pendergrass and David Alexis, a democratic socialist who is challenging state senate District 21 incumbent Kevin Parker in the August 23 Democratic primary.

Panel members began by acknowledging the multitude of public safety crises that burden New Yorkers.

Panelist Jawanza Williams, activist and director of organizing at VOCAL-NY, a member-led organization that builds power among low-income people impacted by HIV/AIDS, the drug war, mass incarceration and homelessness, emphasized that “violence isn’t just bullets, mace, handcuffs. Violence is also the defunding of NYC public schools. Violence is also mass homelessness.” Williams pointed out that while the NYPD was fully funded in the city’s recently-announced annual budget, school funding and other public services were cut.

Also on the panel was Professor Alex Vitale, professor of sociology, coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and the author of The End of Policing. In the book, Vitale argues that the police, as an institution, are ill-suited for almost all the work they do and that their interactions with the public should be reduced to the absolute minimum possible.

At Thursday’s forum, Vitale juxtaposed the various forms of violence with the universal, solitary response to it. “Right now, there’s one strategy for all of these different types of violence: Let’s send the police.” He posits that this is a ‘supply-side strategy’ that is not working and will continue to be ineffective no matter the extent of police training or gun-control laws.

A call for a New Deal for Public Safety that would create 25,000 permanent new community-based, public safety jobs over the next five years.

“We’re going to criminalize the guns, criminalize the gun carrying, and we’re going to use the police to stop and search people, to stop people in cars, to get into everyone’s business in hopes of intimidating people so thoroughly that they won’t carry guns,” Vitale said. “Is it working? There are more people carrying guns than ever before. What we need is a demand-side strategy. Why are people picking up guns? Why are people carrying guns? Why are people using guns?”

Numerous studies have found that violence is caused by discriminatory public policy and often stoked by the police. Some cities and counties have actually discovered that by stopping prosecution of low-level, nonviolent crimes — by limiting neighborhood policing — violent crime rates went down.

“Police have not been effective in actually providing security or solving our problems. And what’s even worse is that they themselves are a source of problems, of violence and difficulty,” said Vitale. “Every day, they take more and more resources away from the things that we would really like to have to produce safe, healthy, secure communities. Where are the resources for our young people to do safe things after school? Where are the resources for affordable housing? These are the things that get at the real problem.”

Pendergrass agrees. Speaking with The Indypendent after the panel ended, she said, “to tackle the problem of violence, one needs to start in the home, the school, and the wider community.” For that reason, NYCC has endorsed Alexis. “We need someone new,” Pendergrass said. “Someone young, someone who is on the streets and knows what the youth want, what the middle class want and what the working class is fighting for.”

“It’s essential to try to stop the core reasons that cause gun crime, and I think that we can do this with an aggressive investment in the community.” Alexis told The Indypendent. His New Deal for Public Safety seeks to create 25,000 permanent new community-based public safety jobs over the next five years. Some of these positions include youth recreation workers, community anti-violence specialists, library support staff, homeless outreach workers, and drug-related harm-reduction workers. He also seeks to put thousands to work in well-paid, unionized construction jobs to build and maintain public housing, community centers, and schools. Moreover, Alexis wants to hire more mental health outreach workers, school counselors, drug treatment specialists, and trauma counselors. He contends that people will flock to these jobs because the wages, benefits, and job security would be increased to match that of police officers.

“Alternatives to policing exist,” said New York City Councilmember Tiffany Cabán (D-Astoria), a former public defender who also participated in the panel.

Pendergrass said the inspiration for the panel came from a May 22 demonstration against gun violence that NYCC organized in central Brooklyn. The event drew more than 200 people of all ages despite the stifling heat. NYCC decided to build on that momentum by organizing the town hall forum to engage the community more deeply.

Towards the end of the panel discussion, conversation was opened up to the audience. One woman asked a question in Spanish that was translated by one of the event’s interpreters. “My son is eight-years-old, and the question he asked me is, ‘How can we keep our schools safe and make sure no one can bring guns into the school?’,” she asked. Panelists responded by reemphasizing the need for robust community investment to combat crime and that guns — whether carried by teachers or cops — generally don’t reduce gun violence.

“Once a school shooting starts, it’s too late to call the police. People are already dead. That’s the lesson they learned in Uvalde. Forty percent of the local budget in Uvalde goes to police and they couldn’t save anyone,” said Vitale.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11025847/Prince-Harry-slammed-virtue-signaling-speech-comments-constitutional-rights.html,Prince Harry is slammed for 'virtue-signaling' UN speech,"Prince Harry has been slammed for 'virtue-signaling' as he waded into US politics yet again during his speech at an informal meeting of the UN General Assembly.

DailyMail.com columnist Meghan McCain blasted the Duke of Sussex for 'not offering any solutions' to the issues in America.

The Duke of Sussex, who was accompanied by Meghan Markle, launched a thinly-veiled attack on the Supreme Court's Roe v Wade ruling last month that handed abortion rights back to individual states.

The 37-year-old claimed it was part of a 'global assault on democracy and freedom' as he also cited Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine among problems facing the world.

The comments, heard by a mostly-empty room at the United Nations for Nelson Mandela Day on Monday morning, were the latest broadside at US politicians.

It comes after his wife Meghan described how the Duke had a 'gutteral' reaction to the Supreme Court's bombshell overturning of Roe v Wade last month.

Protesters also stood outside of the UN General Assembly in New York, with one holding up a sign which said 'why are they here'.

McCain said: 'Today was a missed opportunity to keep the focus on one of the truly great global leaders of all time, Nelson Mandela.

The Duke of Sussex made a thinly veiled slight on the US constitution during his speech at the UN on Monday, and has been slammed by American politicians

Protestors outside of the event in New York could be seen holding signs which demanded to know why the royal couple had attended the event

US Rep Buddy Carter said he thought that the Duke of Sussex, pictured entering the UN with wife Meghan Markle, comparing American abortion laws to the Ukraine war was 'sick and perverse'

Meghan later stepped out with activist Gloria Steinem after the pair had lunch together at the Crosby Hotel in Soho

'The speech should have been entirely a tribute to this man. But Prince Harry can't help himself. He has to get in his virtue-signaling.

'He wants you to know that he thinks America is a mess and he is judging it from his lectern.

'He's not offering solutions of any kind, mind you, just making a speech and getting back on his private jet to return to his mansion in California.'

Rep. Jason Smith, of Missouri, said: 'Once again, Harry and Meghan show how incredibly out of depth they are when it comes to American politics. Fortunately for the American people, elected officials and judges decide matters of law in the United States, not the United Nations and certainly not foreign celebrities.

'The last thing America needs is someone with the title 'Prince' to lecture us on Democracy and constitutional protections. There are better ways for Harry and Meghan to remain relevant than using their royal titles to opine on and try to influence U.S. politics.'

Meghan and Harry arrived hand-in-hand ahead of his speech to delegates on climate change and poverty during the two hour meeting at the UN.

It marks the first time the couple have been seen in public since jetting to the United Kingdom to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee last month, where they kept a low profile.

Despite the event meant to be in celebration of Nelson Mandela Day, the Prince launched an attack on American politics during his keynote speech.

He said: 'This has been a painful year in a painful decade. We are living through a pandemic that continues to ravage communities in every corner of the globe.

'Climate change wreaking havoc on our planet with most vulnerable suffering most of all. The few weaponizing lies and disinformation at the expense of the many.

'And from the horrific war in Ukraine to the rolling back of constitutional rights in the US we are witnessing a global assault on democracy and freedom the cause of Mandela's life.'

Royal biographer Robert Jobson also hit out at Harry, saying that he 'knew it would cause controversy' when giving his speech.

He said: 'I, like all right thinking people, believe in free speech. It is the core of democracy.

'Now that Prince Harry he had given up his royal role has the same right to speak out as the next man.

It is not the first time the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have waded into American politics, finding themselves in hot water after commenting on the US election

Prince Harry has been accused of knowing that his comments would cause 'controversy', despite agreeing to honor the Queen's stance of staying away from anything political when they stepped down

'So in that respect I commend him for a well thought out keynote address.

'That said, when the Queen gave her blessing to him to quit as a front line working royal and live with his wife in the US he promised not to bring the Royal Family into disrepute.

'He knows that his grandmother, our monarch, must remain above politics.

'He knows too when his father, The Prince of Wales, and brother, William, Duke of Cambridge make public addresses that they must remain non partisan, thus avoiding embarrassing the Queen and the institution of monarchy.

'Harry chose to speak about political issues at the UN. He knew it would cause controversy. He knew it would lead to criticism.

'It is his right now as a private citizen to make speeches - good luck to him.

'But had he not been a famous prince, from the privileged House of Windsor I mount very much he would not have been asked to make such an address.'

Both the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ignored questions about the impact of Tom Bower's book Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the war between the Windsor's

Harry and Meghan met with the President of the UN General Assembly Abdulla Ahahid as well as the two winners of the 2020 Nelson Mandela prize

Republican politicians were also quick to condemn the comments made by the Duke of Sussex during his keynote speech.

US Rep Buddy Carter said: 'The U.S. is protecting the lives of unborn children. Russia is killing innocent Ukrainians.

'We are not the same and comparing the two is sick and perverse. I would remind Prince Harry that spreading disinformation is incredibly damaging to the 'democracy and freedom' he is so concerned about.'

Rep. Lisa McClain added: 'Yet again, the Duke and Duchess are sticking their nose into American politics by attacking the U.S. rule of law.

'I think it's time we buy them a history book on the Revolutionary War to remind them that our government stopped caring about the 'royals' opinion back in 1776.'

Harry and Meghan's forays into US politics 2020 - During a September video shot for Time 100 before the presidential election, Harry and Meghan called on American voters to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' in 'the most important election of our life,' which was viewed as a not-so-veiled rebuke of President Donald Trump. Critics of the formerly-royal couple's comments included none other than her majesty's family, who noted the Sussexes vowed that 'everything they do will uphold the values of Her Majesty' - values that are supposed to include not picking sides in political matters. Buckingham Palace was forced to distance itself from Harry's remarks by saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the royal family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'. A Source close to the Sussexes also noted Meghan was keen to keep her American citizenship after she became a royal in case she ever wanted to go into US politics. The source told Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl that Meghan 'would seriously consider running for president' after she gave up her royal title. 2021 - Meghan is revealed to have been calling Republican senators on their personal phones and using her former royal title to urge them to vote in favor of a paid paternal leave legislation. 'This is Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex,' Markle reportedly said to West Virginia senator Moore Capito. She also did the same with Senator Susan Collins of Maine. 'Much to my surprise, she called me on my private line and introduced herself as the Duchess of Sussex, which is kind of ironic' said Collins. 'I was happy to talk with her, but I'm more interested in what people from Maine are telling me about paid leave,' she told Politico. She also submitted a 1,030 word letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in which she made made a plea for the parental legislation. The letter was written on Duchess of Sussex letterhead. In the letter, the former duchess wrote that the US's economic systems were 'past their expiration date' and 'too many Americans are forced to shortchange themselves when it comes to what matters to them.' 2022 - In May, Markle chartered a private jet to travel 1,400 miles to Texas where she laid a bouquet of white 'peace' roses at a memorial to the 19 children and two teachers slain at Robb Elementary School by murderous maniac Salvador Ramos. She also made a surprise visit to a blood center with two crates of food and drinks for donors, volunteers revealed, as one admitted: 'I had no idea who she was' and another confused her with a neighbor. Though cameras and news crews surrounded the memorial on Thursday, Markle did not make any remarks to the press. Then in an interview with Vogue following the overturning of Roe v Wade, Meghan also urged men to be 'more vocal' with their anger at the repealing of Roe v Wade and said that Prince Harry's response to the Supreme Court's decision last Friday was 'guttural.' 'My husband and I talked about that a lot over the past few days. He's a feminist too,' she said, adding 'We have to channel that fear into action. We can start this November in the midterms. We have to vote, every time.' Markle said she was willing to travel to Washington DC to join in on pro choice marches. Conservative Georgia congressman Rep. Buddy Carter chimed in on Markle's comments, saying 'I think Americans made it pretty clear in 1776 that they don't want members of the British Royal Family making decisions for them.' In earlier in the spring, the Sussexes hired Miranda Barbot, a former aide to president Barack Obama who was central to his successful reelection campaign in 2012. Advertisement

Editor Amber Athey wrote for the Spectator: 'I can't help but laugh at the same guy who called the First Amendment 'bonkers' fretting about an alleged erosion of constitutional rights.

'Presumably, if Prince Harry had his way, we'd be policing speech à la the UK, where you can be thrown in jail for supposed 'hate speech.'

This would constitute a much greater threat to freedom and democracy than anything referred to in Prince Harry's UN address.

'Prince Harry previously admitted that he does not fully 'understand' the US Constitution, having only been here a 'short time.' It's no surprise that he's made no attempt to rectify that in the past year.

'Harry hasn't got the American spirit. Red-blooded colonials once took up arms against the Duke of Sussex's ancestors; comparatively, Prince Harry sold his gun collection to appease his spoiled wife.'

It is not the first time the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have waded into American politics, finding themselves in hot water after commenting on the US election.

During a Time 100 video in September 2020 they called on American voters to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' in 'the most important election of our life.'

Members of the royal family are supposed to be politically neutral, when they stepped back from their roles the Sussex's vowed that 'everything they do will uphold the values of Her Majesty'.

'Just like Madiba, he's been through a lot': Prince Harry is mercilessly mocked by South African newspaper for preachy keynote speech honoring Nelson Mandela

BY JENNIFER SMITH

The choice of Prince Harry as the keynote speaker at the UN event honoring Nelson Mandela was mocked by many around the world, including a South African newspaper which sarcastically compared the prince's plight to that of the civil rights hero.

Harry was invited to speak at the UN in New York City by the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the charitable organization run by Mandela's family.

He was joined by wife Meghan, who showed up in a glamorous designer outfit worth some $3,000.

Harry used his 15-minute speech to lecture the sparse crowd on climate change, disinformation, the war on Ukraine, COVID and the decision by SCOTUS to reverse Roe vs Wade.

He might have resisted the chance to compare himself to Mandela, but South African newspaper The Sunday Times jumped at the opportunity.

South African columnist Aspasia Karras pokes fun at Prince Harry in a column on Sunday, before Harry spoke. She compared Harry's Montecito mansion to Robben Island and the icy treatment of Harry and Meghan by the royal family to the hardships of apartheid

'He's in exile. Just like Madiba. No, sorry, of course, he was imprisoned for 27 years on Robben Island. Same, same-ish. Harry is imprisoned in his gilded pleasure palace in Montecito with a podcast schedule and documentary team following him around,' wrote Sunday Times columnist Aspasia Karras

Harry was invited to speak at the UN in New York City by the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the charitable organization run by Mandela's family, some of whom Harry maintains friendships with.

In a column on Sunday, before Harry spoke, Editor-at-Large Aspasia Karras wrote: 'He's in exile. Just like Madiba.

'No, sorry, of course, he was imprisoned for 27 years on Robben Island. Same, same-ish.

'Harry is imprisoned in his gilded pleasure palace in Montecito with a podcast schedule and documentary team following him around.'

She labeled him the 'self-styled Duke of L.A.' and said: 'Just like Mandela, he's been through a lot.

'As told to Oprah in his cri du coeur interview, his family and the British press have been giving him and his lovely wife Meghan such a hard time. All they wanted was to represent. And bring some fast paced LA management style to the fuddy-duddy palace.

They clapped as they listened along to the speakers, as two winners of the Nelson Mandela Prize were awarded in person

'You know what? They just had to leave. It was too much to bear.'

'I think Harry is a perfect fit, what with the UN being such a very effective organization for world peace.

'I'm really pleased he can grab hold of the global spotlight on such an important day, when we remember the sacrifices Mandela made for all of us and our rights. OK?

'But especially for Harry's right to a security entourage. That will show them,' she wrote.

Other critics asked why Harry, who regularly uses private jets, had been chosen to give a speech on climate change.

'Our world is on fire!' he told the UN on Monday after arriving in New York City with Meghan, who wore more than $3,000 in designer clothes.

It's unclear whether the couple arrived in New York City on a private jet.

Representatives for the pair did not immediately respond to inquiries about their travel, nor did spokespeople for The Nelson Mandela Foundation.",Q3

https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/italian-american-groups-upset-with-panels-recommendation-to-permanently-remove-chicagos-columbus-statues/,Italian American groups upset with panel's recommendation to permanently remove Chicago's Columbus statues,"CHICAGO (CBS) -- The future of several Chicago statues, up in the air. More than two years after protests turned violent at the Christopher Columbus statue in Grant Park, a city panel has recommended that it and several other statues be permanently removed, saying they honor white supremacy or disrespect indigenous people.

Some local organizations are pushing back against the recommendation to permanently remove the Columbus statue in Grant Park, as well as Columbus statues in Arrigo Park and the South Chicago neighborhood.

Those statues were taken down in the summer of 2020, after protesters tried to tear down the Columbus statue in Grant Park. Afterward, Mayor Lori Lightfoot created the Chicago Monuments Project to review hundreds of public monuments in Chicago as part of a ""a racial healing and historical reckoning project.""

Last year, that panel flagged 41 public monuments as ""problematic,"" and on Friday recommended dozens of sculptures and plaques in Chicago be modified or taken down altogether; most prominently, the three Columbus statues.

""Regarded by many members of the Italian American community as a symbol of cultural pride, the image of Columbus has become a bitter reminder of centuries of exploitation, conquest and genocide. To many, the display of this figure is seen as a justification of these historic wrongs,"" the panel's recommendation found.

Now, some Italian Americans in Chicago are pushing back on the panel's recommendations, saying they want the Columbus statues put back.

""We're not going to stand for it and were not going away,"" said Ron Onesti, president of the Joint Civic Community of Italian Americans. ""It represents our traditions, our culture, our families. It's come to represent that, and you can't just rip that away from us.""

Onesti said there's a difference between creating nuanced history, and taking down monuments.

We asked if he's open to the idea of updating the narrative written in conjunction with the statue.

""We've all grown up with Christopher Columbus; sailed the ocean blue in 1492, and discovered America. That's all we all were taught. We understand that the narratives need to be broadened, the stories need to be told. We want to help tell those stories,"" he said.

The three Columbus monuments in Chicago have been in storage since the mayor had them taken down in 2020, when our city saw a year of racial reckoning, protests at the statues, and began to reevaluate public art in a big way.

""We need to establish history. Make history. You can't bury history,"" Onesti said.

The study also said protecting the Columbus statues from further vandalism would be difficult to do with city resources, while some Italian Americans say they've been looking into private security solutions.

""We want work hand-in-hand with the mayor. We want safety. She just has never given us the time of day, or the respect of a meeting,"" Onesti said.

Including the Columbus statues, the Chicago Monument Project's report pinpointed more than 40 public art pieces either in need to modification or where they recommended removal, including the sculptures on the DuSable Bridge over the Chicago River. The sculptures depict the Battle of Fort Dearborn, and the report says the images show Native Americans as ""merely a foil to help define the heroic acts and qualities of colonizing forces.""

The Bowman and The Spearman statues on Columbus Circle and Ida B. Wells Drive are also recommended to go. The report says they present ""stylized and unrealistic images of American Indians.""

The report also recommends doing away with a number of plaques, including one on Michigan Avenue near Randolph Street, honoring John Kinzie and Jean Baptiste Beaubien as the city's first and second civilians. The report says those plaques prioritize ""whiteness and denies the existence of Native peoples, and earlier settler Jean Baptiste Point du Sable.""

The findings in this report were just recommendations, not hard rulings. The mayor has not said if she agrees with the findings, or what the next steps will be, though she did issue a statement calling the study an ""important milestone"":",Q3

CHICAGO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Robert Crimo III, the suspect of a mass shooting during an Independence Day parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, on Wednesday faced 110 additional criminal charges after a Lake County grand jury handed down an indictment.

Crimo, 22, already faced seven counts of first-degree murder for the shooting on July 4 in Highland Park, in the U.S. state of Illinois.

The indictment announced Wednesday added an additional 14 counts of first-degree murder for a total of 21, Chicago Tribune reported.

The grand jury also indicted Crimo on 48 counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery for each victim who was injured by gunfire when he used a high-powered rifle and fired more than 83 rounds from a rooftop overlooking the parade in downtown Highland Park.

The mass shooting killed seven people and wounded dozens of others. Crimo was arrested on the same day of the shooting. Police said Crimo pre-planned the attack for several weeks and acted alone. Enditem",Q3

The wildfire is continuing to inch up in size, measuring 60,044 acres as of Saturday morning.

A survey that's underway has found the McKinney Fire has destroyed 87 homes and 45 other structures, fire officials said.

Crews doing inspections found another 134 structures had not been damaged, while four structures received minor damage.

The inspection crews have examined a total of 274 structures so far in the initial damage assessment phase, which is more than 50% complete, the Siskiyou County Office of Emergency Services said on Friday.

Four people have died in the wildfire, the largest in California so far this fire season. Those individuals have not yet been identified.

Officials say they expect to gain more containment as fire crews aggressively fight the blaze and dig fire lines. There is no expected date for full containment, according to state fire authorities.

While the situation has improved with more than 2,700 personnel working on the fire, ""It's not out yet,"" Klamath National Forest Supervisor Rachel Smith said. Lightning is continuing to spark fires in the area, she said.

""I wanted to ask you to stay vigilant and remain patient. The next 72 hours are going to be pretty important for us as we're working to button up this fire,"" Smith said.

Fire behavior analyst Dennis Burns cautioned that conditions forecast for Sunday and Monday ""are going to be almost identical to when this fire started. The biggest fear is that we have a jackpot of unburned fuel within the fire perimeter ... and it ignites.""

Saturday is expected to be hot and dry, with a potential for thunderstorms that could start fires, Burns said.

There have been some recent wins, according to Siskiyou County Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue.

""It is very exciting that we have been able to get people back into their homes. Others are still waiting. We just ask for continued patience as we move forward. This is a long process,"" he said.

After several sections of Yreka and Hawkinsville were downgraded from evacuation orders to evacuation warnings, residents there were able to return to their homes, the Siskiyou County Office of Emergency Services said.

Late Friday afternoon, the sheriff issued new evacuation warnings for some areas east of Happy Camp due to wildfire activity.

Pushed by dry conditions and wind, the McKinney Fire leveled the small town of Klamath River. Thunderstorms on Tuesday evening led to flash flooding and destructive flows of mud and debris in the wildfire area.

More than 7,300 of the county's 44,000 residents have been affected by evacuation orders or warnings since the wildfire started July 29, officials said.

Siskiyou County Office of Emergency Service Director Bryan Schenone said 6,000 structures were located within the current evacuation zones.

The cause of the McKinney Fire remains under investigation by a specialized U.S. Forest Service team.

Yeti and Alex fires

A community meeting about the lightning-caused Yeti and Alex fires is set for 7 p.m. Saturday at Happy Camp High School, 234 Indian Creek Road. A livestream will be at Facebook.com/KlamathNF.

The two fires were a combined 7,721 acres as of Saturday morning. The Yeti Fire was 7,570 acres with 0% containment and the Alex Fire was 151 acres with 20% containment.

Anthony Hernandez, 19, of Milwaukee faces charges in connection with a fatal crash during a police pursuit that happened July 28. Prosecutors say he was driving a stolen car and shouldn't have been behind the wheel in the first place because he's never had a valid license. Additionally, he was out on bond for driving a stolen car.

Hernandez faces five felonies and a misdemeanor: second-degree reckless homicide; operator flee/elude officer, causing death; knowingly operating without a valid license, causing death; operator flee/elude officer -- bodily harm or property damage; drive or operate without consent and misdemeanor bail jumping.

Police spotted a stolen Kia Sportage near Greeley and Deer Place and activated their lights and sirens, but the driver didn't stop. A 10-minute pursuit ensued, lasting about 9 miles and reaching speeds of up to 80 miles per hour. Prosecutors say Hernandez, the driver, disregarded stop signs and traffic lights during the pursuit, nearly striking multiple vehicles.

Near 35th and Wisconsin, he did hit another vehicle, colliding with a Chevy Equinox at 65 miles per hour, according to the vehicle's data, a criminal complaint said. The Chevy driver suffered minor injuries.

The impact of that crash sent the Kia into a Honda Odyssey minivan, and the Kia rolled. The Honda driver had multiple surgeries at the hospital and was placed on a ventilator before ultimately passing away.

According to prosecutors, the owner of the Kia reported it stolen on July 27, the day before the pursuit and crash, while it was parked on Kinnickinnic Avenue.

Hernandez has never had a valid driver's license, prosecutors say.

A 20-year-old man in New York has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly shooting dead an employee of American fast-food giant McDonald's for allegedly serving his mother cold fries, according to police and media reports.

The deceased identified as Kevin Holloman, 23, died from three gunshot injuries at 771 Herkimer St. in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn on Monday, the New York Post reported citing police.

The shooter Michael Morgan, who is facing charges of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon in Monday's fast-food shooting, was also slapped with murder and criminal possession of weapon charges over a killing in October 21, 2020, New York Post reported citing police.

The publication citing police reported that Morgan stormed the McDonald's after his mother began questioning workers about cold French fries. The workers reportedly laughed at her for asking to speak to a manager and later Morgan barged into the restaurant in his mother's defence.

Soon after the incident on Tuesday night, Morgan was arrested and charged with the shooting, police said.

The mother of the shooter told in an interview with The Post that her son said afterward he did what he had to do.

She described what exactly what led up to the shooting. ""I talked to my son with the cops. My son is just saying that he gotta do what he gotta do and the [victim] came after him and whatever happened, happened,'' said Lisa Fulmore

Shooting incidents have become more frequent in the United States.

On August 2, one person was killed and at least six men were shot at an apartment complex in the northeastern part of Washington DC. The shooting was reported at about 8:30 pm (US time) in the 1500 block of F Street North East, outside the Azeeze Bates apartment complex The Washington Post reported citing Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said in a news conference.

Monday's violent night included three other shootings, none of which were fatal. A woman was shot on Gainesville Street SE; a man was shot on Newton Place NW; and another man was shot on Oglethorpe Street NE, all within the space of a few hours, according to officials.

With increasing incidents of gun violence in the United States, President Joe Biden had said that the US needs to ban assault weapons for the sake of protecting children and families or raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.

Furthermore, on June 22, a group of US lawmakers reached a much-awaited deal on a bipartisan gun safety bill after recent mass shooting incidents in Uvalde, Buffalo and Texas, that struck a nerve in the country.

The new bill aims to take firearms away from dangerous people and provide billions of dollars in new mental health funding.

The bill does not ban assault-style rifles or significantly expand background-check requirements for gun purchases, but it gives states more resources to take guns away from dangerous individuals.

In recent incidents, 7 people were hospitalized after a mass shooting in Orlando, Florida last week.

An unidentified assailant pulled out a handgun and fired into the crowd, injuring seven people, reported CNN.

A similar incident took place in the Haltom City of Texas last week where two people were killed and four others including three officers were injured.

Police said that one woman was found dead inside the home and a man was found fatally shot in the home's driveway. An elderly woman who called 911 was shot but expected to survive.

On May 24, a mass shooting incident took place at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas in which several people including 19 children were killed. This was the deadliest attack since the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed, according to CNN.

On June 20, a teenager was shot dead and three others including a police officer were injured in a shooting in the area of 14th and U Street Northwest in Washington, DC. The shootout incidents in the US have been increasing.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/17/trump-legal-peril-republicans/,Opinion | Trump has never been in so much peril. Nor has the GOP.,"It is hard to keep track of all the criminal statutes that might apply to defeated former president Donald Trump regarding actions leading up to and after the 2020 election. The media have lately focused on three statutes that Trump might have violated in retaining highly classified documents, as cited in the FBI search warrant for his Mar-a-Lago home: the Espionage Act; Section 1519 of the U.S. Code, relating to obstruction of an investigation; and Section 2071, relating to theft of government documents.

These potential violations could be on top of the potential charges regarding his phony elector scheme; his effort to pressure former vice president Mike Pence to illegally reject electoral votes; and his invitation and incitement of the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021. As to incitement, University of Chicago law professor emeritus Albert W. Alschuler, writing for Just Security, argues that Trump’s failure to act once the insurrection was underway and his 2:24 p.m. tweet further riling up the crowd against Pence might be powerful evidence against Trump on the charge of “aiding and abetting” the insurrection, since Trump had a legal duty to intervene.

And then, of course, there are the Georgia state criminal statutes that Trump might have violated in his effort to pressure state officials in Georgia to “find” just enough votes to flip the state’s election. Fani T. Willis, the district attorney for Fulton County, Ga., is moving full speed ahead with her investigation, with an eye on charges that could include conspiracy to commit voting fraud, interference with performance of an official’s duties and violation of Georgia’s racketeering law.

Considering the parade of witnesses appearing before the FBI, the federal grand jury and the grand jury in Georgia, prosecutors are no doubt collecting a mound of evidence against the former president. And the more witnesses who talk, the higher the risk that someone strikes a deal to incriminate Trump. The identification of Rudy Giuliani as a target in the Georgia investigation raises the potential that even Trump’s attorney might turn on him to avoid prosecution.

Altogether, it seems Trump is in more legal peril than ever before. His misconceptions about the criminal justice system and his supporters’ wishful thinking do not diminish the danger of indictment.

Trump’s lame overtures to Attorney General Merrick Garland to “reduce the heat” of the political fallout from the Mar-a-Lago search — while simultaneously insinuating that violence might occur if the Justice Department keeps pursuing him — is as disingenuous as it is utterly irrelevant to Garland. The Justice Department’s prosecutors and investigators certainly don’t care if Republicans are still enthralled with Trump. They will go after anyone who engages in acts of violence, as Garland made clear in his remarks last week in which he demanded that people stop impugning and threatening the FBI.

Likewise, while Trump seems convinced that announcing his presidential bid for 2024 would make it harder for prosecutors to indict him, that’s another Trumpian delusion. Garland has reiterated he will pursue the facts and the law regardless of where they lead. And he added credibility to that statement with his nervy decision to execute the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. The bottom line: Cult support for Trump is not going to buy him any relief from legal woes.

So if Trump is in deep legal trouble, what can we say about his party? Well, think of this as a “shooting someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue” moment. Republicans are apparently willing to stick with Trump even if he’s caught red-handed in committing crimes. As Never Trumper Charlie Sykes writes for the Bulwark:

On a segment of Deadline White House yesterday, guest host John Heilemann asked Punchbowl’s Jake Sherman and me a provocative question: Could the GOP actually nominate someone who was under indictment for espionage? We were asked only to give a one-word answer. We both said: yes.

That’s the road the GOP seems ready to go down. The party is putting all of its eggs in the basket of a guy who might be indicted under a variety of legal theories in state and federal court. Sure, it might dawn on some Republicans that this might not be a wise strategy. But even if the party shifts to another contender, Trump will almost certainly set out to destroy that candidate’s chances.

You can find plenty of Republican hacks on TV insisting that the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago is a political “win” for Trump. But what is he winning? Certainly not protection from prosecution. And this sort of “win” for Trump creates a potentially debilitating problem for the party, which will be pressed into defending his conduct. One wonders what Republicans really think about the possibility of having to run down-ballot from someone who could be under indictment.",Q3

http://coloradosun.com/2022/09/08/homelessness-downtown-denver/,Denver business leaders want immediate answers to homelessness as downtown struggles to rebound,"Denver needs at least 30,000 affordable apartments to solve the homelessness crisis, eliminate tent encampments and restore the atmosphere that defined downtown. If everything goes as planned in the next five years, the city will add 5,000 to 6,000 units.

The huge gap was a key point as Denver business owners, increasingly frustrated by the state of downtown, discussed their concerns this week with organizations that help the homeless find housing and shelter.

“It’s bad and getting worse” was the title of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce agenda, and there was no argument from even the groups working to solve the problem. The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and the state Office of Homeless Initiatives are providing more housing and services than ever before, but cannot keep up with the demand.

Colorado needs about 14,600 supportive housing units, which come with not only rent assistance but mental health, addiction and medical care, according to a study by the national Corporation for Supportive Housing. Today, the Coalition for the Homeless has about 1,500 Denver units of supportive housing, considered the best solution for eliminating tent encampments and the need for city-sanctioned camps because they house those who are chronically homeless and often need therapy in order to stay housed.

While business owners support long-term solutions for housing, they also want immediate help, said Beth Moyski, a senior vice president with Downtown Denver Partnership, which advocates for the business community. She regularly hears from business owners who say their customers feel unsafe downtown because of the number of people on the streets, including those who have mental illness and are talking to themselves as they pass by.

“I get phone calls from property managers and property owners who say, ‘There is an encampment in the alley or across the street from me. What are you going to do about it?’” she said.

Moyski said she is concerned not only about businesses, but about people who are homeless and hurt by others who are on the streets. “A lot of those folks are victimized by criminals who are bringing drugs into the environment and other activities that are illegal,” she said. “We are working with the police department to address the criminal element.”

The Downtown Denver Partnership also wants a higher level of staffing in the city’s Support Team Assisted Response, or STAR, program, an alternative to police response that involves sending a worker trained in mental health.

But homeless advocates said Colorado is due for big-time solutions.

“We have the same goal: We want to see people off the streets,” said John Parvensky, head of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. “We want them to have a safe place to be, hopefully in their own home. But the approach is not to criminalize homelessness. It’s to create and build those solutions that we know work, and to do it at a scale that is commensurate with the need and not to solve 5% of the problem.”

The number of people who are homeless is ever changing, as the annual homeless count shows that the majority of people sleeping in shelters and in tents became homeless within the previous year. The latest count found 6,888 people were homeless in the seven-county metro area on one night in January, which organizers say means there are an estimated 31,000 who are homeless over the course of the year.

Add to that a survey on the same night that found about 30 people who are homeless were hospitalized. And, statewide, there are 21,000 public school students who are homeless, either living in shelters, doubling up with other families or sleeping on friends’ couches.

In a room full of business professionals in suits, some wanted numbers: How much money would it take to get everyone off the streets and into housing?

David Zucker, CEO of Zocalo Community Development, a real estate developer dedicated to affordable housing, attempted a rough calculation of the math.

Each of the 14,600 supportive housing units needed in Colorado would cost about $300,000 to build, so that’s about $4.4 billion. The units would cost about $300 million per year to operate, including mental health and medical services.

“A significant amount of money,” he said.

But the investment could pay off in the long term, Zucker said, noting that it costs taxpayers thousands of dollars per year per person who is homeless in medical, jail and other services. Eliminating encampments could revitalize business, resulting in increased sales and tax revenues for the city and state.

Kristin Toombs, director of the state Office of Homeless Initiatives, touted a new tax credit for businesses that invest in solving homelessness. Beginning in 2023, businesses that donate to create affordable housing or assistance for the homeless can receive tax credits of 25% of the total contribution in cities or 30% in rural areas.

Brandt Van Sickle, homelessness liaison for the City of Aurora, looks for unsheltered people on the morning of Jan. 25, 2022. Annual “point-in-time” observations and surveys, usually taking place in late January, are conducted early in the morning to avoid overcounting the population. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)

Moyski, with the Downtown Denver Partnership, said she agrees that long-term investments work. The city’s nationally recognized social impact bond program, which sends outreach workers to the streets to find the most frequent users of emergency rooms and jails and offers them housing, kept 77% of participants in housing and off the streets three years later.

But while Colorado is waiting on results, business and property owners need more, she said.

“They feel safer when there is a more uniformed presence, when they see outreach workers,” Moyski said. “The hard part is that gap in between.”",Q3
https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/ex-cops-kueng-thao-sentenced-for-violating-george-floyds-civil-rights/3317392/,Ex-Minneapolis Officers Sentenced for Violating George Floyd's Civil Rights,"The last two former Minneapolis police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd’s civil rights during his May 2020 killing were sentenced Wednesday in federal court to three and 3 1/2 years — penalties that a judge said reflected their level of culpability in a case that sparked worldwide protests as part of a reckoning over racial injustice.

J. Alexander Kueng was sentenced to three years and Tao Thao got 3 1/2 years. They were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd’s civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Derek Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd’s neck for 9 1/2 minutes.

As Chauvin pinned Floyd’s neck, Kueng held Floyd’s back, Officer Thomas Lane held his feet and Thao kept bystanders back during the killing, which was recorded by bystanders.

The federal government brought the civil rights charges against all four officers in May 2021, a month after Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court. They were seen as an affirmation of the Justice Department’s priorities to address racial inequities in policing, a promise made by President Joe Biden before his election. And they came just a week after federal prosecutors brought hate crimes charges in the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and announced two sweeping probes into policing in two states.

Kueng and Thao were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd’s civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Chauvin. Kueng, who is Black, was sentenced to three years on each count, to be served concurrently. Thao, who is Hmong American, was due to be sentenced later Wednesday.

The lower sentence for Kueng and Thao raise questions about whether he would consider a plea deal or risk a state court trial on Oct. 24, when they face counts of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Chauvin, who pleaded guilty last year to violating Floyd's civil rights and the civil rights of a teenager in an unrelated case, was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison. Lane, who twice asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side so he could breathe, was convicted of one count and was sentenced last week to 2 1/2 — a sentence Floyd's brother Philonise called “insulting.”

Kueng and Thao got a victory last week when Magnuson issued rulings that affected how their federal sentences would be calculated. The rulings — particularly one that cross-references their crimes with involuntary manslaughter instead of murder — meant the men headed into Wednesday's hearings with a recommended range of 4 1/4 years to 5 1/4 years. They might have faced a life sentence.

Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law and former federal prosecutor, said ahead of the hearings that Kueng and Thao would likely seek a plea deal on the state charges that won't exceed the federal sentence and will let them serve the sentences concurrently.

Kueng and Thao can still appeal their federal convictions. If they plead guilty in state court, any federal appeal would be moot, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who has been following the case. But it's also hard to win a federal appeal, he said.

“Those are some of the calculuses they are going to have to make in terms of, `Do I go to trial and risk something worse? Do I think I have a good shot at appeal on the federal case?'"" Brandt said.

Lane, who is white, pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and is awaiting sentencing in that case. He was allowed to remain free on bond after his federal sentencing.

Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to a 22 1/2-year state sentence in addition to his federal sentence. Those sentences are being served simultaneously.",Q3

The official ruling came a day after Ivana, 73, was found dead in her Manhattan residence.

The New York Attorney General's Office said it had agreed, at the request of lawyers for Donald Trump and two of his children, to postpone depositions scheduled for next week in light of Ivana's death.

Ivana Trump, the first wife of former President Donald Trump, died in an accident as a result of suffering blunt impact injuries to her torso, New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Friday.

A senior New York City official with direct knowledge of the matter said the circumstances of her death are consistent with a fall on the stairs, NBC News reported. The official added the death is not suspicious.

The official ruling came a day after Ivana, 73, was found dead in her Manhattan residence after the New York Fire Department responded to a call from there.

Earlier Friday, the New York state Attorney General's Office said it had agreed at the request of lawyers for Donald Trump and two of his children to postpone depositions of them that had been scheduled for next week in light of Ivana's death.

A spokesperson for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said the cause of Ivana's death was ""blunt impact trauma"" and the manner of her death was ""accident.""

""Having released this determination, OCME will not comment further on the investigation,"" the spokesperson said.

A senior New York City official told NBC News on Thursday that Ivana Trump was found on the spiral staircase of her apartment when authorities first arrived.

Before the medical examiner's findings were released Friday, Donald Trump said that ""out of love and respect for Ivana"" he was postponing a rally scheduled for Saturday in Arizona to support the Republican candidate for governor, Kari Lake, until July 22.

Ivana, who was a former model and ski racer, was born in what at the time was Czechoslovakia.

She married the brash real-estate mogul Trump in 1977 and went on to hold top positions in his companies, including the Trump Organization.

The couple had three children — Donald Trump Jr., 44, Ivanka Trump, 40, and Eric Trump, 38.

The Trumps' divorce in 1990 was acrimonious, with both parties waging their battle in the Big Apple's tabloid newspapers, the New York Post and the New York Daily News, as much as in the courtroom.

The split was at least partially sparked by Donald Trump's affair with Marla Maples, who went on to become his second wife.

Trump, 76, married his third wife, Melania, in 2005.

The elder Trump, Donald Jr. and Ivanka had been set to be deposed next week by investigators from Attorney General Letitia James' office as part of an investigation into how the Trump Organization has stated the value of various real estate assets. James is eyeing whether the company illegally manipulated those valuations for financial benefits, such as reduced taxes or more favorable loan terms.

Eric Trump previously was deposed in the case, but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 500 times, James' office said in a January court filing.

James' spokesperson on Friday said, ""In light of the passing of Ivana Trump yesterday, we received a request from counsel for Donald Trump and his children to adjourn all three depositions, which we have agreed to.""

""This is a temporary delay, and the depositions will be rescheduled as soon as possible. There is no other information about dates or otherwise to provide at this time,"" the spokesperson said.

""We offer our condolences to the Trump family.""",Q3

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This story is part of Sunday Life’s most popular cover stories of 2022. See all 10 stories . There is something of the Disney princess about Trinny Woodall as she strides towards me in the shiny Chelsea HQ of Trinny London, her beauty empire that in five scant years has gone from struggling to find investors to being valued at £180 million [$300 million]. Like Belle, she is clad in yellow. Like Rapunzel, she has really good hair. Like Snow White, she has lips as red as a rose. Unlike those hapless three, she doesn’t need to be rescued. For Trinny is her own heroine, and the skilled author of her own fairy tale. Back off, Prince Charming. You’ll ruin her lipstick. Today, the woman who first found fame in the early 2000s co-hosting the makeover show What Not to Wear is wearing a lipstick hue called Rossy, a poppy-red from her Lip2Cheek range. Launched in 2017, Trinny London’s success is down to an alchemical mix of clever products and innovative tech, all driven by its charismatic founder, whose enthusiastic social media presence (almost two million Facebook followers, one million Instagram followers and 338,000 subscribers on YouTube) is a powerful driver of sales. Her core customer is the midlife woman whose life is beginning to show on her face. Trinny eschews using models on her website in favour of featuring “real” women aged from their 40s to their 80s. Her fans, known as Trinny’s Tribe, lap up her honesty and love that she’ll talk as openly about her bowel movements as she will about her blusher. One commented: “Her clothes are outright strange, her fillers are borderline frightening, but there’s something really likeable about her that keeps me watching.” Settling down to talk in her office (she in canary-yellow Asos trousers and a silver Dries Van Noten vest), I start by congratulating her on the company’s recent sales figures and ask whether she was surprised by them.

“I was, because they’re not correct,” she says archly. “I’m not going to correct them, because there are certain figures which we don’t publish, but they were ambiguous. But sales did increase. They’d increased the year before, three times.” Between March 2020 and January 2021, the brand grew by 280 per cent, delivering £44 million in gross revenue in the year to March 2021. Not bad during a pandemic. “What helped us a lot is that women didn’t want to stop buying things. They may not have wanted to buy clothing, so they bought make-up instead.” Lockdown might have spelt disaster for many businesses, but not Trinny’s. Her theory for this is that, with 95 per cent of sales already online, she didn’t have as far to pivot. Hers was among the first beauty brands to offer one-to-one online consultations, launching the service a mere 10 days after lockdown was announced; 3000 appointments were booked in the first 24 hours. Loading “What helped us a lot is that women didn’t want to stop buying things,” she says. “They may not have wanted to buy clothing, so they bought make-up instead. They became quite obsessed with developing a skincare routine, and trying new things. “Although women were much busier during COVID, we also needed time for ourselves, because we were juggling. If you were looking after the house, working from home, and your kids weren’t at school, having that time was so very precious. You needed that time just to do something for you.”

My own theory is that Trinny is a P, or Perceiving, in the Myers-Briggs personality types; a person whose stellar communication skills were perfectly placed to profit from the pandemic. Like Joe Wicks, who also found huge success during lockdown, Trinny is a born communicator. Just as he got people fit, Trinny got them glowing. As she tells me today, “I want women to feel they’ve become ageless – that they’re feeling phwoar.” At the start of the pandemic, her company employed 68 people; now, it employs 200. It sells 187 products in 200 countries, with a pot of its line-filling Miracle Blur primer selling every 60 seconds. Skincare was only launched in February, but already accounts for almost a third of sales; she’s confident that it will soon amount to 50 per cent of her business. “And then, at some point, we’ll bring out another vertical.” Haircare? Body care? “I can’t tell you. It will be what it will be.” “I want women to feel they’ve become ageless – that they’re feeling phwoar,” says Woodall of her beauty brand. Credit: Anna Mårtensson/Headpress As the company’s main shareholder, with a 42 per cent stake, what Trinny will be is even wealthier than she already is. Which must feel particularly gratifying, given how hard she initially found it to get investment. (Don’t imagine that a woman with a clever idea and decades of experience will be able to pluck freely from the money tree: in business, men and women are still judged by different standards. “So many discrepancies,” Trinny sighs. ) Undeterred, she raised £60,000 by selling off items from her own wardrobe, then hustled for another £7 million, a small but undisclosed amount of which was provided by her partner of nine years, businessman and art collector Charles Saatchi. “I couldn’t afford to live in the house I was living in, so I rented it out and sold quite a few of my clothes. I then did a small raise, which I used for product development. When that ran out, I sold some more clothes, then sold my house because I couldn’t afford the mortgage. It did take balls – it was very scary. But I knew I had no alternative. Nobody becomes a great entrepreneur from a place of comfort.” Asked what she’s learnt about money along the way, she replies, “I’ve learnt what you can live without. Until I was 18, I had a very nice, entitled life. Then my dad had some things that went a bit wrong. So I went and earned a salary, working a Saturday job at Partridges [delicatessen], cutting the meat. It took me a long time to figure out what I wanted to do – probably until I was 27. The years before were really difficult.”

That’s an understatement. Unlike Cinderella, Woodall’s isn’t a rags to riches tale, but a riches to rags to riches one. Born Sarah-Jane Woodall (the “Trinny” nickname came from a friend who likened her to a St Trinian’s character) in London, her father was a banker, her mother Ann his second wife. The youngest of three children (with three half-siblings from her father’s first marriage), she was sent to boarding school aged six. “It did take balls – it was very scary. But I knew I had no alternative. Nobody becomes a great entrepreneur from a place of comfort.” At 16, she started experimenting with drugs, with alcohol becoming an addiction in her 20s. Stints in rehab followed until, at 26, having lost close friends to alcoholism, she reached rock bottom and sought treatment for a final time. She has been sober for 32 years. Her next brush with dependency came by proxy, after her marriage to property developer Johnny Elichaoff in 1999. Their 10 years together were marred by his addiction to painkillers, acquired after a motorbike accident in 2006. Trinny went through 16 rounds of IVF and several miscarriages before their daughter, Lyla, was born in 2003. The pair split in 2009, co-parenting amicably until 2014, when Elichaoff

fell to his death from the roof of a shopping centre in London, having lost all his assets due to a string of failed investments. Creditors launched legal action against Trinny, seeking repayment of his debts, despite them having being accrued after their divorce. The case was dismissed in late 2016. Trinny is incredibly close to Lyla, now a cheerful 18-year-old who plans to take a year out before studying film at a university in New York. “She got a scholarship,” says Trinny proudly.

At the weekend, the pair attended a bat mitzvah together, giving Trinny a rare opportunity to dance with Lyla. “That made me happy. There was one guy there, dancing with his three daughters. Those are the moments when I wish Lyla still had a dad. All these people came up and said, ‘You’ve brought up such a nice daughter,’ and I was so proud. Lyla can be very kind.” She can also be very covetous of her mother’s wardrobe. “She sniffs around. She helped herself to my Gabriela Hearst jacket the other day. Lyla has a very eclectic style. I love it.” The biggest challenge of raising a teenager is, she says, “doing it without her father. Not having the other person in the room to say what I should do.” Loading Though Lyla has a half-brother, Zak, 27, Trinny says that not having siblings is the reason she sent her to boarding school. “Hardest decision. But she still feels centred with my life because there’s only her in it. She knows I’d drop everything for her.” She does worry about passing on the genes that made her and Elichaoff prone to addiction, but adds, “I think the most important thing that you can give a child is a sense of confidence. So whatever path she chooses to take in her life, she’s not taking it from fear. It’s important to make them feel seen, loved, everything. Flaws and all.” Successful as she’s been, it wasn’t until her 50s that Trinny came to love her own flaws. “When you reach 50, you don’t care. You don’t worry what people think about you, and that gives you a great freedom to say what you feel. Now, what you see is what you get.”

The Foothill-De Anza Community College District office is located in Los Altos Hills. Photo by Magali Gauthier.

Jacob Beeman’s transfer goals were pushed back by about a year because he was taking the wrong community college classes to transfer.

“I had been jumping through all these hoops to try and get the right classes I needed to transfer and going off the advice of people who I trusted to know what they were doing,” he said.

Except Beeman, 26, who was interested in transferring into the University of California system to study chemical engineering, said he was incorrectly advised by three different advisers while attending Fresno City College.

“Different advisers thought I needed one particular class — a communications class,” he said. “And then I found out later that that particular class UC didn’t accept, so I had to sign up for another one. And then I was told the UC doesn’t actually require a communications class at all.”

Beeman’s experience is familiar to many students. A recent EdSource special report, “A broken system of university transfers,” detailed the barriers for students who want to transfer into the state’s public universities. As a 2021 study found, only 2.5 percent actually do so in two years or less and 23 percent in four years or less.

EdSource, a nonprofit news organization covering education in California, also conducted a survey of current and former students, which revealed that over half had difficulties with the transfer process. The responses reflect the problems that the state, universities and two-year colleges have addressed or are working to improve but former and current students say they continue to experience.

When it came to understanding the courses they needed to take to transfer, among 586 respondents, more than 52 percent agreed with Beeman that the process was difficult to understand.

Most current students indicated they had successfully transferred to a four-year university, but nearly half said they had found the transfer process difficult to understand.

More than 700 people responded, with 45 percent identifying as current students and nearly 47 percent as former students.

After his experience, Beeman said his attitude about transfer changed.

“It empowered me to take it into my own hands,” said Beeman who started by reading the detailed transfer agreements between the California community colleges, the California State University system and the UC system.

Beeman said it wasn’t easy. He would compare the agreements to figure out which classes he needed and return to the transfer center to see if they agreed with his assessment. Finally, he was able to put together a plan that worked for him.

Beeman graduated from Fresno City College this spring with plans to attend UC Riverside this fall.

Aisha Lowe, the community college system’s vice chancellor for educational services, said she understands students’ frustrations and confusion with the transfer process. She cited “local authority” that allows individual CSU campuses to determine whether certain associate degrees will be accepted for transfer into their campus.

“It really leaves our students in a position where if they want to be competitive, they end up taking a multiplicity of courses so that they can align to a diversity of requirements across any particular set of university institutions that they’re trying to gain admissions into,” Lowe said.

UC also makes its own rules about transfers and last week declared its opposition to automatically admitting students who complete an “associate degree for transfer,” saying it would leave some students unprepared for their majors because they would enter lacking required courses. CSU has adopted the pathway, and lawmakers are pushing it as a way to ease transfer from community colleges to the nine UC campuses.

Years to transfer

For some community college students, current and former, it’s taken years or even decades to complete their transfer goal. Among current students who took the survey, more than 68 percent reported it’s taking them more than two years to complete their community college degree, with nearly 8 percent of them reporting it’s taking more than four years.

Marvin Espinoza said he found there was little support for working students when he first enrolled in community college in 1991. He would eventually transfer to CSU Dominguez Hills in 1997.

“I was working full-time and going to school at night,” he said. “Most of my classmates relied heavily on each other to keep informed.”

Espinoza, who was also supporting a family while in college, said he ultimately transferred with more than 100 credit hours because, at the time, he had to take a host of remedial classes, which don’t offer credit. The vast majority of remedial education in California’s community colleges was banned only last year when Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1705.

“It was very discouraging,” said Espinoza, who dropped and withdrew from a variety of classes during his community college time while studying child development at LA Southwest. After being placed on academic probation, Espinoza had to appeal to the college that he would gradually pass his classes.

“I wanted to get out of there,” he said, adding that it was his determination and his work within Los Angeles Unified School District to move up the career ladder that encouraged him to get his degree and pursue a transfer. At the time, Espinoza worked as a teaching aide and traveling playground supervisor for the school district.

Now, Espinoza is pursuing his doctoral degree from CSU San Bernardino where he’s working on a dissertation examining the experiences of Black and Latino males’ transitioning to college. Espinoza, who describes himself as Black, said he wants to use his experience to help other men of color earn their degrees.

Most respondents — nearly 77 percent of 648 of them — said they took breaks or dropped out of college for financial, academic, family or work obligations.

It took Arlene Del Bene nearly 40 years, and three community colleges, to eventually transfer to UC Davis. She first enrolled in Hartnell College shortly after graduating from high school in 1979.

“I had always wanted to go to UC, even when I was in high school,” Del Bene said. “I’m a first-generation college student, or at least I was at the time. I was the oldest in my family, but I didn’t know how to get (to UC).”

Del Bene said there wasn’t a road map for transferring. And eventually, other priorities like getting married, having children, and maintaining a job became more important.

Del Bene watched her younger siblings and children attend and graduate from college. But she remained determined to earn a UC degree.

It wasn’t until 2000 that Del Bene enrolled once again at Los Medanos College to try to transfer again. By then she had four children and was working full time. It would be another 15 years before she would transfer to UC Davis in 2015, where she earned her bachelor’s degree in psychology in 2017.

The importance of counseling

Out of 648 respondents, nearly 82 percent reported they had an adviser who guided them in selecting their college courses. And of the 18 percent of respondents who said they didn’t have an adviser, 32 percent said having help would have made the process easier for them.

Mauricio Gonzalez became so disillusioned with California’s transfer process, both as a student and later as a college counselor, that he decided to do something about it: He left his job to launch a tech startup to help students navigate the college experience.

Gonzalez, originally from King City in Salinas Valley, enrolled at Cuesta College in 1994.

A first-generation college student, Gonzalez said he likely would have dropped out if not for Janet Flores, a counselor he met by chance at Cuesta. Flores, who was Latina, helped keep him motivated and eventually became his mentor. Before being introduced to Flores, Gonzalez said he never met faculty or staff “who resembled me” or who understood him.

“She understood why I didn’t really have a goal or a plan. She understood all that, and she took me under her wing and started counseling me,” he said.

When Gonzalez entered college, he didn’t know what he wanted to study but decided on Chicano studies after Flores introduced him to her own undergraduate major.

“Before those classes, I never saw my people in history books. I was only taught white history. We were taught that we are farmworkers, that we are the labor, that we are the cleaners of the home, the construction workers. But those classes changed my life. I now understood systematic racism and discrimination,” he said.

He eventually transferred to Sonoma State University and, drawing inspiration from Flores, would go on to get his master’s degree in counseling at San Jose State.

Since finishing his master’s in 2001, Gonzalez has worked as a counselor at community colleges, most recently at Sacramento City College. But he became discouraged when, as one of 10 counselors, he could only see a maximum of 10 students a day for 30 minutes at a time. It wasn’t enough time with students, and Gonzalez realized that most students aren’t fortunate enough to build relationships with counselors like he did with Flores.

He’s hoping he can make more of an impact with his new company, called Inspirame — or “inspire me” in Spanish. One of its main features is to take information about courses and degree programs and simplify it for students. Students can also find out what financial aid they are eligible to receive.

“I’m going straight to the students and their families. My wife and I said, enough is enough. We left our jobs to revolutionize how people survive higher ed. And I say ‘survive’ because it’s survival,” he said.

Confusing pathways

Confusion over what courses to take also affects students who return to community colleges for advanced training.

Laura Jennings had already had her teaching degree when she moved from Delaware to California with her military husband. But, in order to continue teaching special education in the state, Jennings needed certifications in autism and English as a second language. So, in 2013, she enrolled at Solano Community College near Travis Air Force Base, where her husband was stationed.

“Figuring out which classes to take was difficult and the advisers really had no clue about state licensure or how any of the courses related to what I was trying to accomplish in terms of career movement,” Jennings, 41, said. “That was frustrating.”

Jennings, who worked as a teacher on a provisional license at the time, said she contacted the military veterans representative in Solano County for help and reached out to the state’s teacher credentialing office, which eventually helped her figure out that she needed six autism and eight ESL classes. But Solano’s class schedules required her to take them one at a time, which meant finishing in two years.

“I always did look at the community college and thinking this is the place where you get the lowest cost, and usually you can enroll, do the class, and be done,” she said. “You don’t have to do the huge admissions process of a university, but it’s just really hard to get classes that you want at the time that you want them.”

Jennings learned that she could finish the credentials online in one year at the former nonprofit Brandman University, now UMass Global. Although choosing a private, nonprofit or for-profit institution tends to cost students more than attending a community college, Jennings said she worked as a teacher on a provisional license and her school covered her tuition costs. Jennings said she also didn’t qualify for any financial aid at the community college because she already had a degree and is married.

“Maybe if I was about to get my degree, I would’ve advocated more and said, ‘Hey, we need to change this, it needs to be easier,” Jennings said.

Jennings was among the 5 percent who said they did not complete their program or degree. She ended up becoming a website builder with skills she learned from Google training through Coursera, an open online learning platform that partners with businesses, universities and colleges to provide degrees and certifications.

“I would rather have taken those classes in person, too,” she said. “But the community colleges don’t really offer those accelerated programs that are online.”

A smooth transfer for some

Despite the barriers to transfer, 36 percent of respondents said it was easy for them to understand which courses they needed to take for transfer, of which nearly 8 percent reported it was extremely easy to understand.

A transfer system often described as complex and confusing was anything but that for Alex Moxon, something he attributes to his counselors at Butte College.

Moxon started at the University of Arizona, but after a semester returned to his hometown near Chico and enrolled in 2019 at Butte.

While at Butte, Moxon met regularly with an adviser who helped guide him through his computer science bachelor’s degree.

“When I first showed up for orientation, I met with this adviser and she asked me what my goals were and what I was thinking degree-wise and where I wanted to go. And based on that, she gave me a road map of what classes I needed to take and which ones would transfer to CSU,” Moxon said.

Moxon said he met in person with that adviser every semester. On top of that, he got regular emails from her as she checked in to see how his classes were going and make sure he was staying on track. Once he got to Chico State, he had a similarly positive experience with the computer science faculty, who held workshops and provided him with road maps each semester so he knew what classes to take. He graduated in 2021 and now works for American Express as a software engineer.

His only complaint about the process was having to hand-deliver his transcripts to Chico State after two attempts by mail, a snafu his roommates faced as well.

Tatiana Torres, who was recently accepted as a transfer student to UC Berkley for this fall, also described her experience as mostly positive. She credits this to her assertive nature.

Growing up in Contra Costa County, Torres always dreamed of attending Berkeley. Her aunt, the first in their family to go to college, attended Berkeley. Torres’ dad would also often take her to volleyball games at Berkeley.

After Torres was rejected from most of UC’s campuses when she was a senior in high school, she decided to attend a community college, Los Medanos, and try to transfer to Berkeley.

Torres aimed to finish her classes at Los Medanos within one year, an ambitious but doable goal because she entered with 23 credits from Advanced Placement and dual enrollment classes she took in high school.

Transferring within one year was “really stressful,” said Torres, who took classes last summer and over the winter term. Among the most challenging tasks was making sure she was taking the specific courses she needed for her political science major.

Torres said she would often show up at the transfer center at Los Medanos, ask to meet with counselors and “ask a lot of questions.” She also joined a mentorship program and got paired with a student from Berkeley who had successfully transferred. Torres said she talked to her mentor “all the time” and the two of them worked tirelessly on the essays that Torres submitted as part of her application, which she felt were crucial.

She was ultimately accepted both at Berkeley and at UC Davis and chose to enroll at Berkeley, where she begins classes in August.

“You definitely have to go out, and you have to look for resources and advocate for yourself,” Torres said of the transfer process.

Srinagar, Aug 4 : The signing of a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in February 2020 has once again led to increase in tourist interest in the scenically beautified and serene Kashmiri locations situated in the bordering villages which were prone earlier to arbitrary shelling.

A group of 40 people, including women and children, became the first outsiders to visit the border village of Machil in Kupwara district in north Kashmir from July 16-17.

Machil was earlier known to be shelling prone and therefore, despite its beautiful and eye dropping meadows and ethereal pastures, tourists dithered.

Farah Zaidi Ali, co-founder of the Kashmir off Road (KoR), organised the trip to Machil as per a report by a leading media outlet.

This is a very positive and welcome development. For locals, tourists visiting the Kashmiri offbeat locations closer to the India-Pakistan border is like a dream come true.

People want peace and resuming their business and economic activities without any fear and insecurity. Such areas, notwithstanding lots of tourism potential, did not attract tourists due to frequent and arbitrary shelling.

These areas, which were earlier out-of-bounds for tourists and home to only armed infiltrators or soldiers, are now expecting restoration of usual tourism activities which would spur business opportunities for the locals.

The India-Pakistan border villages have immense potential for eco-tourism. As peace returns, sustainable tourism can not only open the natural beauty of Kashmir to the tourists but also better livelihood opportunities for the locals.

The people in such areas are now just getting mentally prepared how to make the best of this new found opportunity. For instance, people in Teetwal, another such location, believe that the Sharda temple made by Kashmiri pandits and gurdwara in the region could attract tourists given assurance of safe travel and security during the sojourn.

Buoyed by increasing footfalls of tourists in Kashmir, the Jammu and Kashmir government has identified 35 new destinations in the valley, including Gurez and Tulali villages in Bandipora besides Teetwal and Keran.

The Jammu and Kashmir tourism department also aims at adding 50,000 new rooms in Kashmir through the home-stay initiative at 75 new locations across the Union Territory.

According to Sarmad Hafeez, Secretary, J&K Tourism, the J&K Tourism Department has eased the registration process of homestays.

This has been done in view of shortage of homestays with anticipated rise in tourist footfalls as peace is being restored in the UT due to pro-active efforts of the government.

As part of building additional accommodation capacity for tourists, the J&K government is promoting both, homestays and tented accommodation, in the valley.

As revealed by officials, the J&K government would make tented colonies functional at 30 new locations. Besides, 75 offbeat destinations are being developed with proper infrastructure and requisite facilities.

The top offbeat tourist locations include Chatpal, Bangus, Reshwari, Daksum, Karnah, Warwan Valley, Watlab, Gurez and Lolab valley.

Kashmir, the ""paradise on earth"", as the Indians like to call it, is a home of lovely glades and forests.

Its offbeat locations in particular have sights of vast mists rising from rivers curling in thin spirals around the opposite mountains; lovely glades and forests; trees of chinar, pineapple, cedar and somber; and soft air ruffling the water causing pleasant motion among the trees. In the offbeat locations, the visuals of tiny hamlets are enchanting.

Jammu and Kashmir is looking forward to resuscitate its tourism industry as peace and normalcy is being restored in the state. The present government is living no stone unturned.

In December 2020, government announced a package of Rs 1,350 crore ($182.83 million) to boost tourism and other sectors.

There are many things in pipeline to boost tourism in the state and the people of Kashmir are now filled with hope.",Q3
https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/education/2022/08/10/salem-keizer-school-board-approves-concealed-carry-ban-in-4-3-vote/65398035007/,"Salem-Keizer school board approves concealed carry ban, extends restriction to visitors","Visitors to Salem-Keizer Public Schools will no longer be allowed to carry concealed firearms on district property.

Salem-Keizer school board members Tuesday approved a resolution further prohibiting weapons on campus, including concealed guns. The vote directs Superintendent Christy Perry to develop and enact administrative policy to implement this.

The resolution passed on a 4-3 vote, with members Marty Heyen, Danielle Bethell and Satya Chandragiri voting against.

Staff and students were already not allowed to have concealed weapons in Salem-Keizer schools. The new resolution expands restrictions to include all concealed firearms carried by campus visitors, including parents, guardians, volunteers, guest speakers, organizations renting facilities and other community members.

Heyen proposed an amendment before the board voted on the resolution.

Her amendment would have specified that people licensed to conceal carry by the Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training, or DPSST, would be exempt from the change. This includes police, firefighters and private investigators, she said.

The amendment failed with a 3-4 vote against.

There was confusion about whether such an amendment was needed based on the language of the resolution, state law and existing district policies. Perry previously told the Statesman Journal the resolution will not stop law enforcement from carrying on campus.

FAQ:Proposed Salem-Keizer school district concealed carry ban could impact campus visitors

Tuesday night's vote came after much debate and heated exchanges amongst audience members around the resolution and issues on racism. A few testifiers asked audience members to stand if they supported certain student groups, anti-racist efforts and the gun ban.

There were about 100 people in the audience at the start of the meeting. About two-thirds of those in attendance stood.

Several groups left after public comment and after the concealed carry vote.

One parent yelled at the board as she left. Because the members approved the resolution, she said, she would be removing her children from Salem-Keizer, and others would, too.

""You're going to lose students,"" she said. ""You're going to lose funding.”

Adding to existing policy

Prior to Tuesday's vote, Salem-Keizer visitors already could not ""possess, transmit, sell, or in any way dispense a firearm (including look-alikes) or other implement which could be considered dangerous or used as a weapon.""

These rules apply to district properties at all times, not just when school is in session.

Any person found in violation, according to the district's original policy, ""will be subject to referral to law enforcement authorities."" Any person on campus or participating in district-sponsored functions, other than a police officer or person under the authority of a police officer, is subject to the same requirement.

The ability to expand school district policy now is the result of a change in the 2021 legislative session.

Oregon lawmakers passed Senate Bill 554 last year, which expanded the list of public building locations where concealed handguns could be prohibited to include, among others, state universities, community colleges and K-12 schools.

The majority of Oregon's 197 school districts have not opted-in. However, a couple dozen have, including Klamath Falls, Myrtle Point, Tillamook, Pendleton, Tigard-Tualatin, Lake Oswego, Woodburn, and now, Salem-Keizer.

Institutions that choose to be added to the protected group must formally notify the community through signage on all district buildings and messaging on their website.

Salem-Keizer's board first discussed the topic in a June 28 work session and again after the first reading of the proposal on July 12.

Law enforcement and school shootings

For more than two years, there have been tense community debates about Salem-Keizer school resource officers.

Though SRO contracts were ended last year, law enforcement still responds in emergencies and there are district-employed security specialists in the schools. Security specialists are not armed, and they do not handle discipline in terms of referrals to the police.

When previously asked by the Statesman Journal how the weapons ban resolution relates to SROs, Perry said, ""It doesn't.""

Salem-Keizer did not use concealed carry as a way to make schools safer when they contracted SROs, Perry explained. And this resolution won't stop law enforcement in emergency situations. This resolution does not impact the district's existing open carry policies.

""Law enforcement aren't concealed carry. They are trained professionals that have the ability to carry a weapon,"" she said. ""So, if they needed to come on campus, this would never prohibit that. And I think that's an important distinction — that law enforcement is still allowed to carry if they come on campus.""

District officials have assured the public that law enforcement still responds to school emergencies and that the district will continue to implement its threat assessment system, considered a ""gold standard"" nationally.

Some members of the public who spoke against the resolution Tuesday pointed to response times as a reason not to pass it, with one person claiming it would take police 10 minutes or more for them to reach a school in need.

North Salem High School and Parrish Middle School were locked down in May due to a perceived shooter threat. District officials said police responded in 40 seconds.

When asking if there is evidence of a problem with concealed carry holders, especially at schools, proponents have largely said this is a preventative measure. No data showing concealed carry weapons are especially harmful has been presented during the public meetings.

Oregon has had 24 shootings in K-12 schools since 1982, according to data from the Center for Homeland Defense and Security. Its database includes suicides and incidents that occurred on school property such as parking lots but were not during school hours and didn't involve students at the school.

There were incidents involving personal firearms.

For example, in 2019, a Eugene Cascade Middle School parent with a gun was shot by police following a custody dispute. While police escorted the parent from the school during school hours, he pulled out a handgun and police fatally shot him.

And in 2018, a mother accidentally discharged a gun in her bag in the cafeteria at Portland's Jason Lee Elementary School while she was picking up her daughter. There were no injuries, and the woman reportedly left before police arrived.

Some in favor of the additional restrictions have also made the argument that the presence of a gun alone increases the chance a situation could become violent or deadly, rather than safer. Studies cited by the RAND Corporation have found increases in the prevalence of gun ownership are associated with increases in violent crime, though some of the findings are unclear.

Plan as if the policy 'starts immediately'

Now the resolution has passed, Perry and her staff will get the policy work in place.

When interviewed in early August, Perry did not have a specific timeline but said even before the signs are fully installed, they will get information out.

She said the policy will be implemented before the start of the new school year in early September. The district will also update its rental agreement to reflect the change.

""I think people should plan (as if) it starts immediately,"" Perry said, ""and then we'll get the policy and the information out to families and visitors and volunteers.""

https://www.richlandsource.com/area_history/the-day-dillingers-gang-came-to-north-central-ohio/article_89efb426-6771-5ba7-a1c3-9749981ff4c3.html,The day Dillinger’s Gang came to north central Ohio,"GAMBIER — It had been a fairly quiet day, a little warm, growing cloudy.

Alex Ransom was walking down Middle Path through Gambier, on his usual afternoon walk to the post office. A briskly walking man suddenly strode past him, clearly in a hurry. The man stuck out in his suit and long coat, and Ransom didn’t recognize him as a local, especially with his tense manner.

As the brisk walker reached the intersection of Chase Avenue and Brooklyn Street, a big black Chevy car roared past Ransom and screeched to a halt outside the People’s Bank of Gambier, in those days located on the corner of that intersection. The brisk walker crossed the road and got to the sedan just as three well-dressed men hopped out. He joined them as they rushed up the steps into the bank. Another man got out of the car, holding a machine gun, and perched on the Chevy’s running board.

Put Your Hands Up

Inside the bank, banker Ray Brown was preparing to close the books by 2:30 p.m. and lock up the vault. His clerk, Alice Hill, was doing paperwork for a couple of customers. The robbers burst through the front door into the bank lobby, shouting, “Put your hands up!”

While the clerk and customers did so, banker Brown dropped behind the counter and grabbed the revolver he kept for just such a situation. Raising the gun above the counter, he made three blind shots before the big, gray-haired leader of the gang calmly aimed and shot right through Brown’s hand, sending Brown’s gun flying.

With a gun in his other hand, the big guy also kept customer Grant Dwyer, a Kenyon College student, covered.

“I was afraid he’d get his hands mixed up,” Dwyer later quipped to a reporter.

Seeing the car and hearing shots in the bank, the old men that hung out on the bench in front of Frank Hagaman’s hardware store across the street rushed inside to tell Frank. Hagaman grabbed a rifle and quickly set the bench men up with guns. He told them to go down to the basement windows and cover him.

While Hagaman made it outside and behind a tree without getting spotted, the wing man with the machine gun spotted the old fellows lining up at the basement windows of the hardware store and sprayed the building with a burst of machine gun fire. The retirees took cover on the far side of the basement.

In the bank, the heavyset man ordered everyone down on the floor while the other men grabbed $714 out of the drawers at the counter, missing the $5 bill that Alice Hall was clutching in her hand.

With machine gun fire sounding outside, they opted to ignore the vault. The criminals grabbed Brown and pushed him out the door in front of them, then dragged him into the black Chevy as they piled in.

As the car roared west on Brooklyn, Hagaman tried unsuccessfully to shoot out its tires. The gang took a hard left onto Ward, then right on Wiggin Street, nearly running over Reverend Lewis Bailey’s dog.

The Chase

At the bank, mail carrier Frank Armstrong and Kenyon security guard Paul Ralston jumped into Armstrong’s car and followed hot on the robbers’ trail, also nearly hitting Rev. Bailey’s dog. This angered Bailey so much, he jumped in his car and took off after the two reckless vehicles, presumably careful to avoid his dog as he did so.

In the black Chevy, banker Brown looked down at his profusely bleeding hand. The man who shot him looked at it, too.

“You made one mistake buddy, but you’re lucky it turned out OK,” the bank robber said.

At the bottom of College Hill, the robbers crossed onto Glen Road (today Laymon Road) and pushed Brown out of the car as soon as they crossed the bridge over the Kokosing River. They sped off toward the railroad tracks. Armstrong and Ralston, following slightly behind, saw the banker and stopped, but Brown would have none of it.

“Don’t mind me,” he shouted at them, “Go get those ——–!” The newspaper deleted whatever expletive was actually uttered.

As the pursuers started back up, they saw that the robbers had stopped just over the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks (today the Kokosing Gap Trail).

One man jumped out of the car with an automatic rifle. Ralston, who was driving Armstrong’s car, saw what was happening and slammed on the brakes. The two men bailed out of the vehicle into the ditches as bullets went flying, one of them demolishing the speedometer.

Ralston and Armstrong got back in the car and returned to help banker Brown. They took him to the hospital on East High Street in Mount Vernon. The Rev. Bailey, meanwhile, was apprised of the situation, and he opted to follow the gangsters at a safe distance, tracking them across back roads to Sycamore Road before he lost the trail. From there, the gang presumably hit Ohio Route 13 and made quick time exiting the county.

Identities Revealed

Just six days later, headlines were made nationwide when the gang associated with notorious outlaw John Dillinger broke into the Allen County Jail in Lima, Ohio, to break out their colleague. In the process, the gang murdered Allen County Sheriff Jesse Sarber, then went on a new series of bank robberies.

When pictures were circulated in the media, J.R. Brown recognized the mug shot of Dillinger’s right-hand man, Fat Charlie Makley, as the heavyset man with graying hair who had shot him.

While the exact roster for the robbery will never be known (and even eyewitnesses disagreed on whether there were four robbers or five), it seems probable that Makley was the trigger man.

Makley had a cousin in Delaware County who offered the fugitive and his friends a place to lay low, and thus Makley is thought by most crime researchers to have been responsible for the spate of bank robberies in central Ohio during this period. The lookout man on the running board with the machine gun was probably Ed Shouse, who often served in that role.

It may well be that the brisk walker who made sure the coast was clear was the true brains of the gang, Harry Pierpont. Pierpont had been a normal-enough kid growing up in Muncie and Indianapolis, Indiana. After a severe head injury in 1921, however, Pierpont’s personality changed and the 19-year old became a career criminal.

Most historians believe that Pierpont was actually in charge of the gang, deploying Makley and Dillinger to lead certain raids. The FBI attempted to generate tension in the group by telling the media that it was Dillinger’s gang, but Pierpont had no interest in fame and may even have welcomed the deflection of attention to the vain Dillinger.

Less than three months later, Makley and Pierpont were arrested and imprisoned. Dillinger was shot and killed by the FBI in July 1934, ending any hope Makley and Pierpont had of being sprung from the Ohio State Penitentiary, where they were on death row for killing Sheriff Sarber.

On Sept. 22, 1934, the two attempted to break out of prison with fake guns carved from soap and blackened with shoe polish, but the attempt failed. Makley was killed during the attempt, and the severely wounded Pierpont was kept alive just long enough to carry out his death sentence in Ohio’s electric chair.

Banker Brown kept working at the People’s Bank of Gambier until he retired in 1967, and according to local legend, he greatly enjoyed retelling the story of the day he tangled with the Dillinger gang and lived to tell the tale.",Q3

Mayor Adams proposed a social media ban on drill music in a controversial press conference in February. During the conference, Adams explained that his son Coleman sent him drill music videos and found it “alarming.” Adams then suggested that social media sites should ban the subgenre.

In a new interview, Coleman told Complex he texted his father after a press conference and confronted him about his comment suggesting a social media ban on drill music.

“Dad, you cannot speak for me. I have drill rappers on our label as clients, and I like drill music,” Coleman said. “You cannot ban a genre. And I’m not sure why you said what you said, but I disagree.”

According to Coleman, Adams replied, “I understand what you’re saying, and you’re allowed to disagree. We come from different times.”

It turns out that Jordan Coleman, the son of NYC Mayor Eric Adams who recently suggested a ban on drill music, is a rapper. We talked to him. Full interview below ⬇️https://t.co/GwoyEDz5gd — Complex Music (@ComplexMusic) July 28, 2022

Although Coleman thinks it “makes sense” that his father is against people committing crimes and then bragging about it on their songs, he disagrees with banning drill music.

Coleman hopes his father holds more meetings like the City Hall discussion between himself and rappers Fivio Foreign, Maino and B-Lovee, where they can discuss bridging the gap between NYPD and artists.

While the 26-year-old aims to be a liaison between City Hall and the hip-hop scene in New York, he has no plans to become formally involved in his father’s administration at this time.

“Absolutely. This was year one of my dad being mayor and he hasn’t even had a full year yet. It’s been, what? Seven months. So I think he’s definitely going to keep building a strong relationship with these artist,” Coleman said. “As I emerge in the New York rap scene, I’m going to be able to help as well, creating the relationships and being able to bridge the gap between the police and artists.”

“If we were able to sit police officers and hip-hop artists down in the same room, and we were able to really have an honest discussion about this and no one’s getting in trouble from this, I think we would find so much about why there’s a disconnect,” he added. “But because everyone’s living their own life, people have their own motivations. People are stuck in their own rituals, routines, and situations. There’s no allowance for transparency between the two forces.”

Coleman’s desire to create peace between police and artists stems from his own musical pursuits. The artist, also known as Jayoo, has released two albums and works at Roc Nation in the film department.

“As of right now, I’m a creative coordinator for the film department at Roc Nation. It’s pretty cool because I’m really creative for the film department. We go out and find different projects that we can work on, with our clients or for our original content,” Coleman said. “So I’m reading over scripts and meeting different people. I’m really just brainstorming creative ideas to bring to the table for my boss to approve or for us to develop a little bit more.”

Coleman shared that he has been working on his music, and although he wasn’t set on a name yet, he’s tapping into a “brand new galaxy.”

“I don’t have a name for it just yet. Most of my stuff relates to outer space, whether it’s ‘Planet Jensen’ or a space theme,” Coleman said. “So I might be tapping into a brand new galaxy… That might be the name of it, actually. ‘Brand New Galaxy.’ We’re going to go with that one right there. ‘Brand New Galaxy.'”",Q3
https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/27/atlantic_council_china_vuln_research/,China’s infosec researchers may have dodged vuln report ban`,"The number of vulnerability reports provided by Chinese information security researchers has fallen sharply, according to research by think tank The Atlantic Council, which also found a strangely commensurate increase in bug reports from unknown sources.

The Council explored the state of Chinese infosec research in the context of the 2021 introduction of ""Regulations on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities of Network Products"" (RMSV) that require local researchers to report any vulns they find to local authorities. As The Register has reported, the purpose of the regulations may be to allow China's government to stockpile vulnerabilities that could be used for strategic or offensive operations. A ban on Chinese researchers participating in international infosec competitions is thought to have been imposed for similar reasons.

In a paper on the matter titled ""Dragon tails: Preserving international cybersecurity research"", the Council notes that China's infosec researchers are prolific and capable, with Alibaba's detection of the Log4J bug being a prime example of their sterling work.

So nice of China to put all of its network zero-day vulns in one giant database no one will think to break into READ MORE

However the document also notes that Alibaba was sanctioned by Chinese authorities for disclosing the flaw to the Apache Foundation. The Council's team therefore set out to determine whether China's requirements to stem sharing of vulnerability reports is harming the global community.

To do so, researchers looked at bug reports from organizations including Microsoft, Apple, VMware, F5,and Red Hat, as those entities name-check the sources of vulnerabilities they report.

That method found a big drop in vuln reports from China reaching Microsoft, but also ""an increase of similar size and significance in contributions tagged either to individuals, companies with no known country tag, or no acknowledgement at all.""

The Council's researchers hypothesize that could indicate Chinese researchers instead revealed bugs anonymously.

At Red Hat, bug reports from China dropped off well before 2021 and have remained low ever since. The paper's authors believe that may be due to China forking open source projects and spending less time looking at efforts initiated offshore.

One marked trend observed across all vendors and techs was the near disappearance of Chinese security company Qihoo 360 from bug reports just after July 2020 – when the US Department of Commerce added the company to its Entity List of companies to which it applies trade sanctions.

Again, an uptick in anonymized bug reports emerged not long after Qihoo 360 was sanctioned.

The paper concludes that the RMSV has had a measurable impact, and that if similar laws were passed elsewhere it could lead to ""potential isolation of significant subsets of the research community from the larger global supply of vulnerability disclosures.""

""This kind of fear and fragmentation only adds risk to an already difficult to mitigate landscape,"" the paper adds.

The Council therefore calls for action.

""The United States and its allies should see the disclosure of Log4Shell as a call to action to improve the scale and resilience of the global supply of vulnerability disclosure,"" the paper declares. ""Domestic legal changes to improve vulnerability research in single countries are useful, but they are insufficient to address the strategic ramifications of a potential supply shock.""

The authors therefore recommend harmonizing vulnerability disclosure laws to allow cross-border sharing, international investment in open source vulnerability research tools, and tracking disclosure trends to spot gaps. Other suggestions include establishment of international processes that facilitate anonymous vulnerability reporting, and using national bug bounty programs to incentivize research on important software.

The report ends with the optimistic observation that infosec researchers generally behave ethically, as shown by Alibaba's discovery and reporting of Log4J ""in spite of the RMSV and other legal contexts and with no apparent profit motive.""

""That kind of relationship, writ large across the security ecosystem, is one well worth preserving."" ®",Q3
https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/reasons-why-zootopia-is-the-best-recent-disney-animated-movie,5 Reasons Why Zootopia Is The Best Recent Disney Animated Movie,"I know most people would point to Frozen (or Tangled if you're one of the cool kids, since Tangled is better than Frozen) as the movie that jump started Disney's most recent animation Renaissance, and that's fine. I won't disagree with you on that. But, when it comes to Disney's best animated movie in the past 15 years or so, I'm going to have to go with Zootopia, 100%.

Because unlike musicals such as Encanto, or Moana, or Frozen, which have excellent soundtracks to sing-along to, Zootopia is more in the Big Hero 6/Raya and the Last Dragon/Wreck-It-Ralph category in that they mostly have to stand on their stories alone. That said, unlike those aforementioned non-musical animated films, Zootopia stands the tallest out of all of Disney's animated outputs, both musical and non-musical alike, and I have five reasons why.

(Image credit: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)

It Deals With Race Relations And Sexism In A Way That Is Digestible For Children

I once helped write an article about 15 movies that explore race and social justice for this website, and while I didn't include Zootopia (it would have felt out of place considering the other films I wrote about), I do genuinely feel that Zootopia tackles biting issues like racism and sexism in a way that is actually digestible for children.

Let me explain. Our heroine is Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit who dreams of one day becoming a police officer. That said, even though she graduates at the top of her class in police academy, due to her small size and the fact that she's a woman, she is assigned to menial work because the powers that be think she's too fragile to handle dangerous assignments. There's more. In the society of Zootopia, you have the so-called predators living with the prey, which is pretty much a shorthand description of every major city in America.

But, because conflict is necessary in all stories, Judy, who would be deemed as prey, finds herself paired up with a ""predator"" named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) who's a con-artist fox. In Zootopia, all foxes are seen as thieves, and Nick fits the description since he is, in fact, a fox. But, we learn in a flashback that Nick only takes on that con-artist role since society has already assigned it to him since childhood, and in that way, he's become sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

As a black man who has gotten ""You don't act like other Black people"" practically all my life (as if all Black people are supposed to act a certain way), stuff like that resonates with me in a BIG way, and kudos to Disney for even daring to tackle something as touchy as race relations in a children's movie. Bravo.

It Also Deals With The Effects Of Drugs On A Community

It doesn't stop with race relations or sexism, though, since Zootopia also shows the effects of drugs on a community. I'm of course talking about the night howler serum that actually turns animals savage. Don't believe me that Disney would blatantly reference drug use in their children's movie? Well, then what do you make of the Breaking Bad homage in Zootopia's many pop culture references?

In the film, we see a society that is actually falling apart at the seams due to this drug problem, which nobody (including the audience) really knows about until about midway through the film when we find out that the predator mammals aren't just suddenly turning savage out of nowhere, but are instead being drugged and sent into a frenzy. In this way, we're actually getting commentary on how the police force is losing in its battle against drugs, and if that's not smart writing, then I don't know what is.

Its World Is Fully Fleshed Out In A Way That Could Lead To Several Stories

The world of Zootopia is just that - a world. I've discussed how I think Pixar is currently in its golden age with films like Turning Red, and Soul, but Zootopia is that rare Disney Animated film that I actually think goes toe-to-toe with the likes of the expansive world-building of Pixar, as the city of Zootopia truly feels lived in and alive.

And, isn't that what every Pixar movie manages to do? Create life out of the seemingly mundane? Well, Zootopia took something as common as anthropomorphic animals, threw them into a city together, and somehow, they made it feel so alive and fresh that I could envision seeing several different stories being told in this universe. Seriously, I've seen animals walking and talking in cartoons my entire life, but none of them feel as fleshed-out and alive as they do in Zootopia, and that is truly saying something.

And Yet, It Never Got A Sequel, Which Actually Benefits The Film

Unlike Frozen II, or Ralph Breaks the Internet, we only got one Zootopia movie, and I think that makes it feel especially unique. Because, as I mentioned in the last section, the world of Zootopia is vast, and I feel like multiple stories could be told in this universe.

And yet, they weren't. Instead, we got a buddy cop story with an unlikely pairing (as all good buddy cop narratives should be) that is told in one concise story. I've mentioned it before on this site, but Dredd is my favorite comic book movie, and it's mostly because it's just a day-in-the-life tale with little pomp and circumstance, and I feel the same way about Zootopia. Disney could probably milk several more movies out of this universe, and yet, they didn't.

I think that's really great. We're supposed to be getting some Disney+ series called Zootopia+ in the near-future, which I'll definitely check out, but I feel like Disney really could have overdone it with another movie, and I'm glad that they didn't. That makes this single story even stronger because it was just one-and-done.

It's Just An Overall Excellent Story With A Phenomenal Cast

Lastly, Zootopia is just an excellent story, with a phenomenal cast of voice actors, which, aside from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman, also includes Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, and Shakira, just to name a few.

As I already mentioned, the story is just top notch. I love Raya and the Last Dragon and its message that we need to stop judging people by misconceptions that we've already formed about them, but I feel like Zootopia captured a similar message in a way that was actually fun. In comparison, look at a movie like the recent Bad Guys, which our very own Eric Eisenberg called ""Zootopia without the nuance."" By looking at that review, I think you can ascertain just why Zootopia is so great - it actually has nuance! Which is more than I can say for most movies coming out these days, both animated and non-animated alike.

https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2022/09/13/las-vegas-democrat-accused-murdering-journalist-smirks-court-appearance/,Las Vegas Democrat Accused of Murdering Journalist Smirks During Court Appearance,"Robert Telles, the Democrat Clark County administrator accused of killing a Las Vegas Journal-Review investigative reporter, was seen smiling during his court appearance on Tuesday morning.

The 45-year-old Democrat stood in the doorway of the Las Vegas courtroom while smirking during his hearing, KSNV reported. His next court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday, September 20,

Telles was also seen wearing white bandages on his arms which came from his alleged suicide attempt when he slashed his wrists before being taken into custody last week, according to an arrest report via the Daily Mail.

Telles is also suspected of having taken drugs before he was apprehended.

The Democrat official was charged last week in connection with the murder of Jeff German, 69, who was found dead outside his home with multiple stab wounds on September 3.

“Police said in a press conference that Telles’s DNA was found at German’s murder scene and thus charged him with the fatal stabbing. Police also said they found a pair of bloody sneakers and a hat worn by Telles at the time of the murder,” Breitbart News reported last week.

German had been investigating and exposing Telles’s corruption in the public administrator’s office.

Telles recently lost his reelection following German’s investigations. The journalist was planning a follow-up piece on the 45-year-old and other Clark County officials.

Part of the investigations into Telles and the other three Clark County officials include hostile work environments and an inappropriate relationship with a colleague, according to the Review-Journal.

Telles had responded to the investigations by calling German a “bully” on Twitter.

The Clark County administrator is still receiving paychecks while he is in prison as he has not officially left his role yet. He currently makes a salary of $130,000 per year.

German had covered crime and corruption in Las Vegas for over 40 years and was regarded as one of the Review-Journal’s most respected journalists.

A witness in the Jan. 6 probe said Ornato described a clash between Trump and his security detail.

Ornato retired after 25 years with the Secret Service under five presidential administrations.

WASHINGTON – A former White House aide to Donald Trump who was a central figure in explosive testimony about the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, retired Monday from the Secret Service.

Anthony Ornato, who served as Trump’s deputy chief of staff for operations while also a top Secret Service official, retired after 25 years with the agency, according to agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“I long-planned to retire and have been planning this transition for more than a year,” Ornato, the former assistant director for the office of training, said in a statement to Politico.

Ornato’s retirement comes as the House committee awaits his additional testimony about an incident involving Trump before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

A former Trump aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, testified that Ornato told her after Trump’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, that the president tried to grab the steering wheel in his vehicle and lunged for the chief of his Secret Service security, Robert Engel, in order to join the mob at the Capitol rather than return to the White House.

Hutchinson said Ornato described the incident while Engel was in the room with them and Engel didn’t correct the story.

“Mr. Engel grabbed his arm, said, ‘Sir, you need to take your arm off the steering wheel,’” Hutchinson testified. “’We’re going back to the West Wing. We’re not going to the Capitol.’ Mr Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel and when Mr. Ornato recounted this story for me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.”

Ornato and Engel, who each cooperated with the committee before the June hearing, reportedly wanted to testify again to clear up potential disputes with Hutchinson’s testimony.

Guglielmi said the Secret Service has cooperated with the investigation and made officials available for testimony. It will be up to Ornato to decide whether to testify.

“Certainly when he was an employee of the service, he had all intentions of testifying,” Guglielmi said. “Now that he’s a private citizen working for another organization, you’re going to have to check with him on if that still stands.”

A committee spokesman declined comment on Ornato’s retirement.

Ornato joined the Secret Service in 1997 and served under five presidential administrations. Before joining the White House in 2019, Ornato served as deputy assistant director of the Secret Service’s office of investigations. He previously served in the presidential protective division during the George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations.",Q3

The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority accused Khan of hurling “baseless” allegations and threats against state institutions and government officials.

The action came hours after Khan’s speech in Islamabad about his adviser, Shahbaz Gill, who is on trial for allegedly inciting mutiny in the armed forces. Khan’s PTI party accuses police of torturing him to obtain a statement against the former premier.

The government and police have denied the charge.

“WHEREAS, it has been observed that Mr. Imran Khan, Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, (PTI) in his speeches/statements is continuously alleging state institutions by levelling baseless allegations and spreading hate speech through his provocative statements against state institutions and officers which is prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order and is likely to disturb public peace and tranquillity, ” said a statement from Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority.

It said the chairman PEMRA “in view of the above mentioned background and reasons, hereby prohibits broadcast of live speech of Mr. Imran Khan on all satellite TV channels with immediate effect.”

However, recorded speeches would be permitted to be aired only after an “effective delay mechanism is put in place in order to ensure effective monitoring and editorial control in conformity with PEMRA laws,” it said.
