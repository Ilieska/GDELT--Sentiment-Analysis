http://www.stripes.com/news/report-criminal-charges-dropped-against-officer-in-urination-video-case-1.239750,Report: Criminal charges dropped against officer in urination video case,"A video posted on YouTube purports to show U.S. Marines urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters. A Corps spokesman said the matter is under investigation. ()

The Marine Corps has dropped criminal charges against an officer accused in connection with a YouTube video showing Marines urinating on dead Taliban fighters, the Marine Corps Times reports.

Capt. James V. Clement, the only officer criminally charged in the case, instead will face a Board of Inquiry that will determine an administrative punishment, the website said. He's accused of ""substandard performance of duty, misconduct, and moral or professional dereliction.""

Clement was the executive officer for Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment out of Camp Lejune, N.C., in July 2011, when the incident occurred.

The controversial 39-second video, posted on YouTube in January 2012, shows four enlisted Marines in combat gear urinating on the corpses of dead insurgents in Musa Qala, Afghanistan. One Marine could be overheard saying to one of the bodies, ""Have a good day, buddy.""

Clement is not seen in the YouTube video but faced charges of dereliction of duty, violation of a lawful general order, making false statements to an investigator and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman for failing to supervise junior Marines, failing to stop the misconduct of junior Marines and failing to report misconduct.

He was scheduled for November court-martial, the Marine Corps Times said. Clement's civilian lawyer told the website it was frustrated the Marine Corps was dropping the charges for administrative punishment.

""This is sore losing. This is not classy, and it doesn’t stand with the excellence the Marine Corps is known for,"" John Dowd said.

It triggered outrage in Afghanistan and concern in the U.S. that it could turn Afghans against Americans and serve as a recruiting tool for the Taliban.

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/army-general-expected-enter-plea-bargain-new-york-times-reports/,"Army general expected to enter plea bargain, New York Times reports","An Army general has reportedly agreed to enter a guilty plea as early as Monday in a move that could end a high profile sexual assault case that has plagued the military for the past two years, according to a report from the New York Times on Sunday.

Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair, who was the deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, will reportedly have some of the charges brought by his mistress of three years dismissed in lieu of the plea bargain.

According to the New York Times, the charges to be dismissed include threatening her family, forcing her to perform oral sex twice in Afghanistan and performing consensual “open and notorious sexual acts.”

Officials had announced on Friday that a new hearing for the married general would be set for Monday, March 17 at Fort Bragg. The trial had previously been postponed to allow for potential plea negotiations.

Prosecutors will likely push for General Sinclair to receive prison time. The defense is expected to cite that in similar cases sentencing did not include jail time. They will also emphasize that he will retire at a lower rank, taking a retirement pay cut of more than $1 million.

The case against General Sinclair took a hit earlier this year when the prosecution determined the chief witness — the general’s mistress and a captain in the military — potentially lied in a pretrial hearing while under oath.

In February his lawyers filed a motion to have sexual assault charges dropped, for which he would face life in prison if convicted.

Judge Col. James Pohl, who is presiding over the case, decided against dismissing the charges, but instead allowed the defense team another chance at a plea deal.",Q1
http://www.khaama.com/suicide-attack-organizers-blown-up-by-own-explosives-in-kandahar-3456,Suicide attack organizers blown up by own explosives in Kandahar,"A group of suspected suicide attack organizers were blown up by own explosives in southern Kandahar province of Afghanistan.

The incident took place late Friday in Shahwali Kot district while the suspected militants were busy with plotting a suicide attack.

Interior Ministry of Afghanistan following a statement said Saturday that the suspected militants had gathered in a residential house in Torbagh village.

The statement further added that the explosion took place around 4 pm local time while the militants were busy plotting the suicide attack.

Interior Ministry confirmed a suicide bomber was killed along with a kid and two other terrorists following the explosion.

In a separate operation, Afghan national security forces discovered and seized 8 barrels of explosives from Shahwali Kot district, interior ministry said.

The explosives were stored by militants to carry out insurgency attacks in Kandahar province.

During Peaceful Eid al-Adha Speech Inside Mosque [RAW FOOTAGE] Gov. Fails To Cheat Death Following Several Unsuccessful Assassination Attempts,"A microphone bomb killed an Afghanistan provincial governor during his peaceful delivery of a speech Tuesday, commemorating the Eid al-Adha holiday. The bombing is allegedly part of the campaign aimed at intimidating the national government in the upcoming elections as well as an outcry to withdraw foreign troops that have been staying in Afghanistan for more than 12 years now.

The bomb used was said to have been planted inside the microphone inside a mosque at the capital of Puli Alam, where Logar province governor, Arsallah Jamal, was delivering his speech to attending worshippers, who were there to commemorate the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, New York Post reported.

The explosion of the microphone bomb, which is now considered as the highest profile assassination in recent months, had also injured 15 other people, with five still in critical condition, Spokesman Din Mohammad Darwesh said.

Officials believe that the main target in the microphone bomb assassination was 47-year-old Jamal, who has reportedly survived numerous assassination attacks in the past including a handful of suicide bombings.

In May and July 2009, Jamal reportedly survived the bombings that had happened inside his Khost office. Meanwhile, he also managed to cheat death in a suicide car bomb attack in his August 2007 convoy.

According to reports, Jamal was actually a close confidant and adviser of Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who had said the same day that the bombing was an attack ""against Islam.""

Thus far, no group has claimed responsibility over the microphone bomb assassination, but it is said to bore the hallmarks of the Taliban, which is said to be against Karzai's administration for some time now. The Taliban is also reportedly denouncing the presence of foreign military in the country since late 2001.

""Terrorists and the Taliban working in the name of Islam carry out attacks that result in the killing of innocent Muslims,"" Karzai said, adding, ""Surely it is not the act of Muslims, but those who have been hired to kill Muslims.""

Reports said debris was scattered around the mosque while blood from the victims splattered on the marble walls following the explosion of the microphone bomb.

In the past, sophisticated explosives have been planted against government officials such as bombs hidden in turbans and even those strategically planted inside suicide bombers' bodies.",Q1

After 24 years on the job, Abdul Saboor had been deemed the most honest man in Afghanistan. He posed for photos with the interior minister. He gave interviews to local newspapers. Then he went back to the five-room home he shares with 28 people.

Saboor, 52, might be a better symbol for the sacrifices that an honest man must make in Afghanistan to follow the law. In two decades, he has received only one minor promotion. His salary, unaided by bribes, is $200 per month. His toes are black after being run over several times. His throat is perpetually sore from Kabul’s dust and pollution, but he struggles to afford medicine or hospital visits.

Afghanistan is the world's most corrupt nation (tied with North Korea and Somalia), according to Transparency International. It's a country where public officials have embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars, most of it foreign aid, and where petty corruption pervades daily life.

Although Western donors have funded anti-corruption programs and agencies, many Afghan institutions not only tolerate corruption but implicitly encourage it. Saboor has become a famous figure, but few Afghans are likely to follow his example.

""If they don't take bribes, they will suffer like Saboor,"" said Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam, chairman of the Anti-Corruption Network, an Afghan watchdog that joined with other civil-society groups to bestow the award last month.

To see Saboor in action in Kabul’s Sherpur traffic circle is to understand why he came to the government’s attention. While his colleagues take frequent breaks and look for ways to extort drivers, Saboor leaps in front of cars that try to charge past his stop sign and blows his whistle at those threatening to accelerate before their turn.

In a city with poor roads and more than a million cars, where traffic lights were installed and promptly ignored, Saboor is famous for both his incorruptibility and his theatrics. He’s known to thousands of Afghans as “Uncle Traffic” or “Uncle Saboor.”

He has received commendations from Taliban ministers and former presidents. International organizations have joined in, too: The United Nations, attempting to boost public confidence in the Afghan police, funded a short documentary about him last year.

His biggest fans, though, are Kabul drivers, several of whom nominated him as the country’s most honest man. Often, they slow their vehicles to greet Saboor by name.

“He’s the only honest traffic police in Afghanistan,” said Abdul Hussen Sadeq, a taxi driver.

“All the rest are like dogs,” said Hasibullah, another taxi driver, who uses only one name. “Every day they ask us for bribes. If we don’t pay, they take our licenses.”

As the government of President Hamid Karzai enters its final months, Saboor is happy to accept another superlative. But he doesn’t expect it to change a system of institutionalized corruption. Ask him how Afghanistan has changed since the Taliban, and he won’t speak about the growth of democracy.

“Now,” he says, “there are a lot more cars.”

A complex problem

Saboor knows as well as anyone how you make money as a traffic police officer. You accept bribes instead of giving tickets. For a price, you allow trucks to be driven in restricted areas of the city. You charge drivers to park on the street, even where parking is free and legal.

As for promotions at work, they are often purchased.

For his colleagues, these are common practices.

“We aren’t as morally strong as Saboor,” said Lt. Atta Mohammad, who works at the same roundabout. Like other police officers interviewed, Mohammad said he did not accept bribes.

Saboor sees each bribe as an ethical lapse and a reflection of the state’s frailty.

But for many Afghans, as well as foreign academics and analysts, corruption is a complex problem, rooted in the country’s social structure and aggravated by weak institutions and decades of war. The impoverished country has traditionally had strong patronage networks, which in the past paved the way for some corruption, but the practice expanded as foreign aid flooded in.

“People have no confidence in the future. They fear the return of a dark era. In order to protect themselves and their families financially, they collect bribes,” said Hamdam of the Anti-Corruption Network.

He said fear — as well as the instinct for self-preservation, sharpened by so many hard years — has eroded a once-valued moral code.

Hamdam said the problem has worsened over the past decade as “weak and corrupt leaders” ascended to power. In parts of the country, corruption has led to discontent with the central government, galvanizing support for the Taliban. Many say that the Taliban government ousted by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in 2001 was more transparent than the current leadership, though often horribly brutal.

‘I would never quit’

With Western funds, the government created the biggest police force in Afghan history, including hundreds of officers charged with directing traffic in the biggest cities. But last fall, Integrity Watch Afghanistan, an independent watchdog, found that 59 percent of Afghan police officers were extorting money at tollbooths or checkpoints.

An anti-corruption unit within the police force, created in 2012, has issued only a handful of convictions, Afghan officials said. Some police officers don’t even associate demanding bribes with corruption; rather, they consider it their right as underpaid government employees dealing with the soaring cost of living in a war economy.

The leaders and institutions that would crack down on graft often benefit from the practice themselves. In some high-profile corruption cases, such as that of national security adviser Mohammad Zia Salehi, suspects have been absolved by Karzai or other senior officials.

So, why hasn’t Saboor accepted his place in the patronage system? He points to his childhood.

His father was killed in a traffic accident — an incident that he considers an example of the need for effective traffic police. His two uncles were traffic policemen, wearing crisp uniforms and reporting to a stable job every day, even as the country imploded.

Saboor saw the way pedestrians, especially children, responded when he ran frantically across Kabul intersections, blowing his whistle to stop rule-flouting drivers or kicking his legs up and patrolling like a guard at Buckingham Palace.

“They started coming just to watch me,” he said. “The kids would scream ‘Uncle Saboor’ or ‘Uncle Traffic.’ Drivers stopped to say thank you. Everyone knew about me.”

In the early 90s, when the government learned about the ‘incorruptible’ traffic police officer, President Burhanuddin Rabbani offered Saboor a plot of land for his family as a reward. But Saboor said he ran into continuous bureaucratic delays and is still fighting to claim the land, 20 years later. He says it’s unclear whether a bribe — which he’s unwilling to offer — would have expedited the process.

When he asked superiors for a promotion, “nothing ever happened,” he said, sitting in the home he shares with his four children and about two dozen brothers, cousins, uncles and aunts. “But I still loved my job. I would never quit.”

When the Taliban seized power, its leaders, too, heard about Saboor. Ministers came by his intersection with new clothes, new turbans and a new bicycle. Despite the long list of abuses perpetrated by the Taliban, Saboor said he felt the group respected his commitment to public service. It’s more than he can say for the government that followed.

“Now the VIPs think they can break all the rules,” he said. “They drive in their armored cars wherever they want, even if they’re breaking the law.”

Saboor sometimes sees Karzai’s motorcade as it whizzes through his roundabout. He salutes the armored vehicles with tinted windows, hoping that the president might see him.",Q1

Read our privacy policy

David Cameron said on Sunday night he was in Kazakhstan to “secure jobs back home”, as he put concerns over human rights behind a bid for billions of pounds of new investment at the start of his controversial visit to the Central Asian republic.

The Prime Minister suggested that he would raise Kazakhstan’s treatment of its own people during a meeting with President Nursultan Nazarbayev, as he arrived at Atyrau, the oil hub on the Caspian Sea coast.

Pressure groups have been calling on Mr Cameron to challenge the Kazakh leader over “credible allegations” of abuses including torture, repression of the media and religious freedoms dating back over 15 years.

But he insisted that Britain’s business interests would be at the top of his agenda throughout his brief trip to one of the fastest-growing oil-producers in the world.

“I always raise all these issues with all the partners that we have around the world,” the Prime Minister told the BBC as he arrived for a helicopter tour around the Kashagan offshore oil field. “But let me be clear, why am I in Kazakhstan on a Sunday? We are in a global race for jobs and investment. I have more than 30 British businesses with me and we hope to sign £700m-worth of new deals. That will mean jobs back at home and also investment in this rapidly growing economy. That’s what this is about.”

Mr Cameron has been under increasing pressure over meeting President Nazarbayev, who has been in control of Kazakhstan for more than 20 years. Amnesty International yesterday challenged the Prime Minister to tell the President that he would not “turn a blind eye” to his regime’s behaviour. Amnesty’s UK head of policy and government affairs, Allan Hogarth said: “Kazakhstan might be knee-deep in oil and gas wealth, but David Cameron shouldn’t let lucrative energy deals prevent him from raising human rights.”

The Prime Minister is the first ever serving British PM to visit Kazakhstan and the Government believes the returns could amount to a total of £85bn in the coming years. Downing Street said Mr Cameron was determined to link British businesses up to emerging markets as part of efforts to ensure Britain succeeds against tough global competition.

Earlier, Mr Cameron promised to “stand together” with Pakistan in the fight against terrorism following talks with his newly elected counterpart Nawaz Sharif, on the second leg of his whistle-stop tour of the region.

The Prime Minister said the battle required “tough and uncompromising” action but also efforts to combat the roots of extremism and radicalisation. On Saturday, during a visit to Kabul, Mr Cameron had urged Pakistani leaders to recognise that a stable Afghanistan was in their “short, medium and long-term interests”.",Q1

He said the state negotiation team also reflected Nawaz’s lack of seriousness.“If I was him, I would lead it myself; it’s too important an issue for Pakistan,” he said.Commenting on why the TTP named him as a negotiator from their side, Imran boasted that they trust him to withstand US pressures.Stressing that he disagrees with TTP’s interpretation of Sharia law, Imran said “clearly, I don’t represent Taliban.”",Q1

Talking to media persons here after attending National Water Summit 2014, said the government was working on water policy to address its scarcity in the country. Pakistan is not getting 10 million acres feet water from its due share due to the water stoppage by India, which should be investigated thoroughly, he added.

Pakistan Water Summit 2014 was convened by the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms in collaboration with the Ministry of Water and Power, Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination and Ministry of National Food Security and Research for formulating the country’s first National Water Policy.

Addressing the National Water Summit 2014, the federal minister said water crisis could further worsen if the current water situation persisted, adding population was rising rapidly and the government could not close eyes on this issue.

He warned the water security was reminiscent to the national security as malnutrition could create national security crisis in the country. “Pakistan can store 40 percent of water, but unfortunately we are only storing 7 percent of it,” he revealed.

“Energy policy in the last decade triggered an energy crisis which is causing sufferings to the people besides threatening food security, economy, and development. Now, if we fail to formulate and implement an effective water management policy, it will lead towards a disaster. Our goal is to ensure energy, water and food security through timely action,” said the federal minister for planning, development and reforms.

“In 1947, the water availability in Pakistan was 5,650 cubic meter per person, which kept on decreasing, first, due to Indus Water Treaty, 1960, giving away 33 MAF water of three eastern rivers to India, secondly, gradual decline in trans-boundary flows into Pakistan which has been alarmingly up to the tune of 10.25 MAF, and, thirdly, exceptional growth in population of the country, all making per capita water availability in Pakistan to as low as 964 cubic meters per year which is creating water deficit and hampering our well being and, at the same time, severely affecting future economic development. Trans-boundary water issues with India and Afghanistan have to be resolved in a win-win mode to ensure regional stability and prosperity. We will work with the provinces to achieve the national goals.” said the minister

“The situation is aggravating due to our excessive reliance on underground water which is meeting more than 60% of agriculture needs. It is not only resulting in salinity but also contamination of aquifers with heavy traces of fluoride and arsenic. Climate change is also expected to have extreme effects on the glaciers which contribute over 70% of our water resources and may reduce the water availability by 30% to 40%. Furthermore, our productivity per unit of water and land is one of the lowest in the world. In USA and Australia per capita storage is 6,150 cubic meters and 5,000 cubic meters, respectively, whereas Pakistan’s storage capacity is only 132 cubic meters per person. Our neighbors, India and China, have reduced the substantial amount of water usage in agriculture sector and have enhanced productivity manifold. Pakistan’s productivity per unit of water is 0.13kg/m3 only, one-thirds of India’s and one-sixths of China’s. Similarly, Pakistan’s productivity per unit of land is one-thirds of Egypt’s, half of Saudi Arabia’s and half of India’s. Increasing productivity in water use is critical for our future development. Pakistan’s Vision 2025 assigns the highest priority to water resources and seeks a nexus of energy, water and food to ensure that we follow an integrated and holistic approach in development planning,” the minister asserted.

He further said, “Our approach is not planning for the sake of planning; we seek to minimise the gap by focusing on implementation and delivery. Water is a fundamental right of every citizen and it is responsibility of the state to ensure supply of clean drinking water to citizens.”

Addressing the summit, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Tariq Fatemi said talks were held between Pakistan and India over water issue and Indus Water Basin Treaty is still intact, which will help both the countries resolve the issue peacefully. He said the PML-N government wanted peace at home and peaceful negotiations with the neighboring countries. including India. He suggested to the forum to find out ways to make water an instrument of enhancing cooperation instead of bone of contention between India and Pakistan.

The Summit was attended by many foreign and national dignitaries, including Federal Minister for National Food Security and Reseach Sikandar Hussain Boson, Federal Minister for Inter-provincial Coordination Riaz Pirzada, Shamsul Mulk, Stephen Davis, Shakeel Durrani, Ashfaq Mahmood, Shahid Ahmed, Imtiaz Gillani, Arun Sherestha, delegates from the World Bank, UNO, USAID, AusAID and institutions like Global Water Partnership, Lead, IFPRI and ICI MOD.",Q1

US-Pakistan ties have been under strain since May 2011, when Navy SEALs swooped down on a compound in Abbottabad and killed Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.?The killing of two Pakistani men by CIA contractor Raymond Davis and a US air raid that killed 28 Pakistani soldiers further strained relations. The relationship will enter a critical phase in 2014 when Washington withdraws most of its combat troops from Afghanistan. The Pakistani security establishment has claimed that India will fill up the vacuum created by the withdrawal. Pakistan claims India is using Afghan territory for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, a charge denied by New Delhi. On the other hand, India is wary of Pakistan`s role in post-2014 Afghanistan, especially the military`s links with militant groups like the Haqqani network, as it believes this will give Islamabad impetus for re-starting the Kashmir jihad. As Foreign Secretary, Jilani accompanied Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif twice to the US - in September to attend the UN General Assembly and in October for a summit meeting between Sharif and President Barack Obama. He also visited the US with former Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar and attended key meetings with American leaders. Jilani also served at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington during 1995-99, before a stint in New Delhi.",Q1

20 AUGUST 2013 | KAPISA, AFGHANISTAN

A unique exercise is underway at Alberoni University in Afghanistan’s Kapisa province. A small demonstration plot has been prepared and 170 agriculture students are being trained in modern farming techniques. It is part of USAID’s Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives for the North, East and West (IDEA-NEW) program to update the students’ knowledge and skills and compensate for the lack of practical training at most Afghan universities.

The training is especially important for these students, nearing the end of their undergraduate careers. Many of them will eventually find work in government agriculture departments and will be responsible for training local farmers. It is consequently essential for them to know proper land preparation, sowing and planting techniques, integrated pest management and post-harvest best practice.

Shareefullah, a third-year student, said the training was invaluable. “They demonstrate efficient irrigation and minimizing the quantity of seeds used. There is a better harvest because of integrated pest management techniques.”

Gardez, who is in his last year of college, says he regrets not having received “such training throughout my university course.”

Alberoni University’s Dean of Agriculture, Fazl ul Rab Arya, says it is the first time his students are exposed to new agricultural techniques. He describes the demonstration plot, measuring one jerib (the traditional Afghan unit that equals 2,000 square meters) as a “sustainable source of knowledge for the students.”

Another demonstration plot will be established at Nangarhar University in Jalalabad. IDEA-NEW also plans to provide current textbooks and laboratory equipment to both universities as well as to the agricultural department of Kabul University.",Q1
http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/46983/,"‘Article 226 makes it clear that all elections, except for PM and Ms, would be held by secret ballot’","ISLAMABAD (APP): The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday adjourned hearing in a presidential reference seeking opinion on open balloting for the upcoming Senate elections till Thursday.

A five-member larger bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mushir Alam, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi heard the reference.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, while continuing his arguments, said the Constitution did not mention the procedure for the election of NA speaker and deputy speaker and Senate chairman and deputy chairman.

The house officials conducted the elections where the Constitution did not specify the procedure, he said. The outgoing speaker served as returning officer for the election of the next one, he added.

He said the elections whose procedure was stipulated in the Constitution, would be considered under the Constitution.

The Constitution called for the creation of national and provincial assemblies, he added.

Justice Ijaz observed that the court understood the crux of his argument that the Constitution called to form offices and bodies, but the method of their election was in the law not in the Constitution.

The AGP said the offices of national and provincial assemblies were not constituted under the Constitution but under the law. The Constitution provided their composition, but laws and acts had been made for their elections, he added.

He said the duration of the parliament, the modus operandi, the number of sittings, etcetera were stated but the Constitution did not specify the procedure for the elections.

He said only the number of elected representatives was mentioned in the Constitution, but laws and acts were made for their election by the constituents.

The AGP said the number of special seats for women and minority and full composition of the parliament were provided in the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz asked how the elections were held for the women reserved seats.

The AGP replied that women seats were allocated by the winning ratio of the political parties. It was written in the Constitution that the National Assembly (NA) elections were held under the law, he added.

Addressing the AGP, the CJP said according to him (AGP) the NA elections were held by law.

Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan said the Act 2017 called for elections by secret ballot.

The AGP said Article 59 provided the composition of the Senate. The word act was also used for women in the Senate, he added.

He said direct votes and constituencies had been mentioned for the NA but direct elections were not mentioned for the Senate.

Justice Bandial said the formal procedure for the election of NA members was given in the law but not for the Senate.

The AGP said the procedure for Senate elections was different as members of provincial assemblies proposed the candidates for the Senate. Independent candidates could also participate in the Senate elections, he added.

Justice Ijaz said the members of the provincial assemblies should be allowed to exercise their votes freely.

The attorney general said elections of Senate chairman, deputy chairman, prime minister and the chief ministers were not clear in the Election Commission and the Election Act. Article 60 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the Senate chairman, he added.

Justice Ijaz said Articles 53 and 60 of the Constitution did not mention that there would be open ballot elections or secret elections.

The attorney general said the elections of the NA speaker and Senate chairman would be held through secret balloting under the Article 266.

He said it was clear in the Constitution that the outgoing NA speaker would conduct the election of the speaker. The first task of the elected assembly would be the election of the speaker, he added.

He said the elections of the prime minister, NA speaker and Senate chairman were not conducted under the Election Act.

He said the parliament itself conducted the elections of the prime minister, Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.

He said Article 53 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the speaker but Senate and NA elections were not held under the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz said Article 226 made it clear that all elections, except for the prime minister and the chief ministers, would be held by the secret ballot.

The AGP said the chapter on elections held under the law was different.

The Article 226 did not apply to every election, he added.

The chief justice said if Article 226 applied, the elections for reserved seats could not take place.

He said elections for the national and provincial assemblies were held under the law.

The attorney general said all laws were framed in accordance with the Constitution.

He said political parties submit lists for representation on reserved seats.

He said an independent candidate could contest the Senate election if he was nominated and proposed by a member of the provincial assembly.

Justice Ijaz said if any member of the provincial assembly wanted to vote against the party, he should use open balloting.

The attorney general said generally people considered election only on voting day but the election machinery was also part of the voting process. Elections were not just about voting as it had many stages, he added.

He said constituency elections, preparation of voter lists, delimitation, nomination papers, voting schedule, voting and results were all the stages.

The chief justice said those were the stages of direct elections.

The attorney general said whether there was an assembly or not, the president could issue an ordinance related to the elections.

He said the Senate Election Act of 1975 also laid down the procedure for holding Senate elections.

He said elections under the law could not be challenged but only elections held under the statute could be challenged in tribunals.

Justice Ijaz said elections under the law could be challenged under the Constitution.

The attorney general said the vote of an ordinary citizen was free but the vote of a member of provincial assembly (MPA) given to a senator was not free.

When the MPA’s vote for the Senate could not be free, then the ballot could not be secret, he added.

Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan said it was unwise to vote for another senator by secret ballot in violation of party discipline.

The MPA violating party discipline should have moral courage to openly say that he had voted against the party discipline, he added.

Upon this, Justice Bandial said this was moral, not legal. The MPA had the right to vote according to his will, he added.

The chief justice said the courts were the guardians of the Constitution.

Justice Yahya Afridi addressing the AGP said his argument was moral in nature and the matter was political.

He said the question raised in the presidential reference was legal and ethical but the matter was political.

He asked the attorney general that his case was based on ethics while the issue was political.

He asked why the government was seeking the opinion of the court instead of approaching the parliament?

The attorney general said the government had only approached the SC for an opinion.

If the opinion of the SC was in government’s favour, the final decision was to be taken by the parliament, he added.

He said the SC had given its opinion on the NA’s resolution regarding recognizing Bangladesh.

Justice Afridi said the AGP’s argument regarding Bangladesh was correct.

The attorney general said he could give eleven examples of cases in which the court ruled despite the presence of political aspects.

He said the apex court disqualified politicians by interpreting the law in dual citizenship cases.

He said the issue of disclosure of assets of parliamentarians was political but the SC also interpreted the law on it.

The government had come to the SC to stop the sale and purchase of votes and for transparency, he added.

Justice Ijaz asked the AGP whether he was just asking the court to interpret the Article 226 only?

The attorney general responded that he could not put it more simply.",Q1
http://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/high-level-meeting-kabul-commitments-renewed-cooperation-future-afghanistan,"At high-level meeting in Kabul, commitments renewed for cooperation on future of Afghanistan - Afghanistan","3 July 2013 – At a high-level meeting in the Afghan capital of Kabul, today, the Government of Afghanistan and international donors reaffirmed their mutual commitments to work together to help the country through its ongoing security, political and economic transitions.

“Today, we jointly reconfirm both our confidence that Afghanistan and its people supported by the international community will successfully sail through the troubled waters of the intertwined security, political and economic transitions into the stabilizing ‘Transformation Decade’ and our mutual commitment to work together supporting each-other for Afghanistan’s peaceful, stable and prosperous future,” said the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, Ján Kubiš, in his remarks to the opening of the so-called Senior Officials’ Meeting.

Along with the Afghan Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Finance, Zalmai Roussol and Omar Zakhilwal, Mr. Kubiš was one of the meeting’s co-chairmen.

The gathering was a follow-up to a conference in Tokyo last year, which brought together representatives of 70 countries and international organizations to chart out future assistance for Afghanistan to meet its economic and development needs through the ongoing transitions and during the so-called Transformation Decade of 2015-2024.

The conference in the Japanese capital – which led to agreement on a “a new reinvigorated development partnership” between the Government of Afghanistan and the international community in the form of the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF) – was held amidst fears within Afghanistan that international support to the country may wane after the majority of foreign combat troops leave the country in 2014.

The withdrawal of the majority of allied international military forces, with national forces assuming full responsibility for security throughout the country, coincides with a major development on the political front, namely, the holding a presidential election in early 2014.

In Tokyo, donors ended up pledging $16 billion through 2015 for the country’s economic and development needs, while Afghanistan made commitments in five main areas: representational democracy and equitable elections; governance, human rights and rule of law; integrity of public finance and commercial banking; government revenue, budget execution and sub-national governance; inclusive and sustained growth and development.

Addressing a joint news conference later today, Foreign Minister Roussol said the international community’s participation in the meeting showed “their common will for supporting Afghanistan and ensuring a bright future for the people of this country.”

“It is very important that the [international] assistance is delivered in accordance with the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework and the Afghan Government’s priorities through the national budget in order to make the assistance more effective,” Finance Minister Zakhilwal told the news conference.

Addressing the same journalists, the UN Secretary-General’s Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, Mark Bowden, said the Senior Officials Meeting had led to “far deeper dialogue” between the donor community and the Afghan Government.

“Meeting today,” Mr. Bowden said, “provided a strong forward framework and commitments to take TMAF forward, and to focus on particular areas so that we can move into the transformation decade smoothly and maintain Afghanistan’s progress towards sustainable development.”

A joint statement issued after the Kabul meeting said the participants encouraged the Afghan Government and the international community to continue efforts to meet commitments under TMAF to help improve the lives of the Afghan people and advance good governance, economic growth, peace and stability in Afghanistan.

“The participants stressed that sustained international support in the years ahead requires resolute action by both the international community and the Afghan Government, particularly in the coming months, to address areas of TMAF where further progress is required,” the 17-point joint statement noted.

In his remarks, Mr. Kubiš called for further progress, particularly in preparing for next year’s presidential election scheduled for 5 April, and in respect for human rights – including the full implementation of the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) law.

The UN Secretary-General’s Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, Mark Bowden (right), told a news conference that the Senior Officials Meeting has led to “far deeper dialogue” between the donor community and the government.

He encouraged the Afghan Government to take the measures necessary to maintain the independence of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), and cited the importance of a “more vigorous, profound and systematic government-wide approach for fighting corruption,” noting that anti-corruption efforts have a critical impact on levels of donor confidence and private sector investment, in addition to serving the Afghan public.

Based on the lessons of the past decade, the UN Special Representative said that the UN will adjust to new conditions and requirements in the country, “to increase its effectiveness, relevance, improve value for money delivery, work increasingly as ‘One UN.’”

Mr. Kubiš also noted the importance of the upcoming presidential election – as well as provincial and parliamentary elections in 2015 – and emphasized the need to pass two electoral laws that are expected to create a strong legal foundation for future Afghan elections.

The next meeting to follow up on the Tokyo commitments is expected to take place in London soon after next year’s presidential elections.",Q1

Hagood Announces $281 Million Verdict in Wrongful Death Case Against Trucking Company","Trucking companies must write and enforce correct policies and procedures, and supervise and train their employees. The drivers must operate their CMVs with courtesy, competence and respect all other drivers sharing the road. Post this

A unanimous jury in Dimmit County, Texas, returned the $281 million verdict against Heckmann Water Resources (CVR), Inc. on Dec. 4 in the case of Jose Luis Aguilar, et al v. Heckmann Water Resources (CVR), Inc., et al., according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, “South Texas jury awards $281 million in lawsuit” (Dec. 8, 2013). The jury ruled that the trucking company, Heckmann Water Resources, was negligent and caused the fatal accident, according to the San Antonio Express, “Shale company ordered to pay $281M in wrongful death” (Dec. 7, 2013) and official court documents. (Case no. 12-06-11697-DCVCLM, in the District Court of Dimmitt County, Texas, 293rd Judicial District).

“This verdict sends a loud and clear message to trucking companies and drivers,” said Gene S. Hagood, a Houston attorney and one of the three lawyers who represented the plaintiffs. “If someone dies due to a trucking company’s negligent actions, that company will be held responsible. But this verdict is about more than just one family. This verdict will hopefully help make the roads safer throughout Texas and nationally for everyone.”

“It’s not enough to simply make promises to make our roads safer,” Hagood added. “Trucking companies must write and enforce correct policies and procedures, and supervise and train their employees. The drivers must operate their CMVs with courtesy, competence and respect all other drivers sharing the road. Everyone must follow the Department of Transportation regulations. Everyone deserves safe vehicles and drivers on our roads.”

The fatal accident on May 29, 2012 resulted in the death of Carlos Aguilar, a husband, son, father of seven, and a military veteran who returned from two deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq just a few years ago, according to the San Antonio Express article. Mr. Aguilar was killed after a u-joint and driveshaft separated from an 18-wheeler traveling at 67 mph owned by Heckmann Water Resources, an oil patch trucking company, according to San Antonio Express article and court documents for Case no. 12-06-11697-DCVCLM. The 20-pound driveshaft bounced off the road and crashed through the windshield of a truck Mr. Aguilar was a passenger in traveling in the opposite direction, according to the San Antonio Express article.

The jury awarded Mr. Aguilar’s mother, father, wife, seven children and estate $181 million in damages, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram article. Heckmann Water Resources was fined $100 million in punitive damages, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

“The true tragedy behind many truck accidents is that – as we’ve seen in this tragic instance – they’re ultimately preventable,” said Hagood, a wrongful death lawyer in Houston. “Accidents such as Mr. Aguilar’s cannot be tolerated. And hopefully, this verdict will help prevent similar fatal truck accidents in the future.”

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/04/27/pol-veterans-affairs-to-expand-program-for-hiring-injured-veterans.html?cmp=rss,Federal government pledges to hire more injured vets,"Veterans Affairs Canada is set to expand a program designed to give injured veterans priority hiring in the public service after jobs dried up due to federal cuts, CBC News has learned.

Changes to the program geared to Afghanistan veterans will likely include extending the current two-year eligibility period for medically released soldiers, according to information provided to CBC News Network’s Power & Politics.

Niklaus Schwenker, spokesman for Veterans Affairs Minister Steven Blaney, said the department is currently working on that and other ""concrete proposals"" to expand the hiring initiatives and boost the number of veterans working throughout the public service.

""Our government is actively working to create opportunities for Canada’s veterans to get a good, well-paid job which we know is an essential part of a successful transition from military to civilian life,"" he said.

The Public Service Commission, which oversees the program, said cuts to the civil service has meant fewer jobs available for vets.

""Over the past year, most priority appointments have been of public servants whose jobs have been affected, as they have an entitlement to be appointed ahead of all others under the law,"" said Annie Trepanier, spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission.

""There has been a corresponding decline in the number of appointments of Canadian veterans who have been medically released. The PSC and Veterans Affairs, which has overall responsibility for policy and programs for Canada's veterans, have been monitoring the situation closely. At their request, the PSC has identified options and provided these to Veterans Affairs for consideration.""

Hiring numbers low

Only 30 veterans have been hired through the priority hiring program between April 2012 and March 2013, Trepanier said. Thousands of soldiers returned home from Afghanistan physically or psychologically injured — some of them so severely that they had to leave the military.

The program – launched back in 2005 – was designed to aid the transition by giving veterans priority hiring in the public service.

Between the program launch and Sept. 2012, 8,702 Canadian Forces members have been medically released, and about 1,027 have been hired for positions in the public service.

'We shouldn’t be putting them at risk because of a hiring freeze or reducing the size of the public service.' — Liberal Senator Romeo Dallaire

The bulk of them, 741, were at the Department of National Defence while most other departments had hired only a small handful, if any at all, according to the figures obtained by Liberal Senator Percy Downe.

Downe and retired general Romeo Dallaire called it ""absolutely critical"" to extend the eligibility period because many Afghanistan veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and need time to stabilize.

""Keeping it limited to two years after they’ve been deemed to be able to be employed without giving them the flexibility of ensuring the depth of the injury is corrected was wrong,"" he told Power & Politics guest host Rosemary Barton.

""We need more time, and the limitation of the two years is artificial… that two-year restriction is something that comes out of an insurance policy, not out of a policy of wanting to ensure that we’re helping veterans for the length of the possible time that they can be employed.""

Dallaire said numbers are low because many departments are not following the policy, there is not enough training to make the ex-soldiers competitive. He also said there should be a provision so that veterans are ""moved aside"" by other employees affected by cuts.

""We shouldn’t be putting them at risk because of a hiring freeze or reducing the size of the public service,"" he said.

Helmets to Hardhats — another program launched in September 2012 and designed to help former soldiers find work in trades —has registered 977 veterans and 77 employers and contractors but so far, only 18 jobs have been confirmed filled through the program.",Q1
http://www.zawya.com/story/Taliban_leader_Baradar_released-GN_21092013_220950/,Taliban leader Baradar released,"Saturday, Sep 21, 2013

Islamabad Pakistan yesterday (Saturday) released the senior most Afghan Taliban leader in its custody, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar to further facilitate the reconciliation process in Afghanistan.

The foreign ministry, which announced the decision Friday, confirmed the release of the former second-in-command in the Afghan Taliban movement after more than two years in captivity.. He had been captured in Karachi in 2010 in a joint operation by CIA and ISI.

A ministry official said the move was significant for the reconciliation process in Afghanistan, which has not so far gained perceptible momentum.

“Yes Baradar has been released,” Omar Hamid, a spokesman for Pakistan’s interior ministry said, without elaborating on the circumstances of the release.

The release was welcomed by Afghanistan’s High Peace Council (HPC), the body nominated by President Hamid Karzai to try to talk to the militants, who have waged a bloody insurgency since being ousted from power by a US-led invasion in 2001.

“We thank the government of Pakistan that showed goodwill and answered positively to the request of Afghanistan government,” Mohammad Esmail Qasimyar, senior member of HPC, said.

“Baradar is someone who has always been eager to join peace negotiations, and we hope he joins peace talks soon. We are optimistic about it, he is still an influential figure and the Taliban still respect him.”

It was not disclosed whether Baradar will stay for the time being in Pakistan, return to Afghanistan or go to some other country.

During his visit to Islamabad last month, Afghan President Hamid Karzai had renewed demand for his release as he sought Islamabad’s support to boost the peace process.

Baradar is one of the four men who founded the Taliban movement in Afghanistan in 1994. He had served in senior positions in the Taliban government until its fall in 2001 as a result of the US-led invasion.

Pakistan had earlier freed more than 30 Afghan Taliban detainees since it started the process in November last year in response to a request by the Afghan High Peace Council. Whether they had been in any way helpful to the reconciliation efforts is not known..

The Afghan Taliban opened a political office in Doha in June, but it was closed after President Karzai complained that they had flown a flag and put up a plaque as if they were a government in exile. Since then the US, UK, and Turkey have all reportedly tried to mediate to reopen talks.

Rustam Sah, a former Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan, said Baradar’s release had come under an ‘understanding” with Kabul.

He was skeptical about Baradar’s release leading to any breakthrough in the stalemated Afghan peace process.

“Credibility of a person who has been under detention becomes questionable and I don’t think Mullah Baradar can make a difference even if were able to reintegrate into the Taliban movement,” the former ambassador commented.

Shah also pointed out that there was no indication as yet that Taliban were ready to change their oft-repeated stand that they would not negotiate with the Afghan government as they say it is merely a “puppet” of foreign occupiers of the country.

Washington gave a muted response to news that Baradar was about to be released, with a State Department spokeswoman on Friday refusing to say whether the US had asked Pakistan to keep tabs on Baradar.

In the first death since last October, the Special Forces soldier was shot and killed about 3pm (AEST) on Saturday in a firefight with Afghan insurgents in Khod Valley in southern Afghanistan.

Immediate first aid was provided to the three soldiers wounded in the firefight.

Special Forces was working with the Afghan Provincial Response Company on an

operation to disrupt an insurgent network known to have direct influences on insurgent activity in Uruzgan province.

Another Special Forces soldier also was shot and seriously wounded while a Royal Australian Air Force airman received minor injuries. Both were being treated at bases in Afghanistan.

Australian Defence Force chief General David Hurley said the deceased soldier, based in Sydney's 2nd Commando Regiment, was described by his colleagues as ""one of the most iconic figures"" in the regiment.

It was his fifth tour of Afghanistan. He had also served in Iraq and East Timor.

General Hurley said frantic efforts by his colleagues to administer first aid were unsuccessful.

""This man was a decorated soldier,"" General Hurley said.

""In combat and as a team commander, he was the man to watch and was never happier than when the situation demanded decisive action and courage.""

His name has not been released yet as his family have requested privacy.

Ms Gillard said ""every death, every loss"" in Afghanistan hit the nation hard but noted the longer time period since the last death.

Corporal Scott Smith, of the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, was killed after an improvised explosive device on October 21, last year.

""I think many had probably lulled themselves into a false sense of security that we would see no more losses in Afghanistan,"" the PM said.

""This news reminds us that the mission in ongoing, that the danger is ongoing.""

Defence said an inquiry officer would examine the circumstances surrounding the death. More than 250 Australians have been wounded in Afghanistan.

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott also extended his condolences to the affected family.

""Their work in Afghanistan is about making the world a safer place, so that it never again becomes a base for international terror,"" he said.

""The death of this soldier is a reminder of the service and sacrifice of the ADF.""

General Hurley said it was an indication the war in Afghanistan was not over yet.

""This particular missions still has 18 months to go to the end of next year,'' he said.

""We share their loss and we feel their pain, and we will support them through the difficult days ahead.

""My thoughts and prayers are also with our wounded personnel and their families. I wish them a speedy recovery.""

http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Syrian-rebels-receive-heavy-weapons-from-Sudan-28760.html,Syrian rebels receive heavy weapons from Sudan,"The weapons are made in China and include anti-aircraft missile batteries. Khartoum denies any involvement in the Syrian conflict. Divisions between rebel factions and Iranian interests render all diplomatic effort towards a cease-fire null and void.

Damascus (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Small arms, anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft defense systems are just some of the weapons being sent to Syrian rebels by the Sudanese government. According to a recently published analysis, most of the weapons are made in China. To circumvent the embargo the Khartoum government sends the container to Qatar, who channels it to the militias with the complicity of the Turkish government.



The main funders of the material are: Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. When asked about the case, the Sudanese officials repeatedly denied any involvement in the Syrian civil war. Sid Imad Ahmad Hassam spokesman for President Omar al-Bashir, said that ""Sudan has never sent weapons to Syria."" Sawarmi Khalid Al-Saad, a spokesman for the Sudanese Armed Forces, added: ""We have no interest in supporting groups in Syria, especially if the outcome of the fighting is not clear. These allegations are meant to harm our relations with countries Sudan has good relations with"".



The continued sale of arms to the Syrian rebels and the Assad army - which is pitting leading Arab states, Turkey and now the United States for the rebels and Russia and Iran for Assad - makes any return to diplomatic approach to stop the civil war increasingly uncertain, a war which so far has cost the lives of over 100 thousand people in two years.



Despite its open military support to the Assad government, Moscow is pushing for a peace conference in Syria. In recent days, Gennady Gatilov, deputy Russian foreign minister, said that talks between the various parties are expected by the end of August, in preparation for the Geneva 2 conference, which aims to bring the leaders of the rebellion and members of the Assad government to the same table. According to the diplomat, the meeting will be held most likely in October.



The Arab League and the United States remain skeptical. Iran, the Assad family's greatest supporter should also participate at the conference. Added to the Iranian problem, are increasing divisions within the over 60 rebel factions, comprised at least 50% by foreign Islamist militants. They are fighting against the rebels secular wing, with an aim to building an Islamic state in Syria and not a republic. For this reason they have no interest in putting an end to the bloodshed.",Q1
http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/10591347.Wounded_Rawdon_soldier_battles_all_obstacles_in_his_way/,Wounded Rawdon soldier battles all obstacles in his way,"Lance Bombardier James Simpson, 27, of Rawdon, is set to be the first double amputee to take part in a Spartan Race event.

Spartan Race is an open country run punctuated with a range of punishing, surprise obstacles – from mud crawls and ice-pit plunges to cargo-net climbs and fire-log leaps.

L/Bdr Simpson was serving with 5th Regiment Royal Artillery when he stepped on an improvised explosive device as he returned from a foot patrol in Helmand. He lost his legs above the knee and also damaged his arms in the blast in November 2009.

Now he is training for Spartan Race in woods close to his home where he is trying to match his different prosthetics with the terrain and obstacles the event will throw at him.

He has been using his running blades – shortened versions of those used by Paralympics track athletes – and what he calls his stubbies, which are small pads that fit on the bottom of what is left of his thighs.

L/Bdr Simpson said he plans to carry both at the event next month and swap them when necessary using an Allen key.

“It’s going to be a challenge,” he said. “It’s not so much the run I’m really worried about, it’s getting over the obstacles.

“I’m going to be a lot shorter because of my blades. I’m going to have to rely on my arms and my legs.

“I want every step to be my own. I don’t want to rely on my team to get me over obstacles.”

L/Bdr Simpson is starting with the Spartan York Sprint on September 8 near Ripon which features more than 25 obstacles over a 5km course.

Race director of Spartan Race UK former Royal Marines Commando Richard Lee said: “James’s inspirational example is very moving.

“By enrolling in his first Spartan Race, he is showing great courage and setting a new British record by becoming our first double amputee to run a UK Spartan Race.

“He is a perfect example of what we stand for at Spartan Race.”

L/Bdr Simpson, who is leaving the Army in September to become a student, is hoping his participation will raise money for the national armed forces charity SSAFA.

http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/811559.shtml,Pakistan announces army withdrawal from Malala’s town,"Pakistan announces army withdrawal from Malala’s town

Pakistan is to start withdrawing troops from a troubled northwestern district where Taliban insurgents shot schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai in the head, local officials said Sunday.



The army in 2009 sent 30,000 troops to battle Taliban fighters controlled by cleric Maulana Fazlullah, who since 2007 had taken control of the scenic Swat valley and waged a campaign of beheadings, other violence and attacks on girls' schools.



By July 2009 the army declared the region back under control and said the rebels had all been killed, captured or fled. But more than 20,000 troops remained in Swat and adjacent districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.



Some security officials in Swat have voiced fears that Fazlullah and his loyalists, who escaped into eastern Afghanistan, could make a comeback in the event of a complete army pullout.



The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pervez Khattak, late Saturday approved the phased withdrawal, his spokesman Shiraz Paracha said.



In the initial stage, troops will be withdrawn from neighboring Buner and Shangla districts in October.



""Chief minister Pervez Khattak has approved gradual withdrawal of forces from Swat and Malakand division. Forces will start leaving Shangla and Buner districts in the first phase from next month,"" the spokesman told AFP.



A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the withdrawal next month of 300 soldiers from Buner and Shangla, but denied there would be a complete troop withdrawal from the Swat valley in coming months.



But the provincial government spokesman said Khattak ""has signed relevant documents"" and a ""detailed plan of complete withdrawal will be finalized with law-enforcing agencies.""



The Swat operation was one of Pakistan's most successful offensives against the homegrown insurgents.

Speaking with Prime Minister David Cameron, who today paid a surprise visit to Afghanistan to mark Armed Forces Day, Karzai said dialogue was the only way to end 12 years of war.

He said: “The attack organised near the presidential palace will not deter us from seeking peace. We’ve had them killing the Afghan people but we still ask for peace.”

Afghanistan's first vice president, Marshal Mohammed Fahim, a polarising leader whose political and military career spanned the Soviet War and the American invasion, died Sunday. He was 57. He died of an undisclosed illness, according to Afghanistan's presidential palace.

Born in 1957, Fahim first gained notoriety as a young commander during the Soviet occupation of the 1980s and then as an anti-Taliban leader in the 1990s — a legacy he would parlay into a formal position of power under President Hamid Karzai. In 2001, with American support, he helped topple the Taliban as leader of the Northern Alliance.

Karzai on Sunday called Fahim's death ""a huge loss for Afghanistan.""

While Fahim's battlefield experience inspired respect in many, to others he symbolised a new generation of Afghan warlords who profited immensely from his proximity to power and foreign aid. By many accounts, Fahim grew enormously wealthy in the years after 2002, first during his stint as defense minister and then as vice president.

As he ascended the country's political ranks, Afghans and foreign diplomats alike grumbled that they were empowering a man with a shadowy record. But many recognised that plucking Fahim from power would do more harm than good, potentially upsetting a delicate ethnic balance.

In 2002, when aid began flowing to help create a new Afghan army, Fahim was thought to be one of the main beneficiaries. He was long plagued by allegations of drug trafficking and corruption, which many say helped enrich a growing circle of devotees, mostly from his own Tajik ethnicity.

He built large homes and held private games of Buzkashi, where men on horseback fight for control of a goat carcass. He maintained an enormous security detail, which grew after a major Taliban attack targeted his convoy in 2009.

Despite the allegations against Fahim, he no doubt played a crucial role in a multi-ethnic government that, to some degree, helped unite Tajiks and Pashtuns, the country's two major ethnicities. After he ran for office as Karzai's vice president in 2009, photos of his likeness were plastered all over Kabul, where they remain today.

Karzai awarded Fahim the honorary title of ""Afghanistan's Marshal"" for his role during the various wars. And while many foreign diplomats raised concerns about him privately, Fahim was seen by many as a man who had accrued too much power to be dismissed or marginalised.

On Sunday, a United Nations statement called him ""a good and trusted partner of the UN.""

It's unclear precisely what role Fahim would have played in the country's upcoming presidential elections or the subsequent political transition, but no one doubts that he would have used his political muscle to harness Tajik voters 5 April to secure his position in the next administration. Many believe he would have supported Abdullah Abdullah, also a former Northern Alliance commander. Because of his sizable following and ethnic clout, Fahim could have been a force for unity or instability, depending on how he instructed his men to behave. In that respect, he has no clear successor.

The Afghan government called for three days of national mourning, during which the national flag will be lowered to half-mast.

http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/16/war-crimes-courts-tribunals,War crimes courts and tribunals proliferate,"The proliferation of UN-backed special courts and tribunals, mainly clustered around The Hague, has been built on a 19th-century ambition to regulate the rules of war and settle international disputes. The first Hague convention of 1899 tried to formulate laws prohibiting war crimes. The international criminal court, founded in 2002, is the latest embodiment of the determination to outlaw genocide and crimes against humanity. Before the ICC was established, specialised courts to deal with the aftermath of particular conflicts were set up. The pioneers were the postwar Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials.

In the 1990s, the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), was created in The Hague to deal with crimes in the Balkans. The ICTY, as well as prosecuting the former Serb commander Ratko Mladic, tried the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. He died in 2006 before the verdict could be delivered.

The international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, based in Arusha, Tanzania, dealt with the 1994 genocide. The Hague is also home to the special tribunal for Lebanon, which is investigating the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri in Beirut in 2005. The special court for Sierra Leone was established in 2002 to bring to justice those responsible for atrocities perpetrated during the country's country's civil war in 1996.

The ICC is expected to supersede regional temporary, region-focused war crimes tribunals and assume the role of a permanent court to ""end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community"".

The USA, a generous backer of the regional tribunals, is not a signatory to the ICC. Critics accuse Washington of wanting to ensure US citizens have effective international immunity from prosecution. The case of Khaled el-Masri, a German national who accuses the CIA of sending him to a secret prison in Afghanistan, was heard at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The court, used by the 47 member states of the Council of Europe including the UK, deals with appeals beyond national jurisdictions on issues in relation to the European convention on human rights.",Q1

http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/54684/,"‘Article 226 makes it clear that all elections, except for PM and Ms, would be held by secret ballot’","ISLAMABAD (APP): The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday adjourned hearing in a presidential reference seeking opinion on open balloting for the upcoming Senate elections till Thursday.

A five-member larger bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mushir Alam, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi heard the reference.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, while continuing his arguments, said the Constitution did not mention the procedure for the election of NA speaker and deputy speaker and Senate chairman and deputy chairman.

The house officials conducted the elections where the Constitution did not specify the procedure, he said. The outgoing speaker served as returning officer for the election of the next one, he added.

He said the elections whose procedure was stipulated in the Constitution, would be considered under the Constitution.

The Constitution called for the creation of national and provincial assemblies, he added.

Justice Ijaz observed that the court understood the crux of his argument that the Constitution called to form offices and bodies, but the method of their election was in the law not in the Constitution.

The AGP said the offices of national and provincial assemblies were not constituted under the Constitution but under the law. The Constitution provided their composition, but laws and acts had been made for their elections, he added.

He said the duration of the parliament, the modus operandi, the number of sittings, etcetera were stated but the Constitution did not specify the procedure for the elections.

He said only the number of elected representatives was mentioned in the Constitution, but laws and acts were made for their election by the constituents.

The AGP said the number of special seats for women and minority and full composition of the parliament were provided in the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz asked how the elections were held for the women reserved seats.

The AGP replied that women seats were allocated by the winning ratio of the political parties. It was written in the Constitution that the National Assembly (NA) elections were held under the law, he added.

Addressing the AGP, the CJP said according to him (AGP) the NA elections were held by law.

Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan said the Act 2017 called for elections by secret ballot.

The AGP said Article 59 provided the composition of the Senate. The word act was also used for women in the Senate, he added.

He said direct votes and constituencies had been mentioned for the NA but direct elections were not mentioned for the Senate.

Justice Bandial said the formal procedure for the election of NA members was given in the law but not for the Senate.

The AGP said the procedure for Senate elections was different as members of provincial assemblies proposed the candidates for the Senate. Independent candidates could also participate in the Senate elections, he added.

Justice Ijaz said the members of the provincial assemblies should be allowed to exercise their votes freely.

The attorney general said elections of Senate chairman, deputy chairman, prime minister and the chief ministers were not clear in the Election Commission and the Election Act. Article 60 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the Senate chairman, he added.

Justice Ijaz said Articles 53 and 60 of the Constitution did not mention that there would be open ballot elections or secret elections.

The attorney general said the elections of the NA speaker and Senate chairman would be held through secret balloting under the Article 266.

He said it was clear in the Constitution that the outgoing NA speaker would conduct the election of the speaker. The first task of the elected assembly would be the election of the speaker, he added.

He said the elections of the prime minister, NA speaker and Senate chairman were not conducted under the Election Act.

He said the parliament itself conducted the elections of the prime minister, Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.

He said Article 53 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the speaker but Senate and NA elections were not held under the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz said Article 226 made it clear that all elections, except for the prime minister and the chief ministers, would be held by the secret ballot.

The AGP said the chapter on elections held under the law was different.

The Article 226 did not apply to every election, he added.

The chief justice said if Article 226 applied, the elections for reserved seats could not take place.

He said elections for the national and provincial assemblies were held under the law.

The attorney general said all laws were framed in accordance with the Constitution.

He said political parties submit lists for representation on reserved seats.

He said an independent candidate could contest the Senate election if he was nominated and proposed by a member of the provincial assembly.

Justice Ijaz said if any member of the provincial assembly wanted to vote against the party, he should use open balloting.

The attorney general said generally people considered election only on voting day but the election machinery was also part of the voting process. Elections were not just about voting as it had many stages, he added.

He said constituency elections, preparation of voter lists, delimitation, nomination papers, voting schedule, voting and results were all the stages.

The chief justice said those were the stages of direct elections.

The attorney general said whether there was an assembly or not, the president could issue an ordinance related to the elections.

He said the Senate Election Act of 1975 also laid down the procedure for holding Senate elections.

He said elections under the law could not be challenged but only elections held under the statute could be challenged in tribunals.

Justice Ijaz said elections under the law could be challenged under the Constitution.

The attorney general said the vote of an ordinary citizen was free but the vote of a member of provincial assembly (MPA) given to a senator was not free.

When the MPA’s vote for the Senate could not be free, then the ballot could not be secret, he added.

Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan said it was unwise to vote for another senator by secret ballot in violation of party discipline.

The MPA violating party discipline should have moral courage to openly say that he had voted against the party discipline, he added.

Upon this, Justice Bandial said this was moral, not legal. The MPA had the right to vote according to his will, he added.

The chief justice said the courts were the guardians of the Constitution.

Justice Yahya Afridi addressing the AGP said his argument was moral in nature and the matter was political.

He said the question raised in the presidential reference was legal and ethical but the matter was political.

He asked the attorney general that his case was based on ethics while the issue was political.

He asked why the government was seeking the opinion of the court instead of approaching the parliament?

The attorney general said the government had only approached the SC for an opinion.

If the opinion of the SC was in government’s favour, the final decision was to be taken by the parliament, he added.

He said the SC had given its opinion on the NA’s resolution regarding recognizing Bangladesh.

Justice Afridi said the AGP’s argument regarding Bangladesh was correct.

The attorney general said he could give eleven examples of cases in which the court ruled despite the presence of political aspects.

He said the apex court disqualified politicians by interpreting the law in dual citizenship cases.

He said the issue of disclosure of assets of parliamentarians was political but the SC also interpreted the law on it.

The government had come to the SC to stop the sale and purchase of votes and for transparency, he added.

Justice Ijaz asked the AGP whether he was just asking the court to interpret the Article 226 only?

The attorney general responded that he could not put it more simply.",Q1

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/08/hamid-karzai-outburst-nato-afghanistan,Hamid Karzai's latest outburst at Nato forces is sign of his deep frustration | Simon Tisdall,"Coming from a man who owes his job and probably his life to US and British military support, President Hamid Karzai's stinging criticisms of Nato's performance in Afghanistan may seem a little hypocritical. But with western politicians and generals busily conspiring to declare the 12-year war a success ahead of next year's withdrawal, Karzai's comments are a salutary reminder that all is far from well in Afghanistan – and that things could turn very messy, very soon.

Karzai's main point – that Nato operations have caused ""great suffering and loss of life"" among the Afghan civilian population and have failed to secure the country – is difficult to dispute. It is one of those uncomfortable home truths that western leaders intent on justifying the human and material cost of the 2001 intervention, and on getting out on schedule, just do not want to hear. Time and time again, Karzai has angrily denounced military strikes that accidentally killed civilians, and complained that US forces override or ignore Afghan sovereignty.

After the most recent incident on Friday, Karzai weighed in again in person. ""President Karzai strongly condemned the Nato air strike in which he says five civilians, including three students aged 10, 14 and 16, were killed in eastern Nangarhar province on Friday night,"" a statement from Karzai's palace said.

Civilian casualties are reportedly on the rise again after falling back. Figures collated by the Guardian suggest a total of 14,728 civilians have died in the past six years, though vastly more were killed by the Taliban than by Nato.

Rising losses among the nearly 350,000-strong Afghan army and police, and a desertion rate of about 50,000 a year, also support Karzai's contention that control of large parts of the country remains tenuous. Nato generals are adamant they are on course for a smooth handover of security responsibilities by December 2014. The top British commander in Afghanistan, Lt Gen John Lorimer, said in June the Afghan military was proving an ""effective force"" that was ""going on the front foot"" against the insurgents.

But last year about 10 times as many Afghan army and police were killed compared with Nato troops, and the figures this year are believed to be even higher. Some Afghan politicians and independent analysts believe another civil war is inevitable once Nato leaves and that, whatever western leaders say, the Kabul government will be powerless to prevent it.

Karzai's outburst is the product of other frustrations, including his belief that the US engaged in ""duplicitous"" behaviour in attempting to engage Taliban elements in peace talks, ostensibly behind his back. Karzai says he wants an accommodation with the Taliban before he is obliged to stand down after next April's presidential poll – but understandably wants to do so on his terms, not Washington's.

Karzai and the Obama administration are also at odds over post-2014 security arrangements, with no agreement yet on a renewed bilateral security agreement (BSA) or a continued non-combat Nato presence. One problem is that US policymakers and commentators differ over Afghanistan's strategic importance. Some believe a stable, pro-western Pakistan is a more vital American interest – another irritant for Karzai, who has often clashed with Islamabad and claims that Afghan insurgents operate with impunity from Pakistani bases.

Bad feeling in Washington about Karzai stems partly from the steep cost of supporting the Afghan economy and the endemic official corruption and drug-peddling that has damaged his government's reputation. His frankness has frequently prompted a sharp US response. In 2009, Barack Obama reportedly called Karzai an ineffective and unreliable partner. And Washington Post journalist and author Bob Woodward, a White House insider, told CBS in 2010 that Karzai suffered mental health problems.

""Karzai is a diagnosed manic depressive, somebody who has mood swings. Sometimes it's controlled, sometimes it's not. If you just look at what he has said in public and on the record, you know, one moment he's totally embracing us, the next moment he's denouncing the United States,"" Woodward said.

""Karzai seems determined to exit having left the equivalent of a poison pill to his successor,"" said Anthony Cordesman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. ""He has never been willing to come to grips with the military realities shaping the war … Almost every week he creates a new and unnecessary problem in US and Afghan relations, evidently on the assumption that the US … has serious rather than marginal strategic interest in Afghanistan.""

Whatever the Americans say, Karzai's latest broadside looks like the beginning of an increasingly problematic, dangerous countdown to April's presidential election, which features no obvious successor and far too many unsettling echoes of the pre-2001 past. Among the candidates and their running mates are former warlords including Ismail Khan, General Abdul Rashid Dostum, and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the man who invited Osama bin Laden to set up shop in Afghanistan in 1996.

Western countries will probably be rooting for the former foreign minister, Abdullah Abdullah, who was runner-up in the 2009 election. Their support could prove fatal to his cause. No one knows what the poll's outcome will be or what will ensue. But by this time next year, Obama and others may have cause to miss their old sparring partner Karzai.",Q1

None of the Afghan Taliban prisoners freed by the Pakistani government have reached their homes yet, said a Taliban source on Wednesday.





Moreover, neither have the freed militants been handed over to the Afghanistan Embassy in Islamabad nor to the country’s diplomatic missions in Pakistani provincial capitals.Pakistan released a group of seven Afghan Taliban prisoners on Saturday to “further facilitate the Afghan reconciliation process,” as described by a foreign ministry statement.Pakistani officials had informed families of some of the freed Taliban members earlier this year and in November last year about their release. But the families of the latest set of freed prisoners have been not informed, he told The Express Tribune. “None of the freed inmates have rejoined their families or contacted them.”During the last ten months, 33 detained Taliban members have been released in Pakistan.The Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman, Janan Mosazai, said in Kabul on Sunday that none of the freed Taliban men had been handed over either to the Afghanistan Embassy in Islamabad or any Consulate.Pakistan had started the process to release the Afghan Taliban prisoners on the request made by the Afghanistan government and its High Peace Council in November last year.The latest list of the Taliban prisoners included the name of key commander Mansoor Dadullah, the brother of Mullah Dadullah Akhund, the Taliban senior commander who was killed by American and British troops in southern Afghanistan in May 2007.In February 2008, Mansoor Dadullah was arrested by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan along with some of his colleagues. He had differences with leadership following the murder of his brother.However, a source told The Express Tribune that he had reconciled with the Taliban during detention.1. Mansoor Dadullah, a key Taliban commander, was arrested in February 2008 in Balochistan. He is the brother of Mullah Dadullah, a senior commander killed in southern Afghanistan in May 20072. Sayed Wali had served as the Taliban chief of Khogiani and Achin districts of eastern Nangarhar province following the dissolution of Taliban government. He was arrested in Peshawar two years ago.3. Abdul Manan, alias Mullah Salam, served as the shadow governor of the northern Kunduz province after the Taliban fell at the centre. He was arrested in Peshawar three years ago. He hails from Kandahar, the Taliban birthplace.4. Gul Mohammad, arrested more than six years ago in Pakistan, had served as the shadow governor of Kunar.5. Mohammad Zai served as Kandahar’s shadow governor. He was arrested in Quetta.6.

(ret.) John Allen, head of a 160-strong US defense and intelligence team that has drawn up a plan for the day after an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Allen briefed Netanyahu on the plan last week when he was here with Kerry, and this will be his first meeting with Abbas.The Palestinians have come out against the plan , which is believed to include an Israeli security presence in the Jordan Valley for an extended period.

Abbas told Sky News Arabia Television on Thursday that he would not accept a single Israeli soldier on Palestinian territory.“If America wants to protect the security of Israel, they can go there [to the Jordan Valley], but we will not accept Israel being there,” he said.A PA official in Ramallah said that Abbas would reiterate during his meeting with Kerry his opposition to the recent US security ideas. The official claimed that Kerry has been exerting enormous pressure on Abbas to accept the US security proposals.“Kerry has endorsed the Israeli position on security and borders,” the official charged.Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said in an Israel Radio interview, however, that Israel must retain its security in its own hands. He said that although he understood this would be “hard for the Palestinians to swallow,” they would have to accept that “Israel has security interests it cannot forgo, and if they want peace, they must make significant compromises.”Unlike previous trips here, when the pattern has been that Kerry first meets with Netanyahu, then goes to Abbas, and returns for a follow-up meeting with the prime minister, this time the meeting with Netanyahu will take place on Friday after Kerry meets with Abbas.Kerry is also scheduled to meet with President Shimon Peres Friday, before leaving for Vietnam and the Philippines.One of the ideas that Kerry brought with him was of a marathon negotiating summit to draw up a framework that would enable a continuation of the talks that have been taking place since late July, Channel 2 reported. The thinking, according to the report, is that to create a breakthrough in the talks, there is a need to bring matters to the leadership level for decisions. US President Barack Obama said last week at the Saban Forum in Washington that it was possible “over the next several months to arrive at a framework that does not address every single detail, but gets us to a point where everybody recognizes [it is] better to move forward than move backward.”Abbas, however, said in the Sky News Arabia Television that a framework accord could delay a full resolution of the conflict.“We will not accept an interim deal. We will accept a final agreement that can be implemented in stages,” he said.Obama said on Saturday that the Palestinians would have to “recognize that there is going to be a transition period where the Israeli people cannot expect a replica of Gaza in the West Bank.”This transition period would require “some restraint on the part of the Palestinians,” he said.“They don’t get everything that they want on day one.”Abbas said that the PA’s main goal was to reach a deal with security and clear borders, where Jerusalem would be the capital of the future Palestinian state. “We can’t accept any agreement that does not include Jerusalem as our capital,” he said.

Two people have been killed after a convoy of foreign military vehicles was targeted in an explosion at a prison in eastern Kabul, sources have told Al Jazeera.

A police chief told Al Jazeera that the bomber targeted two vehicles on Monday near the Pul-i-Charkhi prison on the Kabul-Jalalabad highway.

NATO’s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), did not give the nationality of the victims – who were NATO civilian contractors.

Hezb-e Islami, which is allied with the Taliban, later claimed responsibility for the attack.

In an interview with Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper last month, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the group, vowed to kill as many Western soldiers as possible before the NATO pullout.

A local shopkeeper named Jameel, told the Associated Press news agency that he saw two NATO vehicles leaving the prison when a car slammed into the second one. There was no immediate word on casualties.

Police and ambulances went to the scene near the prison where two civilian vehicles lay overturned and nearby shop windows were shattered from the force of the explosion.

""The intelligence services inform us to be prepared as the Taliban want to attack us. Of course it is dangerous, but we will do our best.""Parast said the IEC was pushing ahead with voter registration in some of the country's most volatile districts, where US forces are still fighting the Taliban.""We are sending mobile teams out to Spin Boldak, Maiwand, Panjwayi and Arghandab. We want to get to where people live away from the district centres,"" he said.""We are trying to have a good election and are preparing according to the (April) schedule. There were problems in 2009, but we have plans on how to control them.""The challenges are formidable, and other IEC staff say they are struggling against impossible odds.""We are not provided with security forces when we go out to dangerous areas,"" said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity.""We need more support, but instead we are left without enough vehicles or fuel.""The IEC doesn't just face the Taliban, we face the local government and we face the candidates, who are often warlords.""Kandahar was notorious for the ravages of competing warlords when in the chaotic early 1990s the Taliban first gained popular support as a force for law and order.Chief among the city's feared strongmen was Gul Agha Sherzai, who is now a prominent candidate to become president.""If there was development in talks with the Taliban, then it would help make an election more peaceful,"" said Haji Agha Lalai, a member of the Kandahar provincial council.""We think it should be postponed as security is not good. The Taliban plan to attack, but the politicians in Kabul tells us it will go ahead anyway.""The UN and Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) report into the 2009 vote details how Kandahar was awash with corruption and violence.Intimidation tactics included roadside bombs that killed IEC staff, abductions, illegal checkpoints and threatening ""night letters"".Government officials and police ordered people how to vote and stuffed ballot boxes with bundles of votes.A repeat of such scenes next year would wreck claims that a functioning state has been established in Afghanistan and that the withdrawal of foreign troops does not risk a return to the turmoil of the warlords.""The election process is so weak that the IEC asked us to help with awareness,"" said Abdullah Wali Wadan, head of the Karwan (""Caravan"") youth movement in Kandahar.""We will try, but people see that the international community brought elections and then bad people got hold of power, so there is deep mistrust.""We tell people the election is the best way, but many here don't believe us.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/afghan-president-brother-karzai-withdraws-election,Afghan president's brother withdraws from election race,"The Afghan presidential campaign narrowed from a chaotic field of challengers to a three-way race on Thursday when the brother of the incumbent, Hamid Karzai, ended his own bid for power and threw his political weight behind the candidate believed to be the current president's favourite.

Qayum Karzai's decision to back the low-profile former foreign minister Zalmai Rassoul creates a powerful ticket that appears to carry the covert blessing of the country's leader, and consolidates the strongest block of support from the last poll – ethnic Pashtuns from the south – behind one candidate.

Both men will stay on the ballot papers, as it is too late to make changes, but Qayum Karzai will be telling his supporters to cast their vote for Rassoul to continue a decade of progress, he said at a brief press conference convened to announce the long-rumoured union.

Rassoul paid tribute to his new ally as a ""great politician"" who had made a brave move.

""Joining our team will benefit the nation of Afghanistan … we are sure that we will win the election,"" he told a gathering of journalists, campaign workers and influential elders.

They have two main rivals, who at the moment are both on track to win more than a quarter of the votes, recent polls show.

One is the academic and financial reformer Ashraf Ghani, who has allied with a civil-war era warlord to boost his chances after a dismal showing in 2009.

The other is Abdullah Abdullah, Karzai's main challenger in the last election, who has spent the intervening years building a grassroots support network in his northern base and beyond.

Even with a combined ticket Rassoul and Karzai lag far behind, but more aggressive campaigning in the south could rapidly change election dynamics and there is room for more high-profile support.

Several others from the 11-strong field of would-be presidents are in talks to join Rassoul's camp, campaign sources say, including a former defence minister and a grandson of the country's last king.

Most are Pashtuns from Karzai's Durrani tribe, which has ruled Afghanistan with just a few interruptions for over 200 years.

President Karzai had made little effort to hide his opposition to the idea of his brother taking his place in the presidential palace, and when a gathering of tribal elders reportedly backed Qayum over his 75-year-old rival, he ordered them and the two candidates to reconsider.

Some of the group were worried that Rassoul would struggle to win votes in what should be his heartland. Although ethnically Pashtun, he has spent most of his life in Kabul or abroad, does not speak fluent Pashto, and in a breach of traditional norms that riles some conservatives, has never married or had children.

Although most of the prominent candidates are running on multi-ethnic tickets, with a modern, nationalistic platform, there is no doubt that strong tribal loyalties will play a key role bringing in voters on for the 5 April election.

Karzai's backing will bring name-recognition and votes in the family's home near Kandahar. But even if it means stiffer competition, his rival Abdullah said he welcomed the change because it meant a more ""clear-cut"" campaign.

""No candidate will be capable of making the collection of political leaders that President Karzai made last time around when he was the candidate, and almost all the known political leaders were in one camp … and I wasn't worried then,"" he said. ""Things have changed. The younger generation are more educated and decide on a different basis.""",Q1

Baryalia Safi, 40, from Glenbeg Court in Coleraine, County Londonderry, is charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old in a flat in Asylum Road in Derry on Saturday.

33-year-old Hossein Hamati, also from Glenbeg Court, is accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old.

They were released on bail and the case was adjourned until 31 July.

A police officer told the district judge that the defendants picked up the girls outside a city centre bar just before 03:00 BST on Saturday.

He said they told the girls they were going to a party, and invited them to join them.

The officer said the girls were then driven to the flat, where the defendants gave them vodka.

One of the girls was allegedly sexually assaulted in the bedroom, and the other in the living room.

Afterwards they left the flat and went to Strand Road police station, where they made the allegations against the defendants.

The men were arrested in the pizza parlour where they work in Ballymoney, County Antrim, and spent the rest of the weekend in custody.

The police officer said she objected to bail being granted because she believed that if released, they could flee the jurisdiction.

Mr Safi was born in Afghanistan, and Mr Hamati in Iran.

Their solicitor said Mr Safi had two children and an ex-wife in Northern Ireland, and Mr Hamati has applied for citizenship.

The district judge said he accepted both defendants have a long association with Northern Ireland.

The defendants were released on their own bail of £500, plus two sureties of £2,500.

They were ordered to be electronically tagged, banned from drinking alcohol, and ordered to observe a curfew.

They were also banned from unsupervised contact with children under 16 - apart from Mr Safi's visits to his own children - and from contacting their alleged victims.

The defendants were also ordered not to enter Derry.",Q1

SIPDIS

STATE PLEASE PASS TO WHITE HOUSE FOR THE PRESIDENT

EO 12958 DECL: 07/06/2019

TAGS PREL, OVIP, ECON, EFIN, PINR, MOPS, NL

SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS: OVERVIEW FOR THE PRESIDENT'S JULY 14

MEETING WITH DUTCH PRIME MINISTER BALKENENDE

Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Michael F. Gallagher for reasons 1.4 ( b) and (d).

Mr. President:

1. (C) Your July 14 meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Jan Pieter Balkenende provides an opportunity for us to urge the Dutch to continue as part of NATO in Afghanistan and to enlist PM Balkenende in solving Guantanamo issues. For his part, Balkenende will seek to continue the Dutch role in the G20 and to find a common ground to work with us on climate change and the Middle East.

2. (C) Balkenende, in office through four coalitions since 2002, is a cunning politician who does not impose his vision on coalition partners, but maneuvers effectively to achieve the intended goal. At first, he was dismissed as a lightweight ""Harry Potter"" look-alike, but he has consistently and skillfully delivered Cabinet support for U.S. policy objectives while balancing fragile parliamentary majorities. Balkenende,s current center-left coalition government (""Balkenende IV"") is held together more by fear of early elections than any unity of vision. The financial crisis has plunged the Netherlands into a recession likely to last through 2010, and the Cabinet must continually defend its three relatively modest stimulus packages against calls to do more to spur recovery. Balkenende is also under pressure from a skeptical public to withdraw the Netherlands, 1,800 troops from Afghanistan in 2010. His main coalition partner, the Labor Party, is in decline, having fared poorly in the 2006 national election and the 2009 European Parliament election, and believes rejecting a continuing role in Afghanistan will please its base and may win back supporters.

3. (S) The Wilders Factor: Golden-pompadoured, maverick parliamentarian Geert Wilders, anti-Islam, nationalist Freedom Party remains a thorn in the coalition's side, capitalizing on the social stresses resulting from the failure to fully integrate almost a million Dutch Muslims, mostly of Moroccan or Turkish descent. In existence only since 2006, the Freedom Party, tightly controlled by Wilders, has grown to be the Netherlands second largest, and fastest growing, party. Recent polls suggest it could even replace Balkenende,s Christian Democrats as the top party in 2011 parliamentary elections. Wilders is no friend of the U.S.: he opposes Dutch military involvement in Afghanistan; he believes development assistance is money wasted; he opposes NATO missions outside ""allied"" territory; he is against most EU initiatives; and, most troubling, he forments fear and hatred of immigrants.

4. (C) As a result of these currents, Balkenende,s coalition finds itself in a precarious position and could fall within a year (most likely after municipal elections in March 2010). The Prime Minister is aware we want him to deliver continued Dutch boots on the ground in Afghanistan after 2010 and help with Guantanamo detainees. He knows there are high risks/expectations involved in his meeting with you, but we understand he is coming to offer as much as he thinks he can deliver at this time.

5. (S) Balkenende, a long-time champion of U.S.-Dutch relations, seeks to establish a strong relationship with you and capitalize on your popularity. The Dutch public overwhelmingly supported your election in November, and you remain hugely popular here as a beacon of change. Balkenende Qremain hugely popular here as a beacon of change. Balkenende will encourage you to view the long arc of the U.S.-Dutch relationship, not just current bumps in the road (e.g. the likely drawdown of Dutch forces in Afghanistan after 2010). He wants you to see the Netherlands as America,s friend and partner, with significant Dutch contributions to our shared foreign policy priorities: Dutch military presence in Afghanistan and support for NATO; support for U.S. intervention in Iraq; active participation in the EU, NATO, and other multilateral institutions; substantial and sustained foreign development assistance; and a long-standing commitment to promoting human rights, tolerance, and the rule of law. And, he will ask you for a seat at the G-20 table in Pittsburgh as well as for a meeting at the White House in September for the Crown Prince.

6. (C) Balkenende will use your private, one-on-one session to highlight your shared personal values and experiences. He believes social organizations are more effective in promoting change than government. His philosophy is that we must treat

THE HAGUE 00000395 002 OF 002

one another with dignity and respect as we live and work together. Your Father,s Day call for fathers to accept more responsibility in the rearing of their children resonated with him. Balkenende will also likely use the one-on-one session to pinpoint the political difficulties of the deliverables we are seeking. Rather than cover a laundry list of topics, the Dutch want the larger meeting to focus on 1) Afghanistan/Pakistan, 2) the future of the global economic system (including the role of the G20 and how to help developing countries), 3) the Middle East Peace Process/Iran, and 4) climate change. The Prime Minister is anticipating other key foreign policy issues (e.g. human rights, Russia, NATO, non-proliferation, energy security, 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson,s voyage to Manhattan - NY400) can be covered by staff or only briefly mentioned to stay focused on the major issues. Two cables will follow which will expand on these topics.

The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility, saying it had shot down the plane, but NATO has consistently rejected that, saying there was no insurgent activity in the area. Nangyalai Qalatwal, the spokesman for the Afghan aviation body, said only a few words of the pilot`s voice could be understood on the flight recording. Even so, the crash was ruled an accident. ""What is clear for us after this investigation is that the claim of responsibility for the Taliban is false,"" Qalatwal said on Monday. ""There was no sound of any rocket attack or any insurgent involvement in that crash. It was only an accident."" He noted that the plane was inspected only two hours before its takeoff and was found to have no technical problems. The American investigators took the flight recorder with them when they returned home, and Qalatwal said it could take up to a year to determine the exact cause. The plane owned by National Airlines, an Orlando, Florida-based subsidiary of National Air Cargo, was carrying vehicles and other cargo. Six of the dead Americans were from Michigan and the seventh was from Kentucky, said Shirley Kaufman, a National Air Cargo vice president. PTI",Q1
http://freebeacon.com/haqqani-network-hit-in-drone-strike/,Haqqani Network Hit in Drone Strike,"The CIA on Wednesday carried out a major unmanned aircraft attack on a house in northern Pakistan and killed 17 suspected terrorists linked to the Haqqani Network, according to a Pakistani think tank.

The drone attack involved four missiles fired into a residence in the town of Miran Shah, located in North Waziristan, Pakistan, about 35 miles south of the Afghan city of Khost, the Islamabad-based FATA Research Center reported.

The center stated in a report that the drone launched missiles on a house in the Sarai Darpakhel area of the Miranshah Bazaar around 2 a.m. local time, destroying the residence.

A CIA spokesman declined to comment.

Quoting Pakistani officials and locals, the report said 17 militants were killed in the strike. The officials did not identify the dead.

One official said the militants hit in the attack were a mixture of local and foreign militants.

An eyewitness reported that militants took control of the area and blocked people from reaching the site.

According to the center, the area has been a target of past drone attacks.

North Waziristan is a major operating region for several terrorist groups active in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They include the Haji Gul Bahadur Group, the Haqqani Network, and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

""According to intelligence officials, the Haqqani Network members were targeted in this attack, which is considered as a staunch enemy by the western allies in the war against terror,"" the center's report said.

It was the first reported attack in July.

Ten terrorists were killed in a June 7 drone strike on a compound in Mangroti, a village of Tehsil Shawal in North Waziristan.

Pakistan officially opposes the CIA-U.S. military drone strikes but has allowed them to take place.

Armed drone attacks by both Predator and Reaper UAVs have become the main feature of the Obama administration’s covert war on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, notably in remote regions of Pakistan where al Qaeda has its main headquarters.

Counterterrorism officials have said that as a result of the drone strikes, which have killed scores if not hundreds of terrorists over the past decade, al Qaeda terrorists have moved to other regions, including the Horn of Africa and North Africa where the group is expanding its numbers.

Pakistan continues to face Islamist terror attacks, carried out mainly by Sunni groups including the Pakistani Taliban, Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ).

Late last month the Pakistani Taliban attempted to bomb a Pakistani judge, Maqbool Baqir, with a remote-controlled bomb. The blast injured the judge and several others, and killed six police officers.

Pakistani officials have blamed the domestic terror attacks on covert government support for U.S. drone strikes.

However, U.S. officials say the problem of terrorism is an outgrowth of Pakistani ISI intelligence support for extremist groups. The ISI’s Directorate S is known by U.S. intelligence agencies to be the key driver of support for Islamist terror groups in Pakistan as well as Afghanistan.

Relations between the CIA and ISI were disrupted following the May 2011 U.S. military raid in Abbatobad, Pakistan, that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

But the drone strikes have continued, as shown in Wednesday’s attack.",Q1

""We cannot find any justification for these killings. There are genuine threats to the USA and its allies in the region, and drone strikes may be lawful in some circumstances,"" said Mustafa Qadri, Amnesty International's Pakistan researcher. ""But it is hard to believe that a group of labourers, or an elderly woman surrounded by her grandchildren, were endangering anyone at all, let alone posing an imminent threat to the United States.""

Amnesty called on the US to comply with its obligations under international law by investigating the killings documented in the report and providing victims with ""full reparation.""

The US carried out its first drone strike in Pakistan in 2004 and has launched nearly 350 more since, most in North Waziristan, a major militant sanctuary near the Afghan border. President Barack Obama significantly increased attacks when he took office in 2009, and the number peaked the following year with over 100 strikes. The frequency has steadily dropped since, partly because of growing tension between Pakistan and the US There have only been around two dozen strikes so far this year.

Pakistani officials regularly denounce the attacks in public as a violation of the country's sovereignty, but senior members of the government and the military are known to have supported them in the past.

""Amnesty International is also extremely concerned about the failure of the Pakistani authorities to protect and enforce the rights of victims of drone strikes,"" said the report. ""Pakistan has a duty to independently and impartially investigate all drone strikes in the country and ensure access to justice and reparation for victims of violations.""

Amnesty said victims they interviewed with no apparent connection to militant groups have either received no compensation or inadequate assistance from the Pakistani government.

Relatives of 68-year-old grandmother Mamana Bibi told Amnesty she was killed by a missile in October last year as she was collecting vegetables in a family field in the North Waziristan tribal area,. Three of her grandchildren were wounded in the strike.

The US considers its drone programme to be a key weapon against insurgent groups that it says stages cross-border forays into neighbouring Afghanistan. But the belief, widespread in Pakistan, that the strikes kill large numbers of civilians sparks resentment and complicates the two countries' ability to coordinate efforts against militants based in the country, including al-Qaida.

An even deadlier incident noted by the report - titled ""'Will I be next?' US drone strikes in Pakistan""- occurred in North Waziristan in July last year. Witnesses said a volley of missiles hit a tent where a group of men had gathered for an evening meal after work, and then a second struck those who came to help the wounded, one of a number of attacks that have hit rescuers, the rights group said.

Witnesses and relatives said that total of 18 male labourers with no links to militant groups died, according to Amnesty. Pakistani intelligence officials at the time identified the dead as suspected militants.

http://www.mintpressnews.com/federal-governments-disclosure-of-area-51-may-reflect-shift-in-federal-policy/167701/,Disclosure Of Area 51 May Reflect Shift In Federal Policy,"Last week, the United States government did something that millions of conspiracy theorists worldwide never imagined would happen. Unclassified documents obtained by George Washington University’s National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act disclosed, for the first time publicly, federal government acknowledgement of the remote detachment of Edwards Air Force Base at Groom Lake, Nevada — also known as Area 51.

The files disclosed the existence of two unmanned CIA aerial reconnaissance programs — AQUILINE and AXILLARY — that were being developed at the Nevada black site in the early 1960s. The existence of unmanned drones 50 years before their publicized entrance into battlefield operations has nearly matched — in scope — the significance of the Area 51 revelation.

However, the most shocking aspect of this revelation may be the fact that there was a revelation in the first place.

A black site is a classified facility or installation where “black projects,” military or intelligence operations that are publicly disavowed by the government, are conducted. Since the establishment of Area 51 in the 1950s, speculations and innuendos concerning the activities of the classified airstrip have fueled countless books, movies and television series and have served as the backbone of an entire UFO conspiracy industry. The government’s secrecy about the site only exaggerated the rumors about the site.

According to the documentation, Area 51 was merely the testing site for the government’s U-2 and OXCART aerial surveillance projects. Other projects, such as the AQUILINE and AXILLARY were also revealed in the documentation to have been developed at the base, and while not explicitly disclosed in the nearly 400 pages brief, it is thought that most of the military’s special purpose aircraft, such as the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, were tested out of Groom Lake.

Genesis of the American drone program

In light of international embarrassment concerning the shooting down of U-2 spy planes in Soviet Union-controlled airspace — including the capture of American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers in 1960, the CIA needed a surveillance vehicle that was unmanned and small enough not to be detected.

The first project, AQUILINE, was developed in 1965 from Douglas Aircraft’s response to a call for proposals for a small, unmanned drone. “The AQUILINE prototype developed by Douglas Aircraft . . . was essentially a powered glider with an 8.5-foot wingspan,” the disclosed documents read. “The aircraft weighed only 105 pounds. AQUILINE’s tail-mounted engine drove a two-bladed propeller.” A 3.5 horsepower chain saw engine powered the drone’s propellers.

The CIA developed the AXILLARY project in conjunction with the AQUILINE project. The design of AXILLARY made it too large and too loud for spy missions. However, the possibility of the project as an unmanned bombing platform kept the project funded.

“The radar homing system proved successful as AXILLARY sought out and destroyed a radar during testing at China Lake Naval Air Station,” the documents read. “However, the end of U.S. involvement in Vietnam in early 1973 led to the cancellation of DOD funding.”

Ultimately, the cost of the projects led to their failure. The difficulties in landing the drones — which was only recently resolved — made the drones a continuing headaches in repair costs. “One or more of the aircraft was always being repaired, and eventually three of the five AQUILINE prototypes were destroyed in testing,” said the documents. Despite this, one or both of the prototypes flew out of Area 51 more than 20 times.

Stall tactics

This revelation about the nation’s drone program development underlies the seriousness involved in the recognition of the nation’s best known black site. Despite allegations that the federal government’s cover-up of aliens and UFOs is centered at the base, Area 51 is vitally important to the current discussion of national security in large part due to the extent the government protected its secret prior to disclosure. In litigations in the 1990s concerning the burning of discarded and classified equipment and hazardous waste at Area 51, which exposed workers to dangerous fumes, the government did everything within its power to deny existence of the Groom Lake facility.

“The first hurdle was the government’s refusal to acknowledge even the existence, let alone the name, of the facility,” wrote Jonathan Turley, the lead counsel in the Area 51 litigation, in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times. “We supplied pictures of the base. We supplied affidavits from workers at the base. We even submitted pictures of planes taking off in Las Vegas and then the same planes landing at Area 51. At one point, I offered to drive the judge personally to the base and point at it from a mountaintop. (The government then acquired the mountaintop and barred the public.) Ultimately, the government confirmed the existence of the base only after we located Russian satellite pictures. It turned out that the Russians had a virtual catalog of pictures of Area 51 for public sale. You just needed a credit card.”

“In the end, we prevailed in demonstrating that the government had acted in violation of federal law. However, the government refused to declassify information about what it had burned in the trenches, which meant that workers (and their doctors) still didn’t know what they had been exposed to. The government also refused to acknowledge the name of the base.”

Reasons for disclosure

Disclosure of Area 51 came after the statute of limitations for any acts of malfeasance that may have occurred there had expired. This begs an interesting question as to why exactly the federal government held on to what was basically an open secret for so long. This is compounded by speculation that Area 51 hasn’t hosted a “black project” in years.

“Area 51 has been in existence for over 50 years. A ‘secret’ can only stay a secret for so long. That being said, Area 51 is no longer a black site and understandably so,” said Jared Nichols, futurist and president of the Jared Nichols Group, in conversation with Mint Press News. “We have to consider the context before speculating on the ‘why.’ Area 51 was a top secret testing ground for gaining competitive advantage during the Cold War. The nature of warfare has drastically changed since then. In 2012, roughly 10 percent ($51 billion) of our total defense budget was allocated to black budget projects.“

“These projects are geared toward modern clandestine operations, cyber warfare and other forms of R&D such as genetic research and artificial intelligence, which by the way, require a lot less geographical space for testing. That being said, black sites like Area 51 are no longer necessary.”

However, it can be argued that the revelation concerning Area 51 came as the result of reform to the intelligence community. Starting in 2004, the Department of Defense started to implement procedures meant to codify the operation procedures of the nation’s black sites, or Special Access Programs, which, prior to this, operated at the discretion of the Pentagon. These reforms include the establishment of improved auditing and reporting systems, a new focus on budget adherence and regular classification reviews of controlled information and documentation. However, in light of criticism that the intelligence community is being allowed to skirt the law — particularly in light of the 2011 revelation that the CIA ran a network of black site prisons in Afghanistan or recent revelations that the National Security Agency has been eavesdropping on domestic communiqués, the Obama administration has embraced a policy of open disclosure of non-essential “secrets.”

“No one knows for sure why the US government admitted that Area 51 is real — the government’s motive is itself a matter of speculation,” said Paul Levinson, professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University, to Mint Press News. “My own view is that the admission is part of a larger strategy by the Obama administration of trying to be less secretive, wherever possible. In view of leaks that the NSA has been secretly spying on Americans, the government wants to do whatever it can to show it is keeping as little as possible secret from Americans.”

Levinson pointed out that since Area 51 was an open secret, the government lost nothing in its disclosure.

Throwing the public a bone

This call for fewer secrets comes in the wake of admissions of gross intelligence overreaches and miscalculations. These include revelations that the NSA collected the text of non-terrorism related emails from Americans in 2008 and the publicized allegations that the Bush-era rendition program — which saw the abduction and detention of terrorist suspects outside and beyond American jurisdiction — has survived into the Obama administration and has been expanded to include 54 foreign governments and two high-profile national secrets leaks.

Considering all of this, there is the hope that the government may be turning a corner — walking away from the honeycomb of secrets and clandestine actions that defined the intelligence community during the Cold War toward a more open approach to international politics. However, taking into account increasing CIA involvement in foreign engagements — including the expanding use of drones — this hope seems far-fetched.

It is more reasonable to presume that the disclosure of Area 51 was diversionary — designed to take focus off an embarrassing issue, such as the continuing problems with the intelligence community, with something flashy but meaningless. In lights of recent failures to reform the USA PATRIOT Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act toward offering more privacy protection to American citizens — most recently, the defeat of Rep. Justin Amash’s (R – Cascade Township) amendment to the 2013 Defense Appropriations Bill — and a lack of motivation from Washington’s leadership to alleviate public concerns, ultimately, some token needed to be offered to the people.

“There is a key principle to keep in mind and that is the U.S. Government, like all entities, and the agencies that operate within it are driven by self preservation,” Nichols stated with regard to the nature of the Area 51 disclosure. “This is what you could call ‘throwing the public a bone.’”",Q1

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/03/bradley-manning-trial_n_3376577.html,Bradley Manning Trial Begins,"WASHINGTON -- Three years ago the transparency website WikiLeaks released a video of a U.S. Apache helicopter gunning down Reuters journalists on a Baghdad street.

It was just one chilling public revelation from a cache of 700,000 documents a young Army private first class named Bradley Manning gave the site. Soon after would follow sobering field reports from the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, and candid diplomatic cables from the U.S. Department of State.

Advertisement

To Icelandic parliamentarian Birgitta Jónsdóttir, Manning is ""an embodiment of what sort of person I would like to be."" An activist as well as a politician, she helped edit the so-called ""Collateral Murder"" gun cam video.

""I would like to have the same courage, the same sense of justice, the same integrity as Bradley Manning,"" she said. ""He in my opinion is in the exact category as [Pentagon Papers whistle-blower] Daniel Ellsberg and other fighters for freedom of expression.""

On Monday, Manning's trial begins. The 25-year-old faces life in prison for his leaks. The potential implications of the proceedings on this sprawling military base outside Washington, D.C. go far beyond his fate alone.

Advertisement

The most serious charge the government has laid against Manning is aiding the enemy. The charge rests on the novel legal theory that Manning should have known that his disclosures could wind up in the hands of Osama bin Laden -- as they apparently did.

In a cruel twist, then, Manning's decision to release the files that included the video of Reuters journalists being killed threatens to criminalize both journalism and whistle-blowing.

""The case is a sledgehammer,"" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told HuffPost last week. ""It is there to try and terrorize anyone else into being a force for the media, by trying to terrorize this young man.""

Manning's road to trial began on May 29, 2010, when he was arrested at Forward Operating Base Hammer in Iraq. He was eventually transferred to a Marine brig in Quantico, Va, where he was held for nine months.

Forced to strip naked at night, kept in solitary confinement under the unrelenting glare of guards because they alleged he was a suicide risk, some have described Manning's treatment at Quantico as similar to that of detainees at Guantanamo. It sparked an international outcry.

Col. Denise Lind, the military judge overseeing the case, ruled in January that the military's treatment of Manning in pretrial detention was ""excessive"" and gave him 112 days credit off any eventual prison sentence.

PJ Crowley, the former State Department spokesman who was forced to resign after he decried Manning's treatment, has warned the trial threatens to once again turn him into a martyr. But he has no respect for what the soldier did.

""Bradley Manning's responsibility as a member of the military was to protect the national interest,"" he said. ""It was not Bradley Manning's job to define the national interest.""

In other pretrial rulings, Lind has also held that the government must prove that Manning had reason to believe that his disclosures could have harmed the United States. On the controversial aiding the enemy charge, she has ruled that the government will have to show ""that the accused had to know he was dealing, directly or indirectly, with an enemy of the United States.""

Advertisement

""I think it will be hard to prove,"" David Frakt, a visiting professor at University of Pittsburgh School of Law, wrote in an email. He believes Manning may be able to beat the aiding the enemy charge.

If he can't, press freedom advocates have warned, the ability of other news organizations to report on classified information may be in jeopardy. The case is now occurring in the context of the subpoenas issued for Associated Press and Fox News phone records. Government prosecutors have said they would have charged Manning no differently if he had leaked directly to The New York Times.

""If successful, the prosecution will establish a chilling precedent: national security leaks may subject the leakers to a capital prosecution or at least life imprisonment,"" lawyers Floyd Abrams and Yochai Benkler wrote in The New York Times in March. ""Anyone who holds freedom of the press dear should shudder at the threat that the prosecution’s theory presents to journalists, their sources and the public that relies on them.""

Advertisement

The case has already been marred by public access problems: Lind and the military have kept transcripts, motions and rulings in the case secret. A coalition of activists and journalists is suing to open up access to records in the trial.

In response to the government's charges, Manning's lawyer David Coombs will likely argue that his client thought of himself as a whistle-blower. In his February plea statement, Manning said he wanted to ""spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan.""

But that kind of argument may only go so far with Lind, who under military law has wide latitude to impose whatever sentence she deems appropriate. Manning has chosen to eschew a jury trial, likely to avoid the added uncertainty it could bring, said military justice expert Eugene R. Fidell.

%22Wired%22 report says Sigurdur Thordarson is %22prone to lying%22 but has supporting documents

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has been charged in a sex assault case in Sweden

Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London

A key WikiLeaks staff member in Iceland spent three months in 2011 spying for the FBI on the transparency group and its founder, Julian Assange, Wired reported Thursday.

Sigurdur Thordarson, who access to Assange and was an organizer, told Kevin Poulsen that the FBI paid him about $5,000 for his three months as an informant when he was 18 years old. He said that the FBI flew him out of Iceland for four debriefings, including one in Washington, D.C., and that he turned over eight hard drives full of WikiLeaks chat logs, video and other data.

He joined WikiLeaks in 2010 while in high school after the organization published bank documents that shed light on Iceland's financial collapse. Poulsen writes that after a ""staff revolt"" left the group short-handed, ""Assange put Thordarson in charge of the WikiLeaks chat room, making Thordarson the first point of contact for new volunteers, journalists, potential sources, and outside groups clamoring to get in with WikiLeaks at the peak of its notoriety.""

Thordarson began informing in August 2011, when he walked into the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, with a photocopy of Assange's Australian passport.

Poulsen, a hacking legend who served prison time for his ""black hat"" exploits in the 1990s, writes that Thordarson ""provides a rare window into the U.S. law enforcement investigation into WikiLeaks.""

Thordarson's double-life illustrates the lengths to which the government was willing to go in its pursuit of Julian Assange, approaching WikiLeaks with the tactics honed during the FBI's work against organized crime and computer hacking — or, more darkly, the bureau's Hoover-era infiltration of civil rights groups.

Noting ""a hurdle"" in reporting on Thordarson, Poulsen writes that he ""is prone to lying"" but handed over e-mails and other documents that allegedly corroborate his claims:

He admits he has lied to me in the past. For this story, Thordarson backed his account by providing emails that appear to be between him and his FBI handlers, flight records for some of his travels, and an FBI receipt indicating that he gave them eight hard drives. The Icelandic Ministry of the Interior has previously confirmed that the FBI flew to Iceland to interview Thordarson. Thordarson also testified to much of this account in a session of the Icelandic Parliament, with [lawmaker Birgitta] Jonsdottir in attendance.

Finally, he has given me a substantial subset of the chat logs he says he passed to the FBI, amounting to about 2,000 pages, which, at the very least, proves that he kept logs and is willing to turn them over to a reporter disliked by Julian Assange.

The FBI declined to comment to Wired and USA TODAY.

For the past year, Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden for a sexual assault investigation or possibly to the United States because of WikiLeaks' notable disclosures of classified documents involving Iraq, Afghanistan and U.S. foreign policy. Ecuador granted him political asylum last August.

Assange has been assisting NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who has also asked Ecuador for asylum but remains stranded in a Moscow airport after fleeing Hong Kong last week.

http://www.dawn.com/news/1061778/ppp-walks-out-of-na-to-defend-bhutto-legacy,PPP walks out of NA to defend Bhutto legacy,"ISLAMABAD, Dec 10: In defence of what it sees as pro-labour legacy of its founder, executed former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) walked out of the National Assembly on Tuesday in protest against planned privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state enterprises.

In a sign of growing tensions between the country’s two main political parties, opposition leader Khursheed Ahmed Shah accused the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) government of seeking to restore an economic stranglehold of the so-called “22 families” of the rich elite that Mr Bhutto’s nationalisation of the 1970s had clipped, as he led PPP lawmakers out of the house.

It was the second day running of bitterness between the six-month-old government and the previously ruling PPP as the PML-N seemed seeking to detract attention from widespread protests against high prices of essential commodities by discrediting Mr Bhutto and the subsequent two short-lived prime ministerial tenures of his assassinated daughter, Benazir Bhutto.

After the prime minister attacked Mr Bhutto’s nationalisation policy in a speech in Islamabad on Saturday, the issue first drew angry exchanges between the rival sides in the house during a heated debate on prices on Monday. The issue echoed in the house again on Tuesday during a discussion on PIA’s performance and the projected sale of 26 per cent of its shares — a move opposed by several opposition lawmakers who suggested that the government better fix the airline rather than selling what some called a national silver.

In what was seen as the strongest PPP outburst against the present government following frequent assurances of cooperation over the past six months of its life, Mr Shah accused the PML-N of working against the interest of labour “whenever it comes to power” and, asked whether the party “is an enemy of labour?”

He said the projected privatisation of 89 state enterprises was meant to benefit favourites among “20 families” on the lines of some previous sales like that of Muslim Commercial Bank by a previous PML-N government and of Habib Bank, United Bank and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd during the military-led rule of Pervez Musharraf.

“Now you are going to make a deal to benefit another such family,” Mr Shah said about the proposed PIA deal. And, while referring to the planned privatisation of loss-making Pakistan Steel Mills, built by the then Soviet Union during the Bhutto government, he said: “Self-respecting nations bring even dead things to life. Would you kill a sick relative by injection (instead of treating the ailment)?”

Conceding that Mr Bhutto might have made mistakes, Mr Shah asserted that the former prime minister never let the poor down, and in a veiled jibe at the PML-N chief’s deal with General Musharraf in 2001 for exile in Saudi Arabia to escape jail, he said Mr Bhutto could also seek pardon from military president Ziaul Haq and live in exile in Dubai, Qatar or London but he went to the gallows in 1979, on a disputed conspiracy-to-murder conviction.

From the government side, while speaking on a motion moved by a PML-N member from Punjab province, Shaikh Rohale Asghar, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Sheikh Aftab Ahmed earlier assured the house that no PIA employees would be laid off as a consequence of privatisation. But he was greeted with “no, no” shouts from PPP benches when he said that “we want to privatise 26 per cent shares” of the national carrier. But he did not seem to favour demands from Mr Asghar and some opposition members for setting up a house committee to examine PIA affairs and suggest remedies for its losses.

Earlier also, the government came under fire from opposition benches for allegedly mishandling the country’s economic situation during what was comparatively a sober debate before the house passed a resolution moved by a PTI member from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province urging the government to “take effective steps to alleviate poverty”.

DRONE ATTACKS: The house passed another resolution tabled by three members of the government-allied Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F “strongly” condemning what it called drone attacks by “allied forces” on Pakistani tribal areas after Minister for States and Frontier Regions Abdul Qadir Baloch assured it that the government had reiterated its own position against such strikes in Monday’s talks with visiting US Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel.

But the minister’s speech provoked protests from PTI benches after he accused the party of taking an immature and sentimental approach in staging sit-ins to block Nato supplies to and from Afghanistan via PTI-ruled Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province without regard to what he called “ground realities”.",Q1

Taliban releases 'pointless' for Afghan peace

by Staff Writers

Kabul (AFP) Sept 14, 2013





Gunmen torch NATO tankers, kill driver in Pakistan

Quetta, Pakistan (AFP) Sept 13, 2013 - Gunmen attacked a convoy of NATO oil tankers in southwest Pakistan overnight, killing a driver and torching eight vehicles, local officials said Friday. Quetta, Pakistan (AFP) Sept 13, 2013 - Gunmen attacked a convoy of NATO oil tankers in southwest Pakistan overnight, killing a driver and torching eight vehicles, local officials said Friday. The attackers fired rockets and bullets at the convoy of 15 oil tankers travelling from Pakistan's main Arabian sea port of Karachi to landlocked Afghanistan. The attack happened around 300 kilometres (190 miles) from Quetta, the capital of the insurgency-torn southwestern province of Baluchistan that borders Afghanistan and Iran. ""The gunmen attacked the convoy at a rest stop in Soorab town of Kallat district. They fired rockets and bullets on the convoy from both sides of the road,"" police official Yousaf Reiki said. ""One Pakistani driver of a tanker died in the attack while eight tankers were burnt,"" he added. Senior administration official Muhammad Akbar confirmed the attack. There was no claim of responsibility but the Taliban have in the past said they carry out such attacks to disrupt supplies for US-led NATO troops fighting in Afghanistan. The NATO combat mission is due to end next year. Pakistan and the United States have signed a deal allowing NATO supply convoys to travel into Afghanistan until the end of 2015. Afghan officials say Pakistan's release of 33 Taliban prisoners from jail, a policy initially trumpeted by Kabul as an opportunity to ignite peace talks, has resulted in no concrete progress. The Afghan government, desperately searching for a way to negotiate peace before NATO troops leave next year, has said that the release of influential insurgents could encourage their comrades to the negotiating table. But despite the 33 Afghan Taliban prisoners released by Pakistan and dozens of others freed in Afghanistan, there is still no peace process and some fighters have returned to the battlefield. The Taliban still refuse publicly to deal with the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, branding him a US puppet. They have also shown no willingness to participate in elections on April 5, 2014 when Karzai will step aside for a new leader for the first time since the 2001 US-led invasion. Instead their readiness to negotiate with the Americans about a prisoner swap has only infuriated Karzai, who late last month asked Pakistan to help find a direct channel of communication. In parts of Afghanistan, which continue to suffer daily from Taliban violence, the releases have been met with incomprehension if not anger by local government officials. ""The Taliban who are released... rejoin the battlefield again,"" said Zurawar Zahid, police chief of the flashpoint southern province of Ghazni. ""We put our lives in danger to arrest them, but the central government releases them under different pretences,"" he added. Zahid told AFP that more than 40 Taliban, including some senior commanders, who were recently freed from Ghazni central prison on Karzai's orders have gone back to the battlefield. Mohammad Ali Ahmadi, deputy provincial governor of Ghazni, also believes that the Taliban releases have done nothing to help. ""The people who are behind killings, bombings, killing innocent civilians and government officials should be punished. ""The central government knows they will rejoin the Taliban again after they are released, it is not going to help the peace process,"" he said. Afghans have also complained about the manner in which the Pakistanis have released the detainees -- without any warning and without delivering them to Afghan authorities. ""We don't even know what happens to them after they're released,"" said Ismail Qasimyar, a senior member of the High Peace Council set up to reach out to the Taliban. ""When they decide to free Taliban, they only inform the Afghan government a few hours before,"" he added. ""The Taliban releases by Pakistan have not been effective for the Afghanistan peace process,"" he said. Pakistan now says it intends to release its most senior Afghan Taliban detainee, former military leader Abdul Ghani Baradar who has been described as number two to supreme leader Mullah Omar. He was picked up by Pakistani and American agents in Karachi in early 2010. Afghan and US officials at the time accused Pakistan of sabotaging peace efforts by arresting the reputed moderate. But nearly four years later, the consequences of his release are deeply uncertain. ""He is no longer as important for the Taliban as he used to be before being arrested,"" said Pakistani militancy expert Rahimullah Yusufzai. ""Nor will it (the Taliban) accept him as a mediator. The Taliban would rather like to watch him before assigning him any role. ""But I don't think Baradar will be assigned the kind of role that the US and Karzai administrations expect him to be given -- to mediate between Kabul and the Taliban,"" Yusufzai added. Rather than benefiting peace talks, the releases have perhaps been limited to an attempt to re-establish trust between Kabul and Islamabad, whose relations are clouded by deep distrust. Both trade blame over the Taliban militants threatening security in both countries, and Kabul accuses elements of the Pakistani state of funding, controlling and sheltering the Afghan Taliban. Islamabad says publicly it will do anything to stop the fighting in Afghanistan. ""It will definitely send strong signals that Pakistan is contributing positively to the peace process,"" retired Pakistani general Talat Masood told AFP. ""However, this release is not likely to make any significant difference in the negotiating process,"" he added. .

http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-139173-Obama-warns-Karzai-of-full-troop-withdrawal,Debris another headache for city dwellers,"Rawalpindi : Although the demolition squads with big shovel, sledgehammer, trowel, excavators and other heavy machinery tore down the extended shades and platforms of shops as part of operation against encroachments in the city and cantonment areas, but nobody bothered to remove the debris left by the operations. Neither authorities’ concerned nor affected shopkeepers are trying to remove ‘debris’, which is creating traffic problems in many localities.

It is worth mentioning here that several building owners after demolishing their encroachments themselves so as to avoid action by civic authorities. The most affected areas are Saddar Railway Road, Adiala Road, Jhanda Chichi, Defense Road, Tahli Morri, City Saddar Road, Asghar Mall Road, Jamia Masjid Road, Lalkurti, Chungi No.22, Tench Bhatta, Dhoke Syedan, Misriyal Road, Chur, Tehmasabad and several other localities where debris is spread on roads creating disturbance for traffic and even pedestrians.

The Chief Officer (CO) Potohar Town Kamran Khan told ‘The News’ that it was necessary to remove all debris from road sides to free movement of traffic flow. It was the duty of shopkeepers to immediately remove debris from the sites otherwise they would be slapped with fine, he warned. Rawalpindi Development Authority, Rawalpindi Cantonment Board and Chaklala Cantonment Board, Municipal Corporation Rawalpindi (MCR) and Potohar Town have torn down numerous encroachments in the markets and commercial and residential areas across the city. Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) Secretary Rana Amanullah Khan said that they have formed a special team to remove debris from the sites. “We have received several complaints of public regarding to remove debris after the operation,” he said.

According to data collected from different departments, demolition squads of RCB took down nearly 800 illegal shades and illegally built cemented extensions of shops. The concerned department had earlier issued notices asking shopkeepers to remove encroachments on their own or strict action would be taken.

Similarly, demolition squads of Potohar Town have removed around 400 illegal shades of shops and plazas. The department also broken over 500 feet encroached pathways. The demolition squads of CCB has taken down nearly 400 illegal shades of shops while Rawalpindi Development Authority and Municipal Corporation Rawalpindi have took down around 1000 illegal shades of shops in different localities. Municipal Corporation Rawalpindi (MCR) Chief Officer Syed Shafqat Raza said that operation will continue till removal of all kinds of illegal constructions. The violators intentionally are not removing debris after operation, we will take strict action against them, he warned.",Q1

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia CNN —

Where do you even begin to look, when the search area covers vast swaths of land and water, stretching thousands of miles, from Kazakhstan to the Indian Ocean?

That’s the question for Malaysian officials and authorities from 24 other nations as people search for a ninth day, trying to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the 239 people on board.

As the search area grows bigger, authorities are also increasing their scrutiny of the pilots, searching their homes in the quest for clues. That includes a flight simulator from the captain’s home.

It also includes interviewing the engineers who were in contact with MH370 before it took off, according to a statement from acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein to BERNAMA, Malaysia’s official news agency. The transport minister characterized the interviews as “normal procedure.”

“Police are still working on it. … Nothing conclusive yet,” a senior police official who has direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Sunday night, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak to the press.

With news that the Boeing 777-200ER might have flown for six and a half hours after its transponder stopped sending signals March 8, officials said the expanding search area extends over 11 countries, stretching as far north as Kazakhstan, a large nation in Central Asia far from any ocean.

“This is a significant recalibration of the search,” Malaysia’s acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday.

There are still more questions than answers about the missing flight. Figuring out the motive of whoever apparently steered the plane off course is key, analysts told CNN Sunday.

“I think they had an end game in mind from the very beginning,” CNN aviation analyst Jim Tilmon said, “and they have executed a lot of things that have led us down a road. Are we going to the right place? I’m not sure.”

The plane disappeared on March 8, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Airline CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Sunday the missing passenger jet took off with its normal amount of fuel needed for the roughly six-hour flight and did not have extra fuel on board that could have extended its range.

One of the nations involved in the search, Pakistan, said Sunday that the plane never showed up on its civilian radars and would have been treated as a threat if it had.

The Times of India reported that India’s military also said there was no way the plane could have flown over India without being picked up on radar.

A study of the flight’s cargo manifest showed there were no dangerous materials on board that concerned investigators, he told reporters.

Investigators are still looking into the backgrounds of the passengers to see whether any of them were trained pilots.

“There are still a few countries who have yet to respond to our request for a background check,” said Khalid Abu Bakar, inspector general of the Royal Malaysian Police Force. “But there are a few … foreign intelligence agencies who have cleared all the(ir) passengers.”

U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that “those in the cockpit” – the captain and co-pilot – were responsible for the mysterious disappearance, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told CNN.

The official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date.

Other scenarios could still emerge. The notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out, the official said Saturday.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters on Saturday that the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board.

‘Someone acting deliberately’

The first clue that the captain or co-pilot may have been involved stems from when the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn just after it last communicated with Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers, and before it would have to communicate with Vietnamese controllers, according to the U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking.

“This is the perfect place to start to disappear,” the official said.

Adding to the intrigue, ABC News reported that the dramatic left turn was preprogrammed into the plane’s navigation computer. It’s a task that would have required extensive piloting experience.

Two senior law enforcement officials also told ABC that new information revealed the plane performed “tactical evasion maneuvers” after it disappeared from radar. CNN was unable to confirm these reports.

Military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian Peninsula, Najib said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, he said.

“Evidence is consistent with someone acting deliberately from inside the plane,” the Prime Minister said, officially confirming the plane’s disappearance was not caused by an accident. “Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, we are investigating all major possibilities on what caused MH370 to deviate.”

The unconfirmed possibility that the plane could be on land means authorities need to answer that question – and fast, analysts said.

“Time is even more of the essence. If this airplane has been taken to be used as a weapon, then the time that has been taken to prepare the aircraft for whatever deed is the plan, obviously to thwart that, it’s all about time,” said Shawn Pruchnicki, who teaches aviation safety and accident investigation at The Ohio State University.

Tilmon said whoever deliberately steered the plane off course likely did it with help. But what’s next is anyone’s guess, he said.

“We have been behind them all along, so now, if they had a plan, and if that plan included being able to set down someplace and refuel a little bit, we are looking at something that we may never see the end of,” he said.

The pilots

On Saturday, Malaysian police searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. Zaharie lives in an upscale, gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur.

The Ministry of Transport said Sunday that police were examining a flight simulator found at the pilot’s house.

It’s somewhat common among aviation enthusiasts to use online flight simulator programs to replicate various situations. Simulators allow users to virtually experience scenarios in various aircraft. Programs can simulate flight routes, landings and takeoffs from actual airports.

Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, 27-year-old Fariq Ab Hamid, according to a CNN crew who observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there.

Najib made clear in a news conference that in light of the latest developments, authorities have refocused their investigation to the crew, ground staff and passengers on board.

Hishammuddin, the transportation minister, told reporters the pilots didn’t request to work together.

Peter Chong, a friend of Zaharie’s, said he had been in the pilot’s house and tried the simulator.

“It’s a reflection of his love for people – because he wants to share the joy of flying with his friends,” Chong said.

He was bothered by speculation about the captain’s credibility and questions about possible ties to terrorism.

“I think it is a little bit insensitive and unfair to the family,” he said, adding he thought there was no evidence to suggest any ulterior motives on Shah’s part.

A senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that investigators are carefully reviewing the information so far collected on the pilots to determine whether there is something to indicate a plan or a motive.

“In any criminal investigation, the most important analysis is what’s the motive,” said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. “I think right now, they have to look for it, and they have to rule it out, if they can, with their own pilots, so they can start looking for motives elsewhere.”

Undoubtedly, authorities will scour through the flight manifest and look further to see whether any of the passengers on board had flight training or connections to terror groups.

According to The New York Times, one of the passengers was an aviation engineer on his way to Beijing to work for a private-jet company.

Kazakhstan to Indian Ocean

As the focus of the investigation has shifted, so, too, has the focus of the search.

Information from international and Malaysian officials indicates the jet may have flown for more than seven hours after the last contact with the pilots.

Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 a.m. March 8. The last satellite communication from the plane occurred at 8:11 a.m., Najib said, well past the scheduled arrival time in Beijing. It is possible this contact could have been made from the ground, as long as the airplane still had electrical power, Malaysia’s civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said Sunday.

That last communication, Najib said, was in one of two possible traffic corridors shown on a map released to reporters. A northern arc stretches from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and a southern arc spans from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.

“Due to the type of satellite data, we are unable to confirm the precise location of the plane when it last made contact with the satellite,” Najib said.

Because the northern parts of the traffic corridor include some tightly guarded airspace over India, Pakistan and even some U.S. installations in Afghanistan, U.S. authorities believe it more likely the aircraft crashed into waters outside of the reach of radar south of India, a U.S. official told CNN. If it had flown farther north, it’s likely it would have been detected by radar.

Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport said Sunday that both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance. Malaysian officials are working with 25 countries, many of them along the corridors. They include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Afghanistan’s Ministry of Transport said it has joined the search, but said there is no evidence the plane flew over Afghan soil.

Separately, India has “temporarily halted” its search for the missing plane while Malaysian authorities reassess the situation, according to a top military official.

“We are conserving our assets for now,” Rear Adm. Sudhir Pillai, the chief of staff of India’s joint Andaman and Nicobar command, said Sunday. “We are on a standby.”

He said the Malaysians are reviewing India’s deployment.

Families at boiling point

For the families and loved ones of those aboard Flight 370, tensions boiled over Sunday in Beijing at the daily briefing by Malaysia Airlines.

Nine days after the plane went missing, patience is running thin with officials.

Before a packed room, one man told them that the families have already lost faith.

“A liar can lie once, twice or three times, but what’s the point (to) keep lying?” he said. “What we ask for is the truth. Don’t hide things from us.”

In the face of mounting criticism over its handling of the situation, Malaysia Airlines has defended its actions, saying it took time to verify satellite signals and give authorities a chance to analyze their significance before releasing information.

But at Sunday’s Beijing briefing, a majority of the people in the room stood up when the man asked how many had lost trust in the airline and the Malaysian government.

Another man rushed the front of the room and tried to throw a punch but was stopped.

The airline has been picking up the tab for families of the Chinese passengers to stay in Beijing during the ordeal.

China is sending technical experts to join the investigation, and two Chinese search vessels headed for the Strait of Malacca, according to Xinhua.

People are across the world have shown their support for those involved.

During his weekly Sunday message following prayers at the Vatican, Pope Francis asked the crowd to pray for the crew members and passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane and their families. “We are close to them in this difficult moment,” Pope Francis said.

When the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan meet Tuesday in London, a key issue will be the whereabouts of a senior Taliban member who the Afghans believe would be valuable in future peace talks.

The Pakistanis announced last month that they had freed Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The Taliban alleges he is still in Pakistani custody under pressure from the U.S.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has suggested that Baradar, a former No. 2 in the Islamic militant movement behind leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, is important to moving forward the stalled negotiations to end the 12-year war.

Talks with the Taliban have taken on greater urgency as the clock ticks down toward December 2014 and the final withdrawal of U.S. and NATO combat troops from Afghanistan.

The mystery surrounding Baradar — a founder of the Taliban movement — will figure prominently at the London meeting between Karzai and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said Afghan presidential spokesman Aimal Faizi. British Prime Minister David Cameron is hosting the meeting aimed at improving often-hostile relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

One senior Taliban official said Baradar is still under house arrest in Pakistan and is not allowed to see his family until he agrees to meet with Afghanistan's High Peace Council, which was set up by Karzai to negotiate with the religious movement.

The Taliban official told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that Baradar had spoken twice to his family in Karachi since his release was announced Sept. 21.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because Mullah Omar has not authorized interviews, the official, who held a commanding position during the Taliban rule, also spent four years in Pakistani custody. He said Baradar met Taliban members while in custody and assured them that he would not defy Mullah Omar's orders forbidding direct talks with the Afghan government.

A U.S. official said there are suggestions that outgoing Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani is trying to arrange a meeting between Baradar and Afghan officials. The official did not have authorization to talk to reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Pakistani officials have refused to comment.

The Taliban leader who spoke to the AP said Pakistani intelligence has said Baradar will likely be released in the next month.

But two senior U.S. officials had earlier told AP that Washington asked Pakistan not to release Baradar because he would give the Taliban a strategic advantage on the battlefield. The two U.S. officials also spoke on condition of anonymity because they too were not authorized to talk to reporters.

Karzai is expected to demand that he and his High Peace Council talk to Baradar — at least by telephone — to urge him to press his Taliban comrades into talks.

Baradar has been a priority for Karzai, who claimed the Taliban leader had been ready to talk peace when he was arrested in a CIA-Pakistani operation in 2010. Baradar belongs to the same Kandahar-based tribe as Karzai, who has sought to win over the Taliban by pressing Pakistan to release its members.

Attempts to open talks between Afghanistan and the Taliban in June ended in failure after Karzai accused the militants of setting up a government in exile and demanded they remove their flag and a sign identifying the movement as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Taliban refused and closed their office in the Gulf state of Qatar.

Despite Karzai's insistence that the High Peace Council lead negotiations, one of its senior members, Mohammed Mohaqiq, complained that the president and its chief secretary, Mohammed Masoom Stanikzai, have sidelined the council. Mohaqiq said Karzai's reliance on tribal links to entice the Taliban to talks is doomed to fail because the group is ""motivated by ideology, not tribal ties.""

The Afghanistan Bravery Medal, similar to the American Presidential Unit Citation Medal, was awarded to the PHQ for marked security improvements in Zabul province.



“Since [Brig. Gen. Ghulam Sahki] took over as [provincial police chief], the police force has been receiving lots of good training and teaching,” said Col. Jilani Khan, chief of security for Zabul.



Right now, Jilani said the police force is maintaining heightened security to ensure the elections process is seamless in Zabul’s nine districts.



Receiving the bravery medal was a symbol of cooperation between various groups fighting for a common cause, said Jilani. It was not only a symbol of pride and bravery for the police force, but for all security forces within the province, including the Afghan National Army, the National Department of Security and International Security Assistance Forces.



“We are able to achieve peace and security because of the hard work and efforts of the police force in Zabul province accomplishing the goal of defeating enemies in the province,” said Sahki.



In recent years, there has been a decrease in violence throughout the province with a growing respect and trust from the citizens. Sakhi said because of the people, they are able to do a good job in securing the province.



Citizens of Zabul province have been reaching out to the police to assist them with security. One example of the growing cooperation is tips the PHQ have received that have allowed the police to reduce the number and effect of improvised explosive devices without loss to police or civilian life.



“Security is important. If we don’t have security, how can our educational system improve?” asked Gen. Gamil Jumbush, chief of Afghan Protection Police Force with the Ministry of Interior. “How can our economics improve? How can the life of the people improve? Security is the first step to bringing forth a better life for the people.”



He said he is proud of all his friends in the province who are doing an excellent job, and hopes they proudly run ahead in the offices they occupy to continue building a better life for Zabul province.

By Aynur Jafarova

The governments of Azerbaijan and Afghanistan will sign an agreement on cooperation in the energy field in the near future, Azerbaijani ambassador to Afghanistan and Pakistan Dashgin Shikarov told Trend on August 27.

The document is scheduled for signing during the visit of Afghan Mines and Petroleum Minister Wahidullah Shahrani to Azerbaijan in early September, Shikarov underscored.

Currently Azerbaijan is among the top five countries, which invest in Afghanistan and is ready to expand its investments in the country, he added.

""Five years ago an Azerbaijani investor with his Afghan partner invested $30 million in oil refining in Afghanistan. We are ready to invest about $1 to 2 billion in different sectors in Afghanistan in the near future based on the plans for private and public sector in Azerbaijan,"" Shikarov stressed.

Currently an oil refinery has been launched in Mazari-Sharif which was constructed through financing by both Afghan and Azerbaijani investors. The refining capacity of the plant is 500 tons of crude oil per day. It is planned to increase the plant's daily capacity to 1,500 tons.

According to Shikarov, large reserves of natural gas were discovered in the southern part of Afghanistan, and Azerbaijan with huge experience in oil and gas sector offered to use the experience of Azerbaijani specialists during the field development in this country.

During the visit the delegation headed by Afghan Minister of Mines and Petroleum will hold meetings in the ministries of Azerbaijan and discuss all actual issues of future cooperation.

As a result of negotiations it is planned to sign several bilateral documents on development of cooperation, he noted.

According to Shikarov, Afghanistan is also interested in Azerbaijani investment in country's energy sector and the Afghan government provides all the guarantees for the security of investments.

The trade turnover between Azerbaijan and Afghanistan amounted to $119.92 million in 2012.

The share of Afghanistan in Azerbaijan's foreign trade turnover was 0.36 percent, including 0.5 percent made up by Azerbaijan's export, in 2012. The trade turnover with Afghanistan increased by 19.66 percent compared to 2011.",Q1

The siege of a hospital in the city of Quetta has ended after security forces stormed the building, freeing 35 people trapped inside. Four attackers were killed during the siege, while another arrested, while there is no information on their identities, said Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Associated Press reports.

Khan added that four security forces and one senior government official were killed in the siege.



The first bomb in the capital of Balochistan province went off in a bus with students near a women’s university, causing 12 fatalities and injuring about 20.



“The dead were all female students,” the local police chief Zubair Mahmood told AFP.



An “improvised explosive device” was planted on the bus and exploded just as the bus was leaving the university, he added. Police are investigating if the device was remotely activated.



Another explosion rocked a corridor of the city hospital, where the dead and the injured were taken, reportedly upon arrival of local government and police officials. A top government official was killed in the blast and two other people wounded, said head of police operations, according to AP.



Around this time, parts of the hospital were besieged by militants. The armed men were stationed on rooftops and surrounded the building as intermittent gunfire was heard, said the head of police operations in Quetta, Fayaz Sumbal. Several people were taken hostage.



Frontier Corps troops and police commandos have been called in while the hospital’s security officials were trying to clear the building, Sumbal added.

No group has yet taken responsibility for the explosions. It is also not clear yet whether the two events are related.



Balochistan province borders Afghanistan, and the region has seen a surge in militant attacks in recent months. While no one has yet taken responsibility for the recent blast, violent attacks on Pakistani women have been carried out by both separatist and Islamists groups, who oppose women’s education.

The troops were killed at an outpost in volatile Logar province, about 50 miles outside Kabul, according to U.S. and Afghan officials. It remains unclear how the incident occurred, and officials said it was under investigation.

There has been no issue in Afghanistan more sensitive than NATO airstrikes, which President Hamid Karzai has long protested as inhumane and ineffective. U.S. military officials have argued that they are a critical component of counterterrorism efforts. The strikes — far less frequent than they once were — are carried out by both unmanned and manned aircraft.

“The coalition knows the location of every Afghan outpost,” said Abdul Wali, head of the Logar Provincial Council. “How can such incidents happen?”

Western officials were quick to apologize for the airstrike, which occurred before sunrise Thursday. In a statement, the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said the aircraft was performing reconnaissance for an Afghan operation when it “engaged suspected insurgents on a ridge.”

“It was later determined that the suspected insurgents were Afghan National Army soldiers,” the statement said.

“We value the strong relationship with our Afghan partners, and we will determine what actions will be taken to ensure incidents like this do not happen again,” the ISAF said.

In addition to the fatalities, seven soldiers were wounded, according to provincial spokesman Mohammad Darwish.

Afghan soldiers often request U.S. air support during intense firefights with the Taliban, and Afghan military officials credit that assistance with saving the lives of many troops. But the United States also maintains the ability to conduct strikes on its own, often targeting high-level insurgents.

This time, according to Logar-based Afghan military spokesman Mohammad Sadiq, the Afghans did not call in an airstrike.

Also Thursday, Qayum Karzai, the president's brother, announced that he would withdraw his bid for the presidency and support Zalmay Rassoul, now widely thought to be the front-runner in an election scheduled for April.

President Karzai told The Washington Post this week that he had been pressuring his brother to leave the race so as to avoid the perception that he backed Qayum Karzai's candidacy. But that pressure has given many Afghans the impression that Karzai is trying to clear the way for Rassoul, his former foreign minister.

In a news conference Thursday, Qayum Karzai did not address his brother’s role in ending his campaign. Instead, he spoke in broad terms about Rassoul’s qualifications.

“I request all respectable religious scholars, tribal elders, youths, sisters and brothers to strongly support Dr. Zalmay Rassoul,” he said.",Q1

""Both the countries are confronted with brutal terrorism and a joint strategy would be needed to cope with this situation,"" Asfandyar remarked while addressing the first well attended death anniversary of former senior minister Bashir Ahmad Bilour here at Nishtar Hall Peshawar. Central Leader of ANP Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, Interim President of Awami National Party Haji Adeel, former chief minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ameer Haider Khan Hoti, former information minister and leader of ANP Mian Iftikhar Hussain, provincial organiser Awami National Party Bashir Matta, Awami National Party FATA President Latif Afrdi and a large number of party workers were present on the occasion.

Asfandyar said that they are not only against drone attacks but are also against the militants' infiltration into the border area and their sanctuaries in Fata. He said, ""It is unfathomable that on one hand Imran Khan is condemning violation of our aerial limits while on the other hand he is silent about the ground violation of our territory,"" adding that both things are unacceptable for ANP.

He said that when US drone attacked Damadola area of Bajaur Agency, Awami National Party leadership staged protest rally in Bajaur and from the very beginning they were against these attacks.

Regarding division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and creating of Hazara Province, ANP chief said that Awami National Party will never accept division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and said that how one can justify the demand of a single Sariki district which is only Abbotabad and some part of Haripur.

He maintained that they are trying to unite Pakhtun in the shape of Hazarwal and Pakhtuns. He also criticised the statement of certain federal ministers for discussing controversial project of Kalabagh dam, saying that two province including Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are against this project and it will not be allowed at any cost.

He paid glowing tributes to martyred leader of Awami National Party Bashir Ahmad Bilour and termed him valiant commander of non-violent philosopher Bacha Khan and Rehbar Tehreek Khan Abdul Wali Khan. He said that the death of Bashir Ahmad Bilour has created a major vacuum in the party and it is impossible for them to fill this vacuum.

Addressing on the occasion MNA Ghulam Ahmad Bilour appealed to Taliban to shun violence and stop killing of Pakhtun. He said that one day is fixed for the death and he does not fear about his life but he was fearful about those Pakhtun who are killing other Pakhtun brothers.

He said that few days earlier of Bashir Ahmad Bilour's death, Bashir advised his wife not to see his face if he was injured on the back and see his face if he was targeted on his chest. He said that Bashir was a leader who was not killed for his own cause but for the cause of his country and for the cause of his nation.

Though he was attacked several times but he did not succumb to the pressure of militants. He recalled Taliban leadership that if even they killed all Pakhtuns, no one in this life and in the life after this would gave them commendation and awards. He said that they are the soldier of non-violent philosopher Khan Abdul Ghafar Khan and would not quit his philosophy.",Q1

It is not the existence and power of systems like Prism and the links from NSA and GCHQ to the internet companies that is the problem: that capability is what it takes to do the job society has asked them to do in an internet age.

The real debate we should be having on the back of the Snowden case is about what privacy in a cyber-connected world can realistically mean given the volumes of personal data we hand over to the private sector in return for our everyday convenience, and the continued need for warranted access for security and law enforcement.

Whatever view we take on where as a society we want the balance between our right to privacy against our right to live in security, we all need to have confidence that in the hands of our authorities these powerful tools of interception are not being abused.

We have to have trust in those we ask to verify the activities of the state on our behalf: in particular we need to have confidence the senior judges and parliamentarians (the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, or ISC) can enter deep inside the ring of secrecy around police and intelligence work to satisfy themselves that all is well, and have the clout to get things put right if not. The senior judges who check on the lawfulness of intelligence work already exercise that legal power.

The ISC has recently been given enhanced powers to do its oversight job, including ensuring there is the right ethical culture throughout the intelligence community. The ISC now has to show it can understand the issues advanced intercept technology poses and must be given the expert help to do that. My feeling is that staff in the intelligence agencies would welcome deeper but more informed oversight, not least to protect their reputation.

Verification by so-called whistleblowers is certainly not the answer, as the Snowden case is dramatically revealing. When David Miranda, the partner of the Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald – who has led on the Snowden story – was stopped by the police at Heathrow airport he was found to have on his hard drive 58,000 top secret British intelligence documents that had been shared with the NSA and stolen by Snowden (along with no doubt hundreds of thousands of comparable American intelligence documents). The British material covers in detail all aspects of the intelligence work we conduct alongside the US from detecting cyber-attacks to uncovering terrorist plots, to supporting our forces in Afghanistan.

And this material, British and American (and of other co-operating states), might now to be in the hands of the intelligence services of Russia and China. Not even the KGB in its 1950s heyday could have dreamed of being in a position to do so much damage to western intelligence. It will be like watching a slow motion car crash as lines of intelligence dry up, intelligence officers are exposed and cyber-attackers learn to avoid our defences. The Guardian sensibly agreed to have their copies in London destroyed under supervision so that other aggressive intelligence services would not be tempted to come after the stash, and the newspaper at least been selective in what it has published.

Even so, some damage to our security could still inadvertently have been done, since journalists are not best placed to know exactly what detail may complete the jigsaw puzzles of our adversaries. Instead of more revelations the Guardian should focus on a principled debate on how to allow intelligence agencies and law enforcement to do their job in keeping us from harm whilst preventing unjustified snooping by public or commercial sectors.

Why are there U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan?



Unless one attempts to answer that question honestly, there's no proper way to ponder when and how to bring our troops back home.



While some would suggest that we've got to keep troops there until the Afghan government is stable enough for our military forces to quit their mission entirely, that, in the end, is little more than an excuse for permanence. Instead, it makes sense to set benchmarks, to have goals, and to set about leaving when those have been attained.



This is where President Barack Obama has found himself of late, as the White House has been seriously considering plans to bring the whole contingent of U.S. military personnel home within a year.



Details of the proposal remain subject to revision, but the mere fact that the commander in chief has openly been discussing the so-called zero option is reason to have hope.



Our nation cannot have troops in every land across the globe indefinitely. We went into Afghanistan with a clear mission: removing the Taliban from power. It was the repressive Taliban, of course, that had provided safe harbor to Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida associates before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The Taliban was dispatched fairly quickly. And while it took years to find and kill bin Laden, that mission, too, was finally accomplished.



Which leads back to the fundamental question: Why are there U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan? There's no clear good reason, actually.



Which leaves one then to ask: How should we get out? How soon? Thankfully, the White House has been asking just that.



Obama, it must be remembered, supported this war. But that doesn't mean he should want it to last forever.",Q1

Washington CNN —

When Congress is tasked with debating U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, a common refrain from lawmakers is to follow the advice of military commanders. It has been repeated dozens of times, for instance, by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, when discussing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“We urge the administration to work urgently with Iraqi authorities to reach an agreement that reflects the best military advice of U.S. commanders on the ground,” he wrote in a news release in 2011 about reducing the U.S. military footprint in Iraq. He said something similar in a 2012 statement about Afghanistan.

Now that Congress will have its say on U.S. intervention in Syria, it has testimony and documents from top members of the military to reference, and some of the testimony falls short of an enthusiastic endorsement of U.S. involvement.

Concerns exist within the ranks of the military over the outcome of such strikes, and those concerns are coupled with worries about strains on an already stretched military.

Dempsey: Intervention in Syria could cost billions

A frank assessment of the risks

In a series of communications with Congress over the summer, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified and wrote letters to Congress about the risk of U.S. military involvement in Syria. Chief among them is the challenge that a limited strike remain limited in scope.

In an assessment to Sen. Carl Levin, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on July 19, Dempsey outlined possible scenarios and the risks they bring. Dempsey said U.S. involvement, even if it’s limited in nature, would probably lead to an extended stay.

“Once we take action, we should be prepared for what comes next. Deeper involvement is hard to avoid,” he wrote.

Dempsey explains that risks include retaliatory attacks by the al-Assad regime, civilian casualties and “extremists” – including al Qaeda, Hezbollah and Iran – gaining more control and access to weapons, including chemical weapons.

Two days before the alleged chemical attacks in Syria, Dempsey replied to a request from New York Rep. Eliot Engel on Dempsey’s assessment of different military options in Syria. The general outlined a difficult path for U.S. success in Syria.

“In a variety of ways, the use of U.S. military force can change the military balance, but it cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict,” Dempsey wrote. “It is my belief that the side we chose must be ready to support their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.”

Another high-ranking member of the military urged extreme caution. According to the Washington Post, Gen. James Mattis, former head of U.S. Central Command, said at a security conference in July that “this is going to be a full-throated, very, very serious war” if the U.S. becomes involved.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon said he has concerns about the ongoing strategy after an attack.

“I’m concerned about more the military aspects, what are we expecting Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, their other allies in the region to do. What are we doing about any attacks that might happen to Israel or Jordan or Turkey, other areas in the region,” said McKeon, R-California. “For that matter, our embassies around the world. Are we doing everything we can to make sure we’re able to protect ourselves should they do any kind of counterattack?”

Overstretched military

Any U.S. involvement will not be cheap. The U.S. is coming off a decade-long war in Iraq and is still fighting a 12-year-long war in Afghanistan. Additionally, tight budgets caused by forced spending cuts are concerning to those both inside and outside the military.

The most likely scenario in Syria would be cruise missile strikes followed by a bomb damage assessment, with additional strikes on what was missed or not destroyed. Additionally, if the U.S. goes after chemical weapons capabilities, airstrikes would necessitate taking out Syria’s air defense and command and control capabilities.

Dempsey wrote in his July letter that using “lethal force to prevent the use or proliferation of chemical weapons” could cost “well over $1 billion per month.” He also wrote that controlling chemical weapons would require more resources than just air and cruise missile strikes. He said it would need to be coupled with “thousands of special operations forces and other ground forces” to secure critical sites. President Obama, however, has said he would put “no boots” on the ground in Syria.

The $1 billion price tag could take a hefty bite out of a slimmed-down military budget. Members of the military have testified before Congress and released statements about the crippling effect that the forced spending cuts has had on the military. Military operations will be “significantly and adversely affected,” an August 10 Defense Department news release said.

The military requested and the president proposed a budget of $526.6 billion for 2014, which is 8% more than what the Defense Department is currently operating with. Defense Department Comptroller Robert F. Hale told Congress that that request “supports national security interests in a time of very complex challenges.”

But it’s unclear whether the military would get its wish. Congress has not overturned the forced spending cuts, which would slash $52 billion next year. As the military points out, the sequester’s impact in 2014 would be 40% greater than 2013.

Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, said the U.S. simply can’t afford to get involved in Syria.

“We’re in a position right now where we don’t have the assets to get involved in another intervention,” he said on CNN’s “The Lead” last week.

McKeon had similar concerns about the forced spending cuts.

“That is the thing that really concerns me is, sequestration on the backs of our military is making it very difficult for them to carry out mission after mission,” McKeon said.

Congressional hawks tie Syria to budget cuts

In addition to budget cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have strained the military but also taught military leaders valuable lessons. Dempsey wrote: “We have learned from the past 10 years; however, that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state. … Should the regime’s institutions collapse in the absence of a viable opposition, we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control.”

Rep. John Garamendi, D-California, echoed Dempsey’s sentiment. “The past decade has amply demonstrated the folly of military commitments poorly conceived,” he wrote in a statement.

Secretary of State John Kerry dismissed that argument. “Fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility,” he said Friday.

Despite concerns, support exists

However, some former top military leaders are coming out in support of a military strike. Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme commander of NATO who led military forces in the Kosovo war in 1999, laid out a grim assessment.

“At a time when the U.S. faces many other security threats, not to mention economic and political challenges at home, it is tempting to view action against Syria’s regime as a significant distraction. Certainly, it also carries risks. … You can’t always control the script after you decide to launch a limited, measured attack,” he wrote in an opinion piece Friday in USA Today.

Despite his measured tone, he said the humanitarian crisis is the U.S.’s responsibility.

“President Obama has rightly drawn a line at the use of chemical weapons. Some weapons are simply too inhuman to be used. And, as many of us learned during 1990s, in the words of President Clinton, ‘Where we can make a difference, we must act.’ “

Dempsey has not made any public statements about U.S. intervention. He’s scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",Q1

New York, March 21, 2014–The Committee to Protect Journalists is deeply saddened by an attack on Thursday night in Afghanistan in which Sardar Ahmad, a senior reporter for Agence France-Presse’s Kabul bureau, was killed. Four gunmen stormed the Serena Hotel in Kabul during Nowruz celebrations, which marks the start of the Afghan and Persian new year. The assailants killed nine, including Ahmad, members of his family including his wife and two children; a former Paraguayan diplomat visiting the country to observe elections; and foreign nationals from Canada, India, New Zealand, and Pakistan, according to news reports. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, the reports said.

“We mourn the death of Sardar Ahmad and extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues,” said Robert Mahoney, CPJ’s deputy director. “His death is a tremendous loss for Afghanistan’s press, which works in an atmosphere of tremendous instability, especially as elections draw closer.”

There has been an uptick in attacks in Kabul in recent weeks as next month’s presidential elections approach. Earlier this month, British-Swedish journalist Nils Horner was shot dead in broad daylight in Kabul’s diplomatic district, and in January, a Lebanese restaurant popular with foreigners was attacked in a suicide bombing.",Q1

http://www.dawn.com/news/1060794/nadra-chief-accused-of-insubordination,Nadra chief accused of insubordination,"ISLAMABAD, Dec 5: The National Assembly made a hot start to its winter session on Thursday, with opposition parties taking the government on frontally over its sacking of the Nadra chief. They said the dismissal had strengthened their suspicions about rigging in the May 11 election.

This provoked a strong charge-sheet against the official from Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan even though the issue was before two top courts.

Monday’s dismissal of Tariq Malik, Chairman of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) tasked to verify disputed votes in several National Assembly and provincial assembly constituencies in Punjab and Sindh — and its suspension by the Islamabad High Court — dominated the opening day of the session.

There was little restraint from either side even after the house learnt that the government had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court earlier in the day, seeking reversal of the high court’s order.

Opposition leader Khursheed Ahmed Shah of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan and vice-chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and Jamaat-i-Islami’s parliamentary leader Sahibzada Tariqullah all saw ulterior motives behind the government’s move. They cited the reported midnight delivery of the sacking order to the official at a time when Nadra was in the process of verifying voters’ thumb impressions in a National Assembly constituency of Lahore.

The PPP and PTI leaders smelt a rat, particularly in the timing of the government action, which they said had strengthened the doubts or reservations they had initially expressed about the fairness of the general election, although both parties had accepted the overall result.

But Chaudhry Nisar appeared well prepared for the onslaught and was encouraged by repeated desk-thumping from government benches as he broke out of an initial hesitation to speak on a sub judice matter.

He unleashed charge after charge against the Nadra chief, ranging from irregularities in his appointment to the highly paid post last year for a three-year contract until Augusts 2015 by the previous government, administrative insubordination and what he called “constant leaks” to the media without permission about the voter verification process.

And at one stage, the minister, who also had complaints about the media’s perceived failure to differentiate between truth and untruth, said: “How Nadra chairman is responsible about (the verification of) thumb impressions? The (interior) ministry is responsible.”

On being reminded by the opposition leader of the minister’s offer in a previous house session to let voter verification be done in 40 constituencies, instead of just the PTI-identified four in Lahore, Chaudhry Nisar said he could not do it at his discretion as it was the Election Commission’s domain. He said he would not mind “if it were done in four constituencies, 40 constituencies or (all the directly elected) 272 constituencies” of the National Assembly.

And he could tell the result of such an exercise in advance, saying “60,000 to 70,000 votes will not be verified” in a constituency – citing cases of such large numbers of votes remaining unverified in a couple of Karachi constituencies – because the comparatively more efficient synthetic ink had not been used for taking thumb impressions.

Mr Shah and Mr Qureshi had a second go each at the minister’s tirade, with the opposition leader recalling his party’s description of the polls as “ROs’ (returning officers’) election” and saying that although he was not directly blaming the PML-N, “there is someone who did the rigging”.

Mr Qureshi wondered what would now happen to his party’s challenges before election tribunals to the results of 65 constituencies and a writ petition about the verification of votes in four constituencies of Lahore.

Railways Minister Saad Rafiq took pains to paint the PTI’s outbursts about alleged election fraud as “immaturity” and was confronted by a PTI member from Karachi, Arif Alvi, calling the action against Nadra chief a “drone attack” against elections.

Strangely, neither side talked about the continuing PTI sit-ins in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against Nato supplies to and from Afghanistan in protest against US drone attacks in the tribal areas and of a demonstration held by the party outside the Parliament House before the start of the session.",Q1
http://www.geo.tv/article-133489-Gates-blast-rocks-Obama-administration,Gates blast rocks Obama administration,"WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama's ""team of rivals"" first-term cabinet has come back to haunt him, following surprisingly blunt critiques of his leadership and top aides by ex-Pentagon boss Robert Gates.Gates, the Washington Republican lifer who served six presidents in senior national security jobs, sent political shockwaves through Washington after his unsparing assessments of the Obama administration in his new book, leaked to top newspapers.Tell-all memoirs by former administration officials looking to gild their retirement nest eggs and bolster their own legacies are nothing new -- and uniformly infuriate presidents and top subordinates whichever party runs the White House.But the Gates bombshell was so remarkable because of the pedigree of the former defense secretary and CIA chief, his long experience as a confidant of presidents, and his reputation for unruffled integrity and discretion.So it is more difficult for the White House to write off the book -- ""Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary of War"" -- due to be published on January 14, as a typical episode of Washington score settling.It may be that privately, despite taking the high ground in public, White House officials are second-guessing the president's decision to ask Gates, a Republican holdover from the George W. Bush administration, to stay on as defense secretary in his first cabinet.Given the deep respect Obama appears to have for Gates, and a belief that they were on the same page strategically on many issues, the revelations may be personally hurtful to the president.In the most damaging revelations, Gates suggests Obama soured on his own troop surge strategy in Afghanistan and lost confidence in General David Petraeus and other military brass he picked to lead it.Gates also slams White House aides for obsessive attempts to control all US national security and foreign policy to the detriment of the State Department and the Pentagon, and excerpts from his book reek of a deep distaste for Washington and its political games.In comments which could reverberate in the 2016 presidential campaign, he says Hillary Clinton told Obama that she only opposed a troop surge strategy in Iraq for political reasons during the heat of their primary battle.He also blasted Vice President Joe Biden as ""wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue"" of the last four decades.The political gang that Gates so disdained was out in the president's defense on Wednesday.""He always indicated he had a good working relationship with the president,"" David Axelrod, a former top Obama aide who remains close to the president, told NBC.Axelrod also argued that the Afghan war strategy -- for which Gates was partly responsible -- was ""a mess"" when Obama took office in 2009.Former White House chief of staff Bill Daley said on CBS that Gates's memoir was ""rather unfortunate,"" adding that it was a ""disservice"" to publish such a book while the administration was still fighting the Afghan war.Many of Gates's critiques are not new in themselves -- and have been floating around the Obama White House for years.But Gates' stature gives them extra currency and they are likely to linger in the political discourse in Washington for years, and in the histories that will shape Obama's legacy after he leaves office.While Gates said plenty of positive things about Obama -- calling him a man of ""integrity"" and praising him for gutsy decision to order a raid to kill Osama bin Laden -- and Clinton -- who he sees as smart, and a great ambassador for America abroad -- it is the criticisms that will likely be remembered.His narrative also appears to reflect typical fighting over turf between the White House and Pentagon -- as Obama aides sought to wrestle back what they saw as executive authority appropriated by the military during the Bush administration.The furor over Gates will be an unwelcome distraction for the White House as it sets about trying to rebuild Obama's personal brand after a brutal year.It will also offer ammunition against Obama's foreign policy record, once seen as an area of strength that has come under fire as a sectarian war rages across the Middle East and Iraq descends into civil war two years after he pulled the last US soldiers from the country.The White House offered a detailed rebuttal to the Gates excerpts Tuesday, but took the moral high ground, wishing him well after an accident that has left him in a neck collar.National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Obama views Biden as one of the ""leading statesmen"" of his time and said the president was firmly committed to the Afghan strategy.

http://www.globalresearch.ca/westgate-mall-attack-death-toll-continues-to-rise-as-fbi-deploys-agents-to-nairobi/5351724,Nairobi Westgate Mall Attack Death Toll Continues to Rise as FBI Deploys Agents to Kenya - Global Research,"The death toll from last Saturday’s attack on Nairobi’s Westgate mall by members of Somalia’s Al Shabab militia has risen to at least 72, with dozens more reported missing. The attack was launched by a unit of 10 to 15 Al Shabab fighters who took more than 100 hostages, executing dozens during an extended siege lasting into this week.

Al Shabab said it targeted the mall in retaliation for the ongoing, US-backed Kenyan intervention in Somalia. Westgate is a luxury mall, frequented by members of the Kenyan ruling elite as well as wealthy individuals from around the world, and which is partially Israeli-owned.

Authorities in Nairobi said they are bracing for scores of new casualties once rubble is cleared from a large portion of the mall, which collapsed during the assault. The cause of the collapse remains unclear.

Inside Nairobi’s Somali community, which fears ethnic retribution for the attack, there are rising accusations that Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government is engaged in a cover-up. One resident of Nairobi’s Little Mogadishu told the Guardian: “This is a cover-up motivated by politics. I don’t trust the authorities—I think they exploded everything in Westgate to destroy the evidence.”

A growing body of evidence suggests that the attack was part of a broader series of operations in Kenya and the region by Al Shabab or other Al Qaeda-linked forces internationally. It was apparently meticulously planned.

There was a remarkable level of preparation and prior internal penetration of the Westgate mall by the Al Shabab fighters before the attack. Kenyan officials have reported that heavy machine guns were smuggled into the mall in the week before the attack, with the collaboration of at least one employee. Reports have even surfaced that the attackers were renting a store at the mall as part of the plot.

Kenya has also been hit by two other deadly attacks, on Wednesday and yesterday, on police camps along the Kenya-Somalia border, killing three police officers.

Kenyan authorities also sought an Interpol international arrest warrant against a British citizen, Samantha Lewthwaite—the so-called “White Widow” of one of the suicide bombers who attacked London on July 7, 2005. There have been repeated reports that she may have been one of the attackers.

She was reportedly living in South Africa prior to the attack, working as an IT specialist under the name Natalie Faye Webb. Kenyan officials claimed she escaped south into Tanzania after the latest attack.

It is unclear how she could have escaped, or how such personnel could have so thoroughly penetrated a prominent target such as the Westgate mall in advance of the attack.

US officials are warning that similar attacks may be in preparation against targets in the US. “You never know when a terrorist attack in a faraway place could be a harbinger of something that could strike at the United States,” former Obama administration official Daniel Benjamin told the New York Times.

According to a Times report released Thursday evening, “US Sees Direct Threat in Attack at Kenya Mall,” the FBI has deployed “dozens” of agents to Nairobi to investigate the scene.

While the US is pushing Kenya to attack Al Shabab and continue its occupation of Somalia, Al Qaeda-linked forces on the African continent have broadly received a major boost from the US and its allies since the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime in 2011. NATO’s ground troops against Gaddafi during the Libyan war were largely drawn from Islamist militias, or groups like the Libya Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).

The large shipments of arms and cash provided by the US and its allies to Al Qaeda-linked opposition militias in Syria and Libya appear to be improving Al Qaeda’s operational capacity across the Middle East and Africa.

The possibility cannot be discounted that the Nairobi attack was blowback in response to the postponement of a US war against Syria in support of Al Qaeda forces fighting the Syrian regime.

While Al Shabab surfaced in 2006 as a Somali Islamist militia emerging from the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), its leadership is increasingly drawn from foreign fighters alleged to have experience in Al Qaeda circles. The top security and training chief for Al Shabab is a Pakistani man (Abu Musa Mombasa), the top financier is Saudi (Sheik Mohammed Abu Faid), and the chief recruiter is Sudanese (Mahmoud Mujajir).

The rank and file of Al Shabab, on the other hand, is composed of youth from Somalia, Kenya, and other East African countries, with media reports placing the militia’s numbers between 5,000 and 15,000. A smaller contingent of fighters recruited from the United States and Europe is also present in the ranks. Youth recruited into the ranks of Al Shabab are drawn from areas where social conditions are ruinous and economic opportunities nonexistent. Many are forcibly conscripted.

Al Shabab is being increasingly integrated into the financial and logistical circuits which sustain other Al Qaeda affiliates throughout North Africa and the Middle East.

In an analysis from 2010, titled “Al Qaeda Veterans Now Run Al Shabaab Militia,” Murithi Mutiga wrote, “Foreign jihadists have overrun the Somali nationals previously in charge of Al Shabaab, a development blamed for the movement’s new posture as an exporter of terrorism and a threat to stability in East Africa and beyond. The Islamists, mostly veterans of the Al Qaeda training camps of Afghanistan, now control the movement’s policy making organs and were directly responsible for ordering the Kampala bombings which announced the Al Shabaab’s arrival as an actor with a reach that extends beyond Somali territory.”

The Westgate operation represents a significant blow to US imperialism’s strategy in the region. The US has repeatedly encouraged invasions of Somalia by Ethiopian and Kenyan forces, backing major incursions in 2006 and 2011, and has devoted massive military resources to securing American domination over the strategically crucial Horn of Africa.

These wars are cited by Al Shabab as the source of its grievances against the Kenyan government and its American patrons.

Responding to the attack in a statement Tuesday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said that he will continue waging the “war on terror” in Somalia, saying that Kenyan security forces “ashamed and defeated our attackers.”

The Westgate attack is also a blow to the Kenyan regime, however, which presides over an economy heavily based on tourism. Kenyan government statistics show that tens of thousands of US citizens travel to Kenya every year for tourism.",Q1

On the other hand, the company had increased the quantum of work given to its workers in Kerala and had given them new contracts, Mr. Raffi said. Here, however, it has set up a taskforce to check the quality of the beedis. “There is a conspiracy against the beedi industry of this district,” he said.

He was serving as a combat engineer at the time of his death, the Marine Corps said in a separate statement. He enlisted in the service Aug. 20, 2012, officials said.

The Marines said Rodriguez has been awarded the National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the NATO Medal-International Security Assistance Force Afghanistan.

""The Marines and sailors of First Marine Division mourn the loss of Lance Corporal Rodriguez,'' the Marines Corps said. ""Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family.''

In Fairhaven Thursday night, the town's Board of Selectmen observed a moment of silence to honor Rodriguez.

Chairman Charles K. Murphy Sr. said he was deeply saddened to learn of Rodriguez's death.

""Our hearts just dropped,"" said Murphy, whose daughter was a friend of Rodriguez's. ""It's a great, great loss for our town.""

Murphy extended condolences to Rodriguez's family.

""If there's anything that the town of Fairhaven can do [for them], we'd be happy to do it,"" Murphy said.

Rodriguez graduated from Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School and was engaged to be married. His fiancee's family declined to comment Thursday night.

Murphy also commended Rodriguez for his service.

""He served his country, and at 19 he was probably more mature than people in their 60s and 70s because of his dedication to our community and his country,"" Murphy said.

He added that his daughter and other friends of Rodriguez's are grieving. ""She just said he was a really great guy,"" Murphy said. ""She loved hanging out with him. . . . She's very heartbroken, as well as many of her peers are tonight.""

Murphy said the police chief indicated Thursday that a police escort would be available to travel with Rodriguez's body when it returns home. The same was done for Marine Lance Corporal Patrick J. Gallagher, a former resident killed in Iraq in 2006, Murphy said.

Other selectmen offered condolences after the moment of silence. Selectman Robert J. Espindola said Rodriguez was a ""fine young man.""

""It's just a terrible shame,"" he said. ""He paid the ultimate sacrifice.""

The 2017 champions warmed up for the tournament in unconvincing fashion, suffering back-to-back defeats to Jamaica and Venezuela. But Gregg Berhalter’s side were always in control of their Group D encounter against minnows Guyana, who are 177th in the FIFA rankings, 147 places below the 30th ranked USA. D.C. United midfielder Paul Arriola opened the scoring on 28 minutes, finishing crisply into the corner after a neat pass from Bundesliga-based midfielder Weston McKennie. New Zealand-born forward Tyler Boyd doubled the US tally in the 51st minute, controlling a superb pass from midfield talisman Michael Bradley before rifling home from just inside the penalty area. Gyasi Zardes then made it 3-0 four minutes later with a bizarre goal, the ball cannoning off his head into the net after Arriola’s fierce long-range effort deflected off a defender. Boyd, who was born and raised in New Zealand but qualifies for the USA by virtue of his American mother, then added his second on 81 minutes with a crisp finish from the edge of the area. In the day’s other game, 2018 World Cup qualifiers Panama were deserved 2-0 winners over Trinidad and Tobago.

The attack comes a week after a suicide car bomb targeting a foreign military convoy killed 15 people including five Americans in the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital for nearly a year.

The Taliban announced their annual ""spring offensive"" on April 27, opening a crucial period as local security forces take the lead in the fight against the insurgents.

At least two blasts hit the centre of Kabul at about 4:00 pm (1130 GMT) on Friday, the second day of the Afghan weekend, and gunfire erupted as security forces rushed to the scene.

Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai told AFP the initial blast came close to a hospital run by the NDS intelligence agency and the headquarters of the Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF), a government force that provides security for clients including international firms, supply convoys and aid groups.

He said gunmen had occupied a building in the attack, which is ongoing.

Jawed Kazem, a local shopkeeper, said: ""I was sitting in my shop when the explosion happened. It was a big explosion which threw me off my chair, minutes later another explosion happened.

""Smoke is rising and gunfire is continuing.""

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told AFP that his group was responsible and added that the attack began with a suicide car bombing.

""A group of other mujahideen armed with heavy and light weapons then took position in a building and are firing on several targets including a building in which the foreigners and members of spy agency stay,"" he said.

The suicide bombing last Thursday was the first major attack in Kabul since March 9 when a bomber on a bicycle killed nine people outside the defence ministry during a visit by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

The attacks further underline the capital's vulnerability to militant assaults as 100,000 NATO troops gradually withdraw from Afghanistan ahead of the end of international combat operations next year.

Local forces are increasingly coming under attack from the Taliban as they take over from foreign forces, who will pull out of Afghanistan by the end of next year.

Six members of the APPF were killed on Tuesday in a roadside bombing in western Afghanistan as they travelled to a hydroelectric dam that is under protection from insurgent attack.

More than 11 years after the Taliban regime was ousted in 2001, efforts to seek a political settlement ending the violence have so far made little progress, but pressure is growing ahead of the NATO withdrawal.

http://southampton.patch.com/groups/politics-and-elections/p/bishop-puts-forth-bill-to-aid-veterans-exposed-to-toxic-burn-pits,Bishop Puts Forth Bill to Aid Veterans Exposed to Toxic Burn Pits,"At a Washington, D.C., press conference Thursday, U.S. Rep. Tim Bishop, D-Southampton, announced bipartisan legislation to study the health effects of toxic burn pit exposure and establish three centers to advance the medical science — possibly one at Stony Brook University Hospital.



According to Bishop, thousands of veterans have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with myriad health problem that could be a result of being exposed to toxic fumes from burn pits used to dispose of tires, munitions, medical waste and other materials. The proposed bill, The Helping Veterans Exposed to Toxic Chemicals Act, seeks to ensure they receive medical treatment.



Bishop previously helped pass legislation to curtail the use of burn pits, and now proposes that three centers of excellence be chosen through a competitive process to work on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of health conditions that have arisen from exposure.





""It is important that we create these because, very candidly, neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of Veteran Affairs has yet recognized the long-term health implications of exposure to the toxins associated with these burn pits,"" Bishop said.



Dr. Anthony Szema, of Stony Brook Medicine, joined Bishop in announcing the bill.



""I'm very excited about this legislation,"" Dr. Szema said. ""I hope we can become one of these centers. And I think this is a great step forward scientifically and medically for our troops.""



Suzanne Charleston of Burn Pits 360, who lost her brother in May 2012 to pancreatic cancer, said, ""The ones we've lost, we can't do anything about, but we can do things to help the men and women, the service members, that are still here.""



Peter Sullivan of the Sergeant Sullivan Center — a veterans non-for-profit in D.C. named for his late son, Sgt. Thomas Joseph Sullivan, who died from health complications following a tour in Iraq — likened today's situation to Gulf War Syndrome.



""We can't go through another episode like we did with the Persian Gulf War where still 250,000 people had illnesses that were never medically explained and to this day there is still not a clear understanding of the cause, much less effective treatment or cure,"" Sullivan said.



""The burn pit issue has been around for some time, and each time Congress has tried to address it, it certainly has been a difficult task,"" said Nick McCormick of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ""Obviously the burn pit registry was a great victory for veterans and service members the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, and the bipartisan bill seeks to build upon that and tackle the issue on a much wider and proactive scale.""



Co-sponsoring the legislation are Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Co., Rep. Walter Jobes, R-N.C., and Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.



Bishop said he hopes to broaden the bipartisan coalition then bring the bill to House leadership to advance it.

http://www.voanews.com/content/pakistan-criticizes-us-killing-of-pakistani-taliban-leader/1782146.html,Pakistan Criticizes US Killing of Pakistani Taliban Leader,"Pakistan has denounced the killing of Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a U.S. drone strike, saying it jeopardizes pending peace talks with the militant group.



Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said Saturday the drone strike has undercut government efforts to negotiate a peaceful end to the decade-long Taliban insurgency.



Khan said a government delegation was on its way to speak with Mehsud Friday when drone missiles struck his compound in North Waziristan.



Pakistani and U.S. officials have confirmed Mehsud was killed in the attack.



Pakistani Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said Saturday he hoped Mehsud's death would not stop peace efforts.



In a statement Saturday, the Afghan government condemned the killing of Mehsud and urged Pakistan to stop U.S. drone strikes, which are aimed at suspected al-Qaida and Taliban operatives.







It is unclear if the Pakistani Taliban has chosen a new leader. Some reports say the group's second in command, Khan Said, also known as Sajna, was promoted on Saturday. Others quote Taliban spokesmen saying a new leader will be chosen within a few days.



The 34-year-old Mehsud took over the Pakistani Taliban in 2009 when its previous head was killed, also by a drone strike.



The U.S. had a $5 million bounty on Mehsud. He was accused of involvement in a deadly suicide attack on a CIA compound in Afghanistan in 2009 and a failed bombing of New York's Times Square in 2010.



Mehsud's cousin, uncle and a bodyguard were also reportedly killed in the CIA attack on the compound, which sources confirmed to VOA was used by the Taliban leader.



Pakistani leaders say they strongly oppose U.S. drone strikes. But some critics believe the operations are part of a secret agreement under which Pakistan tacitly approves the U.S. strikes.",Q1
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/hagel-threaten-complete-withdrawal-afghanistan-050000386.html,Hagel Threatens Complete Withdrawal from Afghanistan,"Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel upped the anti with Afghan President Hamid Karzai Sunday morning, threatening to pull all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan if a security deal is not agreed to soon.

Karzai was expected to sign a long-term security deal that would keep U.S. troops and U.S. money in Afghanistan for the next decade after a group of tribal elders approved it last month. But he went back on his pledge with analysts speculating that he’s attempting to delay signing agreement until the Afghan presidential election in April.

Last week, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said that the so-called zero option - pulling all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014 - was on the table if Karzai refused to deal. Speaking on CBS's Face the Nation, Hagel reiterated that threat.

""If we don't have a bilateral security agreement, which I've noted, that means we can't protect our forces that would be here after 2014, no international partners will come, Afghanistan essentially will be alone. But we have no other options,"" Hagel said. ""Unless we have the security of an agreement to protect our forces…then we'll have no choice. We will not be able to stay.""

Hagel made these comments while visiting Afghanistan. He expected to meet with Karzai, but the Afghan president unexpectedly left to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

Hagel is the highest-ranking official in the Obama administration to make the threat. Experts said that Karzai is prolonging negotiations to win more concessions from the Americans. Hagel’s threat sends a clear message at a time when taxpayers and politicians are increasingly war-weary and impatient with Karzai’s posturing.

“I hope he'll come to the right decision on this. Because we need that bilateral security agreement signed for our own planning, for our own purposes, as well as our international partners,” Hagel said. He then asked, ""We should ask that question. Is it worth it or not worth it [to stay in Afghanistan]? It needs to be asked, especially in a representative government, a democracy - those questions must be asked. So it is now up to President Karzai to make a decision.”

Betina Young, 44, was convicted of providing over 95 false IDs to illegal immigrants

As part of her sentence, she must spend at least three days in jail every Christmas during her five-year probation

You've got time: Judge Michael J. Holbrook of Franklin County, Ohio created 'Holbrook holidays' where parolees spend three to five days in jail during Thanksgiving or Christmas to deter recidivism

An Ohio woman who ran a black market business providing illegal immigrants with IDs was sentenced to five years of parole yesterday - with the added condition that she spend at least three days in jail every Christmas .



The sentence was handed down to 44-year-old Betina Young by Judge Michael Holbrook who has been giving out these unique holiday sentences - called 'Holbrook holidays' - since he was elected to his position in 2004.



Judge Holbrook's bailiff David Petikas told MailOnline that 'Holbrook holidays' give parolees an idea of what real prison time would be like, and who really suffers if they continue their life of crime.



'It's a reminder of who they are letting down and the toll it may take on your family during the holidays,' Petikas said.



However, Petikas also said that parolees are offered the opportunity to work hard to complete the conditions of their parole and can be off probation in as little as a year and a half.



Young pled guilty in May on five counts of tampering with records.



In addition to probation and Holbrook Holidays, Young will have to pay a $3,000 fine.



If she skips out on any of her holidays in jail, she will have to spend 15 years in prison.

A former employee of the deputy registrar's office in Gahanna, Young would secretly set up payment plans with illegal immigrants to falsifying their records.

Young worked with 42-year-old Sekou Kpoto, who would solicit the bribes from the foreign nationals and transport them to the Gahanna agency where Young worked.



In seven years, Young issued 95 fraudulent licenses according to the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles.



An investigation by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security found that Kpoto received $700 to $1500 for each false ID, and split a portion with Young.

The attack kicked off just as journalists were gathering for security checks ahead of a presidential news conference. They reported seeing attackers exchange fire with guards at the presidential and intelligence agency headquarters.

The president himself never appeared to be in danger, locked away behind several more walls inside the heavily fortified palace itself. One source who was inside the complex, which has outer walls several dozen metres thick in places, said the fighting never approached the inner area.

""We can hear the attack but it seems to be a little distance away,"" said the source, who asked not to be named as his job does not allow him to speak to the media.

The attack took place on Thursday night local time, when four men with pistols stuffed in their socks stormed the Serena Hotel in Kabul, a popular hotel for the diplomatic community. All of the gunmen were reportedly killed by Afghan troops.

Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attack, calling it “brazen and cowardly.”

Baird said the two slain Canadians were development workers not employed by the government and that consular officials in Kabul were gathering more information. The victims were identified as Roshan Thomas of Vancouver and Zeenab Kassam of Calgary.

Baird said the shooting was ""a tragedy for the families,"" and called for Afghan police to launch a thorough investigation.

""This is an example where people who are working in Kabul trying to promote values, development are under attack and we hope obviously there will be an investigation and people will be brought to justice,"" Baird said, before boarding a plane en route to the Netherlands for a nuclear security summit.

The Interior Ministry initially gave conflicting accounts of the victim's nationalities, but by late Friday said they included citizens of Canada and Paraguay. The U.S. embassy said a dual U.S.-Bangladeshi citizen was also killed. The foreign minister of Paraguay, Eladio Loizaga, told Reuters another civilian killed was a former Paraguayan diplomat who was in Afghanistan as an election observer.

The Afghan capital has been hit by several attacks, but authorities appeared stunned that the militants had managed to get through the tight security at the Serena Hotel — considered one of the safest places to stay in Kabul.

The attack in Kabul came just hours after the Taliban killed 11 people in an audacious assault on a police station in the city of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan.

The assailants were killed in both standoffs, but made their point: Afghan forces face a huge challenge in securing upcoming elections next month in what will be a major test of their abilities as foreign troops wind down their combat mission at the end of this year.

The attacks show the Taliban are following through on their threat to use violence to disrupt the April 5 vote, which will be the first democratic transfer of power since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the Islamic militant movement. President Hamid Karzai is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the assault on the Serena Hotel and the earlier attack in Jalalabad, an economic hub near the border with Pakistan.

""Our people, if they decide to attack any place, they can do it,"" he said.

4 attackers killed at Serena Hotel

The assault on the heavily fortified Serena Hotel lasted some three hours.

Four Taliban fighters snuck past security early on Thursday evening and hid inside the building for three hours before drawing the pistols hidden in their socks and opening fire on diners inside the hotel's restaurant, according to interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi.

They then battled Afghan special forces as terrified guests hid in rooms or fled to hotel bunkers. All the Taliban gunmen were shot dead.

During the attack guests crouched in bathrooms with the lights turned off as they listened to gunfire and people running up and down the hallways.

""I never heard an explosion or anything. Only firearms and possible rocket-propelled grenades,"" one senior U.N. official said in a text message from his darkened room.

One of the hotel's main saferooms, which was packed with guests and Afghan members of parliament, filled with smoke from a fire in the kitchen. ""It was hard to breathe. People started putting wet napkins on their faces,"" one witness said.

French news agency Agence France Presse said its Afghan reporter Sardar Ahmad, his wife and two young children were killed in the attack.

All the 18 U.N. staff members known to be inside had been accounted for, according to a U.N. official.

In Jalalabad, the violence began before dawn on Thursday when a suicide bomber blew up his explosives-laden car outside the police station, located near the palatial residence of Nangarhar provincial Gov. Attaullah Ludin.

Six gunmen rushed into the station as two more bombs exploded nearby — one hidden in a motorized rickshaw and another in a vegetable cart.

That prompted a fierce battle that lasted more than four hours, with Afghan police and soldiers chasing gunmen down the street amid gunfire and smoke billowing into the blue sky. Security forces killed seven attackers, Salangi said Thursday.

Police said the attack killed 10 officers, including a city district police chief, and a university student caught in the crossfire. Fifteen policemen were also wounded.

Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said the attackers wore suicide vests and killed nearly 30 police officers. The Islamic militant group frequently exaggerates casualty figures.

The initial suicide bombing badly damaged the nearby state-run Afghan radio and television building, shattering its windows.

The Taliban have carried out numerous attacks in Jalalabad, Kabul and elsewhere in the east. But the choice of a police station as a target reflected an effort to show they can still penetrate heavily secured areas despite numerous U.S. and Afghan offensives against them in recent years.

Afghanistan's upcoming elections include provincial votes, but the most closely watched is the presidential race. Karzai's successor will guide the country for the next five years as most U.S. and allied forces leave the country by the end of 2014.",Q1

SUBJECT: PAKISTANIS AT KANDAHAR BORDER FLAG MEETING -- THE

QUETTA SHURA IS A FABRICATION

Classified By: Interagency Provincial Affairs Deputy CooQnator Hoyt Y ee for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

1. (S) Summary. The high point of the September 29 Border Flag Meeting (BFM) in Kandahar was the Pakistani delegation leader's assertion that the Quetta Shura is an unsubstantiated fabrication. This BFM was the first at which the 5/2 Stryker Brigade joined officials from Canadian Task Force Kandahar, the Afghan Border Police, and the Pakistani military. The Canadians had a specific border cooperation agenda, the Afghans were more interested in insurgent interdiction, and the Pakistani side did not give either much importance. The next BFM on November 17 will be one among several opportunities for the U.S. to give AF-PAK border issues in the South -- especially reducing Taliban sanctuary in Pakistan -- the serious attention that they deserve. End Summary.

2. (S) The high point of the September 29 Border Flag Meeting in Kandahar was Pakistani delegation leader BG Sajjad's assertion that the Quetta Shura is an unsubstantiated fabrication. When pressed, Sejaad expanded on his position, saying that the Americans had fallen victim to rumors and adding that Pakistani security authorities have more than 80 patrols and checkpoints in Quetta every day and every night, and if there were any Taliban leaders around they would know about them. In a similar vein, he insisted that Taliban infiltration into Afghanistan from Pakistan was negligible, and that the group should be more concerned about terrorists and narcotics moving in the other direction. Recent press reporting on U.S. concerns about the Taliban presence in Baluchistan did not figure directly in the meeting.

3. (S) This BFM was the first in several months, and the first at which U.S. representatives from the 5/2 Stryker Brigade, including the commander, joined officials from Canadian Task Force Kandahar, the Afghan Border Police, and the Pakistani military. TFK Commander BG Jonathan Vance chaired the meeting, and the dynamics between the Afghan and Pakistani sides were so poor it was apparent that the session would have degenerated into acrimony without his multiple diplomatic interventions. The Canadian presentation was intended to advance border cooperation and associated projects based on the Dubai Process, covering the new Joint Border Coordination Center in Spin Boldak, progress with truck surveillance equipment, satellite phones, and construction of a new border facilities at the Weiche crossing to begin in 2010 (maybe).

4. (S) Afghan Border Police 3rd Zone Deputy Commander Col. Sharif was more interested in insurgent interdiction, and credited Blackwater training for the detailed list of seizures that included, among other things, 20 radios, 450 meters of wire, 800 detonators, and 62 prisoners. When Col. Sharif suggested that combined AF-PAK border operations would be the best way to demonstrate true willingness to cooperate, BG Vance reminded the group that policy was to focus on communications and confidence building measures through the JBCC.

5. (S) The Pakistanis essentially rebutted each Canadian point with a complaint or counter-point: 1) the Iridium phones were useless for cross-border communications, because the system was always busy; 2) they would not send any personnel for training on the Canadian-supplied truck surveillance equipment until they received a timeline of when the equipment would be operational; 3) it did not make sense to begin construction on a new border crossing facility when the Afghans kept the current Friendship Gate locked, and all traffic had to go around the side; and 4) the would make no commitment when Pakistani officers would actually arrive to man the JBCC. For their presentation, the Pakistanis displayed a map slide with 171 border stations between the southern edge of the FATA and Iran to demonstrate the excellent control they maintain on their side, along with another listing nine ISAF aircraft border incursions in the past two months with exact duration and meters of penetration, for which they demanded an accounting.

6. (S) The participants agreed in principle that the next BFM would take place on November 17 in Chaman on the Pakistani side. The agenda is to include an update on the JBCC, a 5/2 Stryker brief on their forces array near the, a TFK operations and intelligence brief on Kandahar, and an accounting of ISAF air incursions.

Campaigners are today planning to march to an RAF base which started flying armed drones over Afghanistan this week.

Members of the Stop The War Coalition, CND, The Drone Campaign Network and War on Want will march from Lincoln to nearby RAF Waddington.

The Air Force began remotely operating Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles deployed to Afghanistan from the Lincolnshire airbase earlier this week.

Organisers claim that the drones - previously operated from a US Air Force base in Nevada - increase civilian casualties and make it easier for politicians to launch military interventions.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the RAF said it had begun flying ""armed intelligence and surveillance missions"" remotely from RAF Waddington.

War on Want senior campaigns officer Rafeef Ziadah said: ""Drones, controlled far away from conflict zones, ease politicians' decisions to launch military strikes and order extrajudicial assassinations, without democratic oversight or accountability to the public.

""Now is the time to ban killer drones, before it is too late.""

Chris Nineham, vice-chairman of the Stop the War Coalition, claimed drones were being used to continue the ""deeply unpopular War on Terror"" with no public scrutiny, saying: ""They're using them to fight wars behind our backs.""

The Ministry of Defence claims the use of drones has saved the lives of countless military personnel and civilians.

An MoD spokesman said: ""UK Reaper aircraft are piloted by highly trained professional military pilots who adhere strictly to the same laws of armed conflict and are bound by the same clearly defined rules of engagement which apply to traditionally manned RAF aircraft.""",Q1

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif yesterday began a three-day official visit to Turkey. Nawaz met Turkey President Abdullah Gul and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Edrogan.

The two premiers later co-chaired the third meeting of the High Level Cooperation Council (HLCC) in Ankara. The HLCC provides a unique platform to give a long-term strategic direction to bilateral relations between the two countries.

Nawaz Sharif vowed to put a mechanism in place to boost trade and economic ties between Pakistan and Turkey during his visit.

“This visit is aimed at putting in place institutional mechanisms, which will provide a strong platform for further cementing economic ties,” he said according to an official press release issued yesterday.

Nawaz called upon Turkish businesses and entrepreneurs to invest in Pakistan, especially in sectors like energy, infrastructure, engineering and the agro-based industry.

He also emphasised Turkey’s role as a bridge between Asia and Europe and Pakistan’s potential to become a gateway to energy-rich Central Asia.

Turkey’s mediation in trilateral talks aimed at peace between Afghanistan and Pakistan was described by Nawaz Sharif as an important initiative aimed at promoting peace, stability and socioeconomic development in Afghanistan.

He said that “the menace of terrorism” in the region was the outcome of wrong policies in the past adding that their challenge is to root out this menace and Pakistan needs the cooperation and support of the international community and their neighbours for controlling fund, supply of arms and training to the terror networks.",Q1

The result reflects the rising popularity of the anti-immigrant, anti-EU party ahead of next year's municipal and European elections.

National Front (FN) candidate Laurent Lopez has won the cantonal by-election in Brignoles, a town in the south of France. Lopez won with 53.9 percent of vote against 46.1 percent for the center-right Union for a Popular Movement party (UMP) candidate Catherine Delzers, according to a final tally released by the local prefecture.

""This victory with an unambiguous score and a record turnout demonstrated that the National Front is a unifying party,"" Lopez said after the results were announced.

Sunday's election was the third attempt in three years to elect a district representative for Brignoles, which has a high population of North African-origin families in its center.

President Francois Hollande's Socialists did not field their own candidate in the first round. They backed a Communist ally who failed to make it into Sunday's run-off. They then called on supporters to back the UMP.

Lopez's victory in Brignoles, near the port town of Toulon, came three days after a survey published in French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur described the anti-EU FN as the country's main political force. The survey forecast a 24 percent share of the vote in the May 2014 elections for the European Parliament. It placed the FN ahead of both the ruling Socialist Party and the UMP union which took former President Nicolas Sarkozy to power.

""For the first time in a poll on voting intentions in an election of a national character, the FN is clearly ahead of both the [ruling] Socialist Party and the UMP,"" the main opposition party, the polling organization Ifop said in the article.

Since taking over as FN leader in 2011, Marine Le Pen (photo above) has tried to broaden the appeal of the party. Its image was closely linked to the personality of her 85-year-old father, who has convictions for incitement to racial hatred and for Holocaust denial.

http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/09/02/syria-credibility-and-historical-amnesia/,"Syria, “Credibility” and Historical Amnesia","My grandfather, who helped raise me, was not a weepy guy. That almost goes without saying for men of his age and background: second-generation German, a butcher’s son, who grew up during the Great Depression in a tiny, remote town near the Canadian border.

But I did see him cry a few times and one of those times comes to mind now.

I must’ve been about seven or eight years old. I asked my grandfather what he did during World War II.

He told me. Then he started to cry.

Paul F. Pein worked as a pharmacist until his death and as such had been trained in chemistry. He told me that after his entry into the service, the U.S. military moved him, his wife and his young daughter (my aunt) from Washington State to California.

There, in a factory, he made poison gas that went into shells.

I remember I had to ask him what a shell was. I imagined oversized bullets marked with skulls and crossbones rolling along an assembly line. I am pretty sure he said the gas was mustard gas.

I remember feeling disappointed. I suppose I had hoped he would open a hidden chest and show me the glittering dagger he had plundered from the corpse of a Nazi colonel slain in hand-to-hand combat.

It was many years before I began to understand what my grandfather had told me and why the memory so upset him. To this day I am still not sure that I have allowed myself to process all the implications of this buried history, so far is it from the myth of the Good War.

It seems the U.S. chemical warfare complex was no great secret back then. Approximately “250 sites in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and 3 territories are known or suspected to have buried chemical warfare materiel” dating to WWII, according to a National Academy of Sciences report published last year.

The Army is still cleaning it all up, slowly.

Then as now poison gas was always portrayed as a weapon of the enemy. Sure, we may have stockpiled the stuff in depots from sea to shining sea, but that was just in case the bad guys used it first.

One country’s atrocity was another’s just defense.

I wonder if one of the munitions my grandfather made might’ve been aboard the Liberty ship SS John Harvey.

No doubt he wondered the same thing.

The John Harvey was involved in what historians describe as the only known release of chemical weapons during the war. (Clearly that accounting sets aside the Zyklon B used in the German concentration camps.)

This is what happened:

“In 1943 there was a possibility that the Germans just might use poison gas. …Â Hitler, it was said, was not a great advocate of chemical warfare, perhaps because the FÃ¼hrer himself had been gassed during World War I. He was, however, ruthless and might be persuaded to use gas if he believed it would redress the strategic balance in his favor. Intelligence reports suggested that the Germans were stocking chemical weapons, including a new chemical agent called Tabun. “American President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a policy statement condemning the use of gas by any civilized nation, but he pledged that the United States would reply in kind if the enemy dared to use such weapons first. John Harvey was selected to convey a shipment of poison gas to Italy to be held in reserve should such a situation occur.”

A Luftwaffe raid sank the John Harvey while the ship was in port in an Italian city under British control. Everyone on board died in a great explosion.

The crew had not known about the cargo: 2,000 mustard bombs. The poison spread rapidliy through the water and air.

“Ensign K.K. Vesole, commander of [the nearby SS] John Bascom’s armed guard detachment, was having difficulty breathing. Many of the other men were gasping, but it was Vesole who noted something strange about the smoke. ‘I smell garlic,’ he said, without realizing the implications of his remark. A garlic odor was a telltale sign of mustard gas. The gas had become liberally intermixed with the oil that floated in the harbor and lurked in the smoke that permeated the area. “Mustard gas-laced oil now coated the bodies of Allied seamen as they struggled in the water, and many swallowed the noxious mixture. Even those not in the water inhaled liberal doses of gas, as did hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Italian civilians.”

The hospitals overflowed as doctors and nurses struggled to treat the “mysterious malady” afflicting so many sailors and civilians.

The story gets worse:

“British Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill was particularly adamant that this aspect of the tragedy remain a secret. … Churchill believed that publicizing the fiasco would hand the Germans a propaganda coup. “Although the gas was mentioned in official American records, Churchill insisted British medical records be purged and mustard gas deaths listed as the result of ‘burns due to enemy action.’ Churchill’s attempts at secrecy may have caused more deaths, because had the word gone out, more victims, especially Italian civilians, might have sought proper treatment.”

The author of this historical essay, Eric Niderost, concludes that it was “a tragedy made worse by the perceived exigencies of wartime secrecy.” Thus the imperatives of propaganda–the Allies’ need to be seen as the unambiguous good guy–multiplied the harm to the innocent.

Maybe there are lessons in this history.

Maybe YouTube videos by anonymous partisans don’t tell us everything we need to know about chemical warfare in Syria.

Maybe the imminent U.S. bombing campaign there has less to do with the use of chemical weapons than it does with global power politics and other “perceived exigencies” deemed unfit for public discussion.

Maybe Barack Obama’s “red line” is rhetorical cover for a fait accompli, as was George W. Bush’s last-minute ultimatum to Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Or maybe–more likely, I think–Obama is making it up as he goes along, as are his entourage of the “best and brightest” and the hawkish lifers in the military and intelligence establishment, always rushing in where there are no exits. The administration’s decision after to consult Congress after indicating that it would not is another sign that the White House is winging it.

The first casualty of war is truth

Make no mistake: Most of what you’ve been seeing and reading about Syria today is propaganda. The style and medium are different. But in subject and approach it is not much different than the propaganda directed at my grandfather’s generation and at his father’s generation during two successive world wars.

I’m not saying atrocities haven’t taken place in Syria–they almost certainly have, although the circumstances are unclear and will probably remain that way forever. The best propaganda begins with a truth. The atrocities in Syria are being magnified and exploited to further a political program which will certainly to result in more death, but which presents few clear positive outcomes.

That sort of exploitation has been the constant role of atrocity stories since World War I and long before.

The ongoing Propaganda: Power and Persuasion exhibition at the British Library features many fine exhibits, one of which is a copy of a 1916 book published in the United States with British backing. The book is called German Barbarism: A Neutral’s Indictment. It’s available for free online.

The book contains a full chapter on “German use of prohibited implements of war.” The chapter dwells largely upon the grievous wounds inflicted by “dum-dum” bullets, but Germany’s chemical arsenal also makes an appearance:

“Moreover, the German missiles used against the Russian troops often gave off poisonous gases which caused the death of the wounded, and which were expressly forbidden by the Hague Conventions (1899) ‘of which is to spread asphyxiating or noxious gases.’”

Such horrors, surely, could not soon be forgotten. But they were. The same generation of Americans so shocked by Germany’s use of poison gas on the European battlefield would order the production of huge stockpiles of mustard gas and nerve agents. Just in case.

That is the magic of propaganda: Correctly applied it can justify any action no matter how hypocritical. Americans killed by American mustard gas become the victims of “burns due to enemy action.” Nanking was an atrocity. Nagasaki was a necessity. Al Qaeda is our mortal enemy, except when it’s our ally. War crimes must be punished. But our comrade who ate that poor fellow’s heart, he must have been just a little over-enthusiastic.

The very day that Secretary of State John Kerry denounced the “cowardly…obscene” chemical attack by the Syrian government, documents emerged finally proving that the CIA had cooperated with Iraq in its 1988 chemical attacks on Iran. The documents were “tantamount to an official American admission of complicity in some of the most gruesome chemical weapons attacks ever launched,” Foreign Policy reported.

All this doublethink takes on a cumulative effect. As a consequence, most Americans are unable to form a valid opinion about the wisdom of further expanding the country’s military presence in the Middle East. (Not that the public will be seriously consulted.) The problem is compounded by a near-absence of independent reporting in Syria. The story of the civil war there is being told by the combatants, who have countless reasons to mislead, exaggerate and fabricate.

The combined result is a situation much like the prelude to WWI, when the public was clueless about the deals their leaders had cut with one another, and the leaders made epic misjudgments thanks to bad information and their own overconfidence. It was a set of circumstances in which “crucial decisions led from an isolated act of terrorism to the outbreak of a world war,” as the late historian James Joll writes in The Origins of The First World War.

Consider this passage on the crisis of July 1914, which followed the assassination by Serb and Croat nationalists of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand:

“The Austrians had believed that vigorous action against Serbia and a promise of German support would deter Russia: the Russians had believed that a show of strength against Austria would both check the Austrians and deter Germany. In both cases the bluff [was] called, and the three countries were faced with the military consequences of their actions.”

Sixteen million people died in that war.

One hundred years later our international order remains defined by secret diplomacy, veiled motives, spheres of influence and domino theories.

This is not about the Syrian people

David Ignatius, who finally apologized for “being wrong on the overriding question” of whether the Iraq invasion “made sense,” exemplifies the dangerous arrogance of the U.S. foreign policy establishment when he argued in favor of bombing Syria in an August 28 Washington Post column.

“The main rationale for military action by the United States and its allies,” Ignatius writes, “should be restoring deterrence against the use of chemical weapons.”

Note that Ignatius does not say “the main reason.” He says “the main rationale”–a word which has another sense than “reason.” Here “rationale” can be read as “the public explanation.”

The real reason for bombing Syria, as Ignatius makes clear–and as John Kerry himself concluded in his podium performance on August 31–is maintaining “U.S. credibility.” That translates to keeping Russia and Iran in line by “remind[ing] people that U.S. military power is not to be taken lightly.” As a casus belli that is somewhat harder to stomach than saving innocents from an evil, dictatorial war criminal. But there it is. Welcome to the moral universe of the delusional “strategists” who plague America’s op-ed pages.

Enforcing the chemical weapons taboo is entirely secondary. The safety of Syrian civilians, who have been killed by the thousands over two years of conventional war, is somewhere farther down the list. Only now, after having been gassed to death, have the Syrians become noteworthy and better yet, useful. Now they are pawns in a propaganda campaign.

In addition to obscuring the basis for U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war by substituting humanitarianism for realpolitik, Beltway propagandists are minimizing the consequences of the all-but ordained aerial bombardment to come.

Obama’s war plan is being described as “limited” and “focused,” much like the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were portrayed before the fact to a gullible press corps and a public thirsty for revenge.

Too few are asking the obvious question: What happens next?

Obama promises “no boots on the ground.” How long will that policy stick once it becomes clear that bombs alone will not make Syria a safer, more stable place?

The war cheerleaders of the Beltway are spouting some remarkable absurdities. Take Ignatius’s younger colleague at the Washington Post, Ezra Klein. Summarizing Kerry’s August 26 speech on Syria, Klein (or one his equally co-opted crew) wrote the following:

“‘Military action’ doesn’t mean war, of course.”

Oh yeah. “Of course.” Until I read that Wonkblog post, I was fairly certain that military action did mean war, in fact, was the very definition of war.

I don’t pretend to have a solution for the Syrian bloodshed. Maybe there is no “solution” that can be imposed by outsiders.

If America’s goal in Syria is to minimize civilian casualties, it’s hard to see how dropping bombs furthers that goal in the short term or the long term. If the goal, however, is to preserve the perception of America as an unbeatable, ubiquitous military power, then and only then does a bombing campaign begin to make sense.

At least Ignatius, abhorrent though his case for war may be, presented that case forthrightly.

Kerry was just as cynical, although less pithy, in his August 31 speech. (Evidently Ignatius had obtained the talking points in advance.) The Secretary of State grimly clocked through a series of unverifiable assertions presented in the administration’s unclassified intelligence report claiming “high confidence” in Syrian government-backed chemical attacks on civilians. The report cites “intercepted communications” but does not provide transcripts, leaving us to take it all on faith. It cites “one hundred videos” and “thousands of social media reports,” essentially asserting that thousands of Tweeters couldn’t possibly be wrong about something so important.

After dispensing with the obligatory “evidence” portion of his speech, Kerry got to the point:

“[O]ur concern is not just about some far-off land oceans away. That’s not what this is about. Our concern…is about choices that will directly affect our role in the world and our interests in the world. … “And it matters to leadership and to our credibility in the world.”

Obama, speaking after Kerry on that day, eventually tipped his hand, as well: “[N]ow is the time to show the world that America keeps our commitments,” Obama said, alluding to the “red line” he’d drawn earlier. “We do what we say.”

Obama might have been more blunt. It doesn’t matter what Americans think about this war in Syria–in fact, things will be easier for him if they go on not thinking about it. What the Syrians think matters even less. What matters is how Vladimir Putin and some Pentagon bullies will judge Obama’s manhood–excuse me, his “credibility.”

My grandfather was a troubled man in many ways but he had a sense of humor and, as I mentioned, a professional understanding of human physiology.

I think he could’ve settled this with a measuring tape.

This article was published 08/08/2013 (4205 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

There won’t be a big parade, but police will be celebrating their own Friday to mark National Peacekeepers Day.

The day celebrates the efforts of Canadians who have gone or are on peacekeeping missions, including about 3,000 police officers, said Assistant Commissioner Kevin Brosseau, commanding officer of the RCMP D division in Manitoba.

Aug. 9 is a date of significance for peacekeepers; it’s the anniversary of the 1974 deaths of nine peacekeepers whose plane was shot down over Syria.

Cpl. Gilbert Saillant kicks the ball around with young boys in Haiti.

The day of commemoration also has significance for RCMP, who lost two members in the 2010 Haiti earthquake while they were serving on a peacekeeping mission.

“This is something that’s obviously been of importance and significance for the RCMP and for policing for a number of years, but that memorial took on a special significance over the past few years,” Brosseau said.

The RCMP have a program in place that allows members to take part in UN peacekeeping missions, Brosseau said. Those who choose to go receive orientation about the countries in which they’ll be serving. Officers who have done tours give advice to those who are planning on going, he said.

“Police officers will call each other and say ‘What is it going to be like? What are the things that I’m not going to hear in those orientation sessions that I need to prepare myself for,’ ” Brosseau said.

RCMP officers have been sent to Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, South Sudan and the West Bank, said Sgt. Line Karpish, media relations officer for the RCMP.

RCMP Cpl. Gilbert Saillant went on a peacekeeping mission in Haiti from 2011 to 2012. He trained the Haitian national police while there and was struck by the poverty, violence and corruption.

“It’s poverty at the extreme. That’s the most shocking thing. Prior to going there, I’d never seen anything like that,” Saillant said.

The lack of resources and level of crime meant if there was not a “loss of life,” a call would often not get investigated by police. With so little support, Saillant said he had to learn to adapt with his job. He said he remembers one time when a police car they were supposed to use was out of gas. But there was no money to buy gas for the car. Instead, they siphoned gas from a broken-down car to use in the police cruiser.

“You learn to improvise and just to work with the flow… You have to use whatever is in your means,” Saillant said.

“There’s not a day I don’t think about the mission. Quite frankly, I think about it every day,” Saillant said.

If it weren’t for his family, he said he would go on another mission.

Brosseau said he’s heard how the missions affects the soldiers. He said it’s never easy letting members of the force go on these missions, but their experiences make them better officers.

“They’re going to be away from the communities they have to police here, (but) we get so much in return in terms of a much more culturally aware and sensitive police officer,” Brosseau said.

The men were dragged from their car in the Pashtun Kot district of Faryab province, which borders Turkmenistan, before being gunned down, provincial police chief Nabi Jan Mullahkhail told AFP.

“They were travelling in a car from (the provincial capital) Maimana to Almar district,” he said. “They were chased by Taliban suspects and their car stopped in Pashtun Kot.”

ACTED (the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development) condemned the killings and clarified the death toll at six after local officials earlier said seven people had died.

“Six Afghan employees were killed following an ambush that targeted a team of seven people. One person was injured,” ACTED spokesman Adrien Tomarchio said in a statement from Paris.

“They were killed in the course of their work to support development in the north. We deplore the deaths of our colleagues while they were carrying out their duties.

“Today our thoughts are with the families and relatives of our lost colleagues and our teams in Afghanistan.”

ACTED is a non-governmental organisation founded in 1993 that runs reconstruction projects in Afghanistan and across the developing world.

It runs 34 projects in Afghanistan, and last year had 864 local staff and 13 international staff in the country, according to its website.

Faryab provincial governor Mohammadullah Batash appealed for ACTED not to pull out of the region.

“ACTED is one of the most active organisations in Faryab, conducting many development projects, including on education issues,” he told AFP. “We will do our best to bring the perpetrators to justice. I hope ACTED continues its activities in our province.”

French foreign ministry spokesman Romain Nadal condemned the attack as “barbaric”.

The Taliban, who have fought a guerrilla war against the US-backed Kabul government since being ousted from power in 2001, were not immediately available for comment.

Northern Afghanistan is generally more peaceful than the south and east of the country, but Islamist insurgents, rival militias and criminal gangs are active in many districts.

http://www.dawn.com/news/1088922/no-simple-choice,No simple choice,"THE situation is not just about talks vs operation. The plot is far more complex than it appears. At the moment, an operation seems to be the better option; but there are many constraints. And as opposed to the state, it is the Pakistani Taliban, both ‘good’ and ‘bad’, that appear to be benefiting more from the current situation.

The political and security establishments have different perceptions of and responses to the quagmire of terrorism. While the security establishment takes a broader view, and factors in regional and strategic concerns, the political leadership has focused primarily on internal security. Nonetheless nothing should stop the two from evolving a common approach, though the government’s view of national security is still developing.

But the current dynamics of the Taliban insurgency demand a quick and vigilant response. As the situation is changing daily, the government has to come up with a flexible approach.

It appears that the security establishment is in a hurry to strike hard against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) before 2015 so that no one can use the banned group as a strategic tool against Pakistan — including the Afghan Taliban and Afghan security institutions.

As time passes, the feeling of uncertainty and unease is growing vis-à-vis the Afghan Taliban behaviour after Nato troops withdraw from Afghanistan. The major reason is that the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network have not used their influence with the TTP leadership and other militants on both sides of the border to get them to stop launching attacks inside Pakistan. It is feared that after 2015, the Afghan Taliban will continue to use the TTP as a tactical tool against Pakistan to maintain what they view as a strategic balance.

It is likely that some Pakistanis believe that if the TTP is dismantled or weakened enough before 2015, the Afghan Taliban would not be able to use them as a bargaining lever and will continue to look towards Pakistan for political support.

However, a full-scale operation in North Waziristan cannot guarantee the TTP’s elimination. There are two reasons. First, the TTP and its local and international affiliates have expanded their networks in other parts of the country and the number of terrorists’ sleeper cells is increasing. Second, the North Waziristan militants can relocate to Afghanistan and join Mullah Fazlullah’s forces thus becoming more problematic for Pakistan. It would be a nightmare for the establishment if these militants become strategic assets in the hands of Afghan security agencies.

In this context, a prolonged US presence in Afghanistan could become a stabilising factor in border security and Pak-Afghan ties. The US has its own reasons for maintaining its presence in the region. Apart from the Al Qaeda presence, it is concerned about Pakistan’s nukes. Besides, its presence in Afghanistan will keep up pressure on Iran, China, Russia and the Central Asian states.

There are compelling reasons for Afghans to support the presence of the US troops in their country. The capabilities of the Afghan National Security Forces to assume responsibility post-2014 is still a major concern for Kabul, which is not sure whether peace can be achieved without mainstreaming the Afghan Taliban. The latter believe their political and moral position will strengthen after 2014 even without a reconciliation agreement. They want to keep their allies and assets intact both in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In the former, they may not disturb elections on a large scale; in Pakistan they will support peace talks to buy time. It is for the first time that the Afghan Taliban are experiencing time constraints.

Interestingly, experts do not give a proper place to Al Qaeda in their analyses. Al Qaeda is another beneficiary of the regional conflict. For Al Qaeda, this is a golden opportunity to manipulate the situation in its favour as it enjoys the same influence over the TTP and other regional militant groups as the Afghan Taliban.

After failure in Mali and disappointment in Syria, Al Qaeda is again concentrating on ungoverned spaces in Iraq and the bordering areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Kunar and Nuristan provinces have been its primary hubs. This area can pose an even bigger threat than North Waziristan.

Pakistan is central to Al Qaeda strategies as the group’s priority is to bring revolution first in Pakistan and then to export it to other regions. Contrary to the Afghan Taliban, Al Qaeda will be the beneficiary of both options — talks with the TTP or an operation against it.

In the case of peace talks, Al Qaeda and its affiliates will gain more political and ideological legitimacy, and in the event of an operation, it will exploit the action against the militants to exert moral influence, and its nexus with the TTP will strengthen. But, the operational capabilities of Al Qaeda affiliates may be damaged temporarily.

In this context, an operation in North Waziristan and other militant pockets in the tribal areas will yield more than talks would. But will a full-scale operation be successful without Afghan and US cooperation? Sealing the border from the Afghan side wouldn’t be Kabul’s priority, while the US and Nato are unlikely to deploy troops on the border which will place them at risk.

Though the US has assured its support if Pakistan wants to launch a full-scale operation in North Waziristan, what can it do except to carry out drone strikes on the militants’ hideouts?

Afghanistan has many traditions that allow families to marry their daughters at young ages without their consent.

For example, there is a tradition in some provinces that allows families to engage two children even before their birth. Called Naami kardan in Dari, it means to promise the girl to someone.

In some places, families sell their daughters to another family for bride prices ranging from $1000 to $20,000. Families also exchange their young daughters for sons. All of this unfortunately makes child marriage a very successful business.

My neighbor’s story shows how unfair the situation is for girls and young women in Afghanistan.

Our neighbor has six daughters and one son, but the son has a mental problem. Last year, the family wanted to marry their son to a girl from a distant neighborhood, but the bride’s family would not agree to giving their daughter to our neighbor’s son because of his mental disorder.

Instead, the family in the distant neighborhood agreed to give their daughter to the father in my neighbor’s family. In exchange they received our neighbor’s daughter for their own son to marry.

After two years, our neighbor then was able to exchange one of their younger daughters, named Sunam, to another family who gave them a young girl who would marry their son with the mental disorder.

In this country, a girl who is trained in doing the chores, being obedient, and is kept a virgin, can be sold or traded without her consent. She is obliged to leave behind everything: her childhood, her friends, her family, her education.

These young brides miss out on education because once Afghan girls are married, they are not allowed to continue going to school. The laws don’t allow married girls to continue in school with unmarried girls.

I believe girls should be allowed to marry when they have finished their higher education and can stand on their own feet. Then they can educate their own children to become productive members of society, while continuing their lives as they want.

In Afghanistan, according to United Nations and UNICEF statistics, 57 percent of Afghan brides are under the age of sixteen, and the mortality rate for women dying in childbirth is very high: 18 percent.

The Pakistan Government met the Taliban for the first time yesterday in a last-ditch attempt to end the group's seven-year campaign of terror.

Critics believe that the talks will give the Pakistani Taliban undue legitimacy, but will fail because the militants will refuse to give up fighting unless the Government agrees to free imprisoned militants, withdraw from tribal areas and change its constitution - none of which the country's leaders are prepared to do.

The militants have already won one victory - the United States paused its drone programme to give Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif the political space to conduct negotiations.

The head representative of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which has conducted a terror campaign in the country since 2007 to topple the Government and establish a Sharia state, read out a joint statement at the end of the meeting in Islamabad.

""The Government team has laid down four basic conditions: that all talks be held within the framework of the constitution, that the scope of the talks should remain confined to areas disturbed by violence and not to the entire country, that all hostilities should cease during talks and that talks should be swift,"" he said.",Q1

WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina (Reuters) - The rare court-martial of a U.S. Army general charged with sex crimes will delve into explicit details of his adulterous affair with a female captain in two war zones, and alleged inappropriate email exchanges with several other subordinates.

The accusations led to Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair’s removal from command in Afghanistan in 2012 and his trial, set to begin on Tuesday at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, will shed light on how the military handles such complaints.

Proponents of military justice reform say the case underscores broader problems with the U.S. armed forces’ approach to sexual assault prosecutions and shows the need for an overhaul as such crime reports increase.

A chief concern, reform advocates say, is that the current system gives military commanders without legal training control over prosecutions, prompting accusations of partiality.

“This case is illustrating why the current system can be very counter-productive,” said Diane Mazur, a former Air Force officer and professor of military and constitutional law at the University of Florida.

Sinclair’s attorneys argue that defense officials facing intense political pressure to curb sexual violence in the military have targeted an officer who has served five combat tours with sex charges that hang on weak evidence and an unreliable primary witness.

The lead prosecutor in the case resigned less than a month before trial because military leaders were ordering him to proceed despite his doubts about the main accuser’s trustworthiness, according to the defense.

Claims of unlawful command influence and questions about the accuser’s credibility have overshadowed the array of disciplinary lapses of which Sinclair stands accused, including seeking nude photos from female soldiers, possessing pornography while deployed and mistreating subordinates.

SEXUAL ASSAULT REPORTS RISE

Preliminary data shows the military received approximately 5,400 reports of sexual assault in fiscal year 2013, a 60 percent increase over the 3,374 victims’ reports received in fiscal year 2012, a Defense Department spokeswoman said.

Lieutenant Colonel Cathy Wilkinson said Pentagon officials consider the rise in reports a positive sign that their efforts in the past year to crack down on sexual violence have bolstered victims’ confidence in the military’s response.

Defense officials oppose a Senate plan that would transfer the power to decide whether to try sexual assault cases to an independent military prosecutor. The military prides itself on being apolitical, and outside scrutiny has not factored into which cases result in charged offenses, Wilkinson said.

“They are pursued because they’ve been independently investigated and there’s been evidence that supports charging these crimes,” she said.

Whether Sinclair, who is among only a handful of generals to face a court-martial in recent decades, is guilty of sexual assault will be a central question posed to the five other generals who sit as panel members.

Sinclair, 51, a married father of two school-age children, admits to an affair with an unmarried 34-year-old captain. It began when they deployed to Iraq in 2009 and continued for several years through deployments in Germany and Afghanistan and time spent back in the United States.

Text messages, some of them sexually provocative, between the two soldiers reveal their mutual affection. “You make me happy,” Sinclair wrote in April 2011.

“You are my heart and world you beautiful magnificent man,” said the captain, whose name is being withheld by Reuters due to the nature of the charges.

But prosecutors also said the general threatened to harm her career and family if she exposed their relationship, and twice forced her to perform oral sex. The latter allegation is the basis for another charge, forcible sodomy, that could send Sinclair to prison for life, if he is convicted.

Sinclair denies ever engaging in nonconsensual sex, and his lead defense attorney said there is no evidence that the general abused his power or any of his subordinates.

“He had inappropriate behavior, but it’s not coercive behavior,” said Richard Scheff, a civilian attorney who is chairman of the Montgomery McCracken law firm in Philadelphia.

China and the United States get closer in regional cooperation in line with a new model of major-country relationship

This year has been an unusual one for China-US relations. Since US President Barack Obama started his second term and China completed a smooth leadership transition, leaders of the two countries have made a firm commitment to building a new model of major-country relationship that has charted a clear course to develop better bilateral relations.

Since the beginning of this year, Obama and President Xi Jinping have met more than once. Visits of other political and military leaders and dialogues between the two sides also tell us that the countries have put into practice the consensus that their top leaders have reached and started the process of building a new model of major-country relations. Both countries have also decided to actively explore a notification mechanism for major military activity.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi met US Secretary of State John Kerry on Sept 19. The next day, at the Brookings Institution, Wang noted in a speech that both countries have been working on strategic reassurance between a rising power and an existing major power. He said that ""we have never had the strategic intention to challenge or even replace the United States for its position in the world"" and that ""we have never thought about pushing the US out of the region"".

These statements are plain and straightforward and display genuine sincerity.

The statements are also factual. China has an edge economically, but security-wise it is still weak. With no allies or military bases overseas, China lags far behind the US in terms of military power. China does not have the capacity or intention to challenge the US position. Kerry reassured Wang that it was in US interests to see continued prosperity in China and maintain a partnership with China. He explained that the ""rebalancing"" strategy was not directed against China.

On the contrary, a strong partnership with China was, in itself, an important part of the ""rebalancing"" strategy. Statements are important, but actions are more important. It is hoped that Kerry's statements, and similar statements made by other high-ranking US officials, will be translated into actions.

China and the US have more converging interests and frequent interactions in the Asia-Pacific than anywhere else. At the same time, the two countries have come into dispute with one another more often in the Asia-Pacific than in any other region.

China-US relations are extremely important to peace and stability in the region, while regional developments may also impact China-US relations. In fact, the US ""rebalancing"" strategy has further complicated the security situation in the region.

Just as Wang stressed, the two countries ""shoulder increasingly greater common responsibilities"" toward the international community, but first and foremost toward the Asia-Pacific region. He went further to suggest that the Asia-Pacific should be turned into a ""testing ground"" for the new model of major-country relationship.

We have said, for some time, that the Taiwan question was the most important and most sensitive issue in China-US relations, as it encroaches on China's core interests. Now the Taiwan question is still important in bilateral relations but the more pressing issue affecting China-US relations is the way in which the US handles territorial disputes between China and some of its neighboring countries, including disputes over maritime sovereignty, rights and interests.

China has not asked the US for support. It has only asked the US not to interfere or meddle in these issues, or send out confusing, even erroneous signals. These issues are for China and relevant countries to settle through peaceful bilateral negotiations without external interference. This could be a test for the new model of major-country relationship.

To enhance cooperation between the countries is a fundamental way to build the new model of major-country relationship. Through efforts over thirty-odd years, a good foundation for cooperation between China and the US has already been laid. Economically, China and the US have become increasingly interdependent and neither can thrive in isolation of the other. In many bilateral, regional and global issues, the countries have also expanded their cooperation and increased their common interests.

China and the US could cooperate in a number of areas, including the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, cyber security, climate change, the peace talks between Palestine and Israel, and even on Afghanistan.

To stabilize the situation in Afghanistan, fight terrorism, crack down on drug trafficking and help Afghanistan develop its economy and improve the lives of its people are some of the areas in which China and the US may cooperate. Wang optimistically envisaged China-US cooperation in Afghanistan to be a new highlight in cooperation.

If the two countries expand cooperation to more and more areas and achieve mutually beneficial results through such cooperation, then a new model in major-country relationship will have been established.

According to media reports, the attack happened inside an Army base during a training exercise in the city of Gardez on the Pakistan border. The area has seen heavy combat between coalition forces and militant groups including the Taliban.

After the attack, other soldiers in the area quickly killed the assailant.

Officials haven’t confirmed if the assailant was a member of the Afghan Army or a militant who donned a stolen uniform. “Green on blue,” or insider attacks, killed 62 personnel in 47 incidents last year compared to 35 killed in 21 attacks a year earlier, according to NATO.

In the White House news conference marking the 100th day of his second term, the President said he had a full range of such ""options on the shelf"".

Beyond providing weapons and ammunition to the rebels, several government agencies are also drafting plans for establishing a protective ""no-fly zone"" over Syria and for targeted missile strikes, according to officials familiar with the planning. Officials said that Obama had not yet decided to proceed with any of the plans.

With the US disengaging from the unpopular war in Afghanistan and still smarting from the conflict in Iraq, Obama has been reluctant to unleash American military power in Syria.

In Damascus, a bomb ripped through a bustling commercial district, killing at least 14 people and bringing Syria's civil war to the heart of the capital for the second consecutive day.

""You will not be able to take Damascus by force and you will not be able to topple the regime militarily. This is a long battle,"" Nasrallah said, addressing the Syrian opposition.

""Syria has real friends in the region and in the world who will not allow Syria to fall into the hands of America or Israel.""

Hizbollah and Iran are close allies of Assad. Rebels have accused them of sending fighters to assist Syrian troops trying to crush the two-year anti-Assad uprising, which the United Nations says has killed more than 70,000 people.

Deeper and more overt Hizbollah involvement in the Syrian conflict is almost certain to threaten stability in Lebanon, which is sharply split along sectarian lines, and between supporters and opponents of Assad. It also risks drawing in Israel and Iran into a wider Middle East war.

Nasrallah said there are no Iranian forces in Syria now, except for some experts who, he said, have been in Syria for decades. But he added: ""What do you imagine would happen in the future if things deteriorate in a way that requires the intervention of the forces of resistance in this battle?""

Hizbollah has an arsenal that makes the group the most powerful military force in Lebanon, stronger than the national army. Its growing involvement in the Syrian civil war is already raising tensions inside the divided country.

Nasrallah also said his fighters had a duty to protect the holy Shiite shrine of Sayida Zeinab, named for the granddaughter of Islam's Prophet Muhammad and located south of Damascus. He said rebels have captured several villages around the shrine and have threatened to destroy it.

While Pakistan has said it was targeting militant hideouts, Taliban officials said the December 24 attacks killed some 50 civilians. The Afghan Defense Ministry vowed that it ""will not leave this despicable act unanswered.""

Taliban officials said most of the victims were ethnic Pashtun refugees from Pakistan's Waziristan region and were targeted just across the border in Barmal, a district in the southeastern Afghan province of Paktika.

Pakistan defended the air strikes, saying its security forces acted along its western border with Afghanistan to ""protect Pakistani people from terrorists.""

Pakistani authorities have repeatedly blamed the Taliban, the militant group that claimed power again in Afghanistan in August 2021, for providing ""hideouts and sanctuaries"" to the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamist militant group designated a terrorist organization by the United States. The TTP is banned in Pakistan and seeks to overthrow the government in Islamabad.

Experts say the latest tensions are indicative of the deadlock between the two neighbors, despite Islamabad's past support for Taliban militants.

""The Taliban and Pakistan are in a bind over the TTP,"" says Sami Yousafzai, a veteran Afghan journalist and commentator. ""Both have no good options and face dilemmas.""

Following the militant group's return to power in 2021, the Taliban government facilitated peace talks between Islamabad and the TTP.

But the truce it brokered failed in November 2022.

Since then, the Taliban has resisted Pakistani demands to go after its longtime ideological and organizational ally, the TTP, by expelling it from Afghanistan or pressuring it to surrender to Islamabad. Pakistan has accused the Taliban of supporting terrorism by backing the TTP.

In Pakistan, the TTP has waged a violent campaign to reestablish control in the country's western border regions abutting Afghanistan. For the last two decades, TTP militants have controlled parts of this region, fighting an ongoing battle against the Pakistani military.

Hundreds of Pakistani security forces have been killed in the TTP attacks, while local civilians have suffered under the militant group's draconian rule. On December 21, the TTP claimed credit for killing 16 soldiers in South Waziristan.

The Taliban government is reluctant to move against the TTP, Yousafzai says, because the militant group's presence in Afghanistan is ""just one part of a very complicated problem.""

Yousafzai says Islamabad's demand that the Afghan Taliban solve the TTP issue ""is not practical"" because of the high anti-Pakistan sentiment among Afghans. ""The Taliban is keen on ridding itself of the label that it once served Islamabad's interests,"" he says.

Islamabad partnered with Washington in its war on terror after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. But Pakistan also provided clandestine support to the Taliban insurgency that ultimately toppled the pro-Western Afghan republic.

This has won Pakistan few friends among Afghans, who blame Islamabad for their country's troubles.

Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud, news director at the Khorasan Diary, a website tracking militant groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan, says there is now little convergence of interests between the Taliban and Pakistan.

""Islamabad has exhausted all of its options to pressure the Taliban,"" he says.

The December 24 strikes were the fourth time Pakistani jets have bombed targets inside Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.

Since October 2023, Islamabad has expelled nearly 1 million undocumented Afghans. Pakistan has said those Afghans were living in the country illegally. Some of those expelled went to their ancestral villages, including in Paktika.

Pakistan has repeatedly closed its seaport and border crossings for trade with landlocked Afghanistan, further squeezing the country's struggling economy under the Taliban.

""None of these tactics has worked in the past, and it is unlikely to pressure the Taliban to abandon the TTP now,"" he said.

Mehsud says many in the Taliban feel ""strongly obliged"" to help the TTP, because it fought against the Pakistani military in the past to protect the Taliban and hosted their leaders and members while they were in exile in the country. ""They are brothers in arms because of the ideological and ethnic relations,"" he says.

Successive TTP leaders have pledged religious allegiance to the Taliban leaders, who preach an ultra-conservative form of Islam. Leaders of both groups are ethnic Pashtuns and have deep personal ties. Islamabad has also claimed a growing number of Afghans are fighting for the TTP.

There is little hope that the impasse between the two sides can be solved anytime soon. ""The Afghan Taliban is likely to push for gaining something major for the TTP, such as a formal recognition of its control over some region in Pakistan,"" Mehsud says.

But he sees Islamabad as unwilling to make such sweeping concessions.

Residents of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, where the TTP is most active, have held demonstrations against the militant group's return.

""Pakistan is likely to continue diplomatic engagement with the Taliban and kinetic actions against the TTP simultaneously,"" he said.

On December 24, Pakistan's special representative to Afghanistan, Mohammad Sadiq, held talks with senior Taliban officials as his country's military bombed alleged TTP hideouts inside the country.

Carrying out air strikes while diplomatic efforts are ongoing demonstrates Islamabad's ""complete disregard for another nation's prestige and sovereignty,"" says Obaidullah Baheer, visiting fellow at the South Asia Center at the London School of Economics.

He says Islamabad needs a ""very clear strategy"" for dealing with the TTP, because it cannot expect the Afghan Taliban to make an enemy out of its ally.

Another consideration, Baheer says, is that the Taliban fears pushing the TTP into the arms of Islamic State-Khorasan. The ultraradical group, a Taliban archenemy, claimed responsibility for killing a Taliban minister on December 11.

""The TTP is probably the only leverage the Taliban has over Pakistan,"" Baheer says.",Q1
http://www.dvidshub.net/news/112656/vanguard-mechanics-help-ana-repair-vehicles-increase-combat-power,"Vanguard mechanics help ANA repair vehicles, increase combat power","WARDAK PROVINCE, Afghanistan – U.S. Army mechanics from Company B, 703rd Brigade Support Battalion, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division advised Afghan National Army soldiers from the 2nd Kandak, 4th Brigade, 203rd Corps, on better methods to maintain their vehicles.



The goal of the training was to help Afghan soldiers repair vehicles in order to increase the 2nd Kandak’s overall combat power and give their fighting force an edge as they head into the fall.



Over a seven-day period, the Company B soldiers worked side-by-side with Afghan mechanics, training them how to properly conduct maintenance on a variety of armored Humvees.



U.S. Army Sgt. Evan Halladay, a wheeled vehicle mechanic assigned to Company B, 703rd BSB, and a Bloomington, Minn., native, was the noncommissioned officer in charge for the training and was one of the first mechanics to evaluate the Afghan’s needs.



“When we first arrived we needed to assess all the vehicles and we began pushing fluids through the systems to determine what else they would need,” said Halladay.



Once the group determined what was needed they were able to begin training the Afghan soldiers on how to fix the vehicles and the preventive measures they can take in the future. The repairs ranged from replacing tires and brake pads to rebuilding transmissions.



While working with the Afghan soldiers, the Company B mechanics also learned new techniques. U.S. Army Spc. Zachary Tygart, also a wheeled vehicle mechanic, with Company B, and a native of Kokomo, Ind., was impressed by the ANA mechanics’ ability to dissemble parts.



“They showed us how to replace a fly wheel a bit quicker by approaching it from a different direction,” Tygart said.



ANA Maj. Mohammad Saber, 2nd Kandak’s executive officer, spoke very highly of the training his soldiers received. “They were great soldiers who always helped us fix, replace, and rebuild parts,” Saber said.



Adding these newly repaired vehicles to their fleet will increase their overall combat power and give them additional capability as they fighting season winds down and the Afghans prepare for winter.



Together, the joint team of mechanics was able to return 20 vehicles to working condition. “This training has had a positive impact on our mission and we appreciate their help,” Saber said.

Islamabad, Wed, 11 Sep 2013 ANI

Islamabad, Sept. 11 (ANI): A Pakistan People's Party (PPP) leader has said it is easier to negotiate with the Afghan Taliban than Pakistani militant outfits.

Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah urged the PML-led government in the National Assembly to devise a mechanism to check the mushroom-like growth of militant groups in the country in order to improve the law and order situation, the Dawn reports.

He said that the government should hold a result-oriented dialogue with Taliban to stop terrorism and restore peace in the country.

He further reaffirmed that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) will extend full support to the government in this regard. (ANI)",Q1

In a written statement and subsequent video message, the Pakistani Taliban’s Mohmand wing said that the Pakistani soldiers were killed in retaliation for continued security operations against Islamist extremists. Omar Khalid Khurassani, a commander of the group, also accused Pakistan’s military of extrajudicial killings.

“We have warned the government time and again through the media to stop the killing of our friends, who were in the custody of security forces, but the government continued killing our people,” Khurassani said in the written statement. “So we executed 23 members of the parliamentary” Frontier Corps.

There was no immediate comment Sunday from Pakistan’s government or military, and Khurassani’s statement could be not be independently verified. But the Taliban, which is waging a bloody insurgency aimed at instilling Islamic law in Pakistan, has killed dozens of captured or kidnapped Pakistani soldiers over the years.

In January 2013, the Taliban released video showing the killing of 15 soldiers. A year earlier, the military recovered the bodies of 14 Frontier Corpsmen who had been tortured and shot multiple times after they were kidnapped in 2010.

Khurassani said Sunday that the 23 executed soldiers also had been captured in 2010, as they manned a checkpoint in northwest Pakistan near the Afghan border. They were killed, he claimed, because 16 militants thought to have been in prison had been found dead in various Pakistani cities in recent weeks.

Pakistan’s Frontier Corps largely patrols the country’s restive western border with Afghanistan, allowing the better-trained-and-equipped Pakistani army to remain focused on its historical foe, India, along its eastern border. Over the years, the Frontier Corps has endured heavy casualties as it seeks to contain Taliban insurgents who effectively control many tribal areas of northwest Pakistan.

If confirmed, the most recent killings could be a serious blow to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s effort to reach a negotiated settlement with Taliban militants.

After months of effort, Sharif's government entered into preliminary talks with Pakistani Taliban representatives three weeks ago. Since then, however, the country's struggle against terrorism and violence has only deepened.

Last week, the Pakistani Taliban took credit for a suicide bombing that killed a dozen police officers in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. And in the northwestern city of Peshawar, local officials have ordered the closure of all cinemas to try to protect residents from near-daily terrorist attacks from Taliban-linked groups.

The statement Sunday from the Taliban’s Mohmand faction, which operates out of the Mohmand district of Pakistan’s tribal areas, seems all but certain to put new pressure on Sharif and Pakistan’s new army chief, Raheel Sharif, to undertake a military operation against Taliban strongholds in northwestern Pakistan.

In early January, after Taliban militants killed 20 Pakistani soldiers in a suicide bombing, it appeared that the start of such an offensive was underway when the Pakistani military bombarded North Waziristan. But a week after those strikes, which killed 40 militants and reportedly drove tens of thousands of residents from their homes, Sharif appeared before parliament to announce that he wanted to give the peace process another chance.

He appointed a three-member delegation to represent the government. The Taliban also authorized a three-member delegation, led by prominent religious clerics, to represent it.

So far, the two sides have been unable to agree to a cease-fire, which Sharif has stressed is needed before more substantiative discussions can begin.",Q1

The army private has admitted to sending troves of material to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and pleaded guilty to charges that would send him to prison for up to 20 years.

The US military and the Obama administration were not satisfied, though, and pursued a charge of aiding the enemy, which carries a potential life sentence.

The trial on that most serious charge and 20 other offences begins today for the 25-year-old former intelligence analyst from Oklahoma.

It is the most high-profile case for an administration that has come under criticism for its crackdown on leakers. The six prosecutions since Barack Obama took office is more than in all other presidencies combined.

Manning chose to have his court-martial heard by a judge instead of a jury. It is expected to run all summer at Ford Meade, Maryland.

In February, Manning told military judge Army Colonel Denise Lind that he leaked the material to expose the American military’s “bloodlust” and disregard for human life in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He said he did not believe the information would harm the US and he wanted to start a debate on the role of the military and foreign policy.

The judge accepted his guilty plea to reduced charges for about half of the alleged offences, but prosecutors did not and moved forward with a court-martial on charges including violations of the Espionage Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Manning’s supporters hail him as a whistle-blowing hero and a political prisoner. Others view him as a traitor.

US officials have said the more than 700,000 Iraq and Afghanistan battlefield reports and State Department cables sent to WikiLeaks endangered lives and national security.

The release of the cables and video embarrassed the US and its allies. The Obama administration has said it threatened valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America’s relations with other governments.

Much of the evidence is classified, which means large portions of the trial are likely to be closed to reporters and the public.",Q1

“The soldiers were delighted that HRH Prince Charles contributed to our appeal.”

Along with Prince Charles, the Singapore Dawnwatchers counts a number of local and national businesses as its benefactors.

Mr Byrne added that soldiers showed their appreciation for the gifts in the letters they wrote.

“The letters we receive from soldiers – and which we shared with the Country Market ladies – show that just getting a parcel to show what people think of them is at least as important as its contents.

“Soldiers of the Intelligence Corps – bright and vibrant people – continue to serve in some of the least-protected and unpublicised jobs in the army.

“The loss of those killed in action is felt all the more in this small corps.”

You can check out at any time. More info

LABOUR veteran Tony Benn was hailed by political friends and foes alike yesterday after his death at the age of 88.

The party’s longest-serving MP died peacefully at his home in London with his family at his bedside.

His four children announced his death in an emotional statement, saying he had “sought to change the world for the better”.

Labour leader Ed Miliband led the political tributes, praising the Left-wing stalwart as a “champion of the powerless”.

Benn, whose wife of 51 years, Caroline, died in 2000, was admitted to hospital for treatment last month after feeling unwell but was allowed to return home on March 4.

His children Stephen, Hilary, Melissa and Joshua said: “We will miss above all his love which has sustained us throughout our lives.

“But we are comforted by the memory of his long, full and inspiring life and so proud of his devotion to helping others as he sought to change the world for the better.”

Benn was also hailed by MPs from across the political divide.

Prime Minister David Cameron said he was a “magnificent writer, speaker, diarist and campaigner”.

Born Anthony Wedgwood Benn, Benn was elected to the Commons in 1950.

But in 1960, he was disqualified from serving as an MP when he inherited his father’s title of Viscount Stansgate – as peers were barred from sitting in the Commons.

Benn campaigned for – and won – a change in the law to allow him to give up his title. He then returned to the Commons after winning a by-election the same year.

He went on to hold several Cabinet posts, including industry secretary and energy secretary, under Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan.

He stood unsuccessfully for the Labour leadership in 1976 and 1988.

When he finally quit the Commons in 2001, he famously said it was because he wanted to “spend more time on politics”. He then became president of the Stop The War Coalition.

Despite serving as an RAF pilot in World War II, he was a frequent opponent of military action, speaking out against the Falklands war and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.

First Minister Alex Salmond said yesterday: “His comment that he left Parliament in 2001 to spend more time in politics is one of the great political quotes of this period and all the more relevant since it coincided with his campaigning against the wars.

“I found Tony Benn supportive and helpful, regardless of political differences and it was on his unfailing courtesy to opponents that much of his cross-party respect was founded.”

Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: “This is a sad day but we can all celebrate an amazing life at the heart of British politics and public life.”

Miliband said: “He will be remembered as a champion of the powerless, a great parliamentarian and a conviction politician.

“Tony Benn spoke his mind and spoke up for his values.”

Miliband spoke of doing work experience with Benn as a 16-year-old and described him as “an incredibly kind man”, adding: “I may have been just a teenager but he treated me as an equal. It was the nature of the man and the principle of his politics.

“I saw him for the last time a couple of weeks ago in hospital.

“He may have been ailing in body but was as sharp as ever in mind. As I left he said, ‘Let’s have a proper talk when you have more time.’”

Cameron said: “There was never a dull moment listening to him, even when you disagreed with everything he said.”

Former Tory PM John Major called Benn “a true political warrior” while Tony Blair said he was a “genuine radical for all his life”.

He added: “He was a fearless campaigner and a legendary figure for the Labour movement. Even when I disagreed with him, I always had enormous respect for his brilliance and commitment to the people of Britain and the world.”

Mike Kirby, the Scottish Secretary of public sector union UNISON, said: “We have lost a true friend. An abiding memory for many of us will be his speech at the STUC’s People First March in October 2011.

“After marching through Glasgow in the worst rain imaginable, he gave a marvellous spirit-lifting address.”

Labour MP Diane Abbott recalled Benn’s softer side, speaking of his emotional response to son Hilary’s maiden speech as an MP. She said: “Tony came into the chamber, he sat a few rows in front of Hilary and his eyes were streaming with tears.”

Former MSP Tommy Sheridan revealed Benn had sent him a book with the inscription: “Thinking of you and Gail. In Unity” when he was jailed for perjury.

He added: “He once advised me not to be personal when criticising opponents. If you dance with the chimney sweeps, you will only end up getting dirty, he said.

“He was able to rise above personalities and tackle the real issues. Total Respect. Love and

Solidarity, Comrade. RIP Tony Benn.”

Former Labour MP Dennis Canavan writes:

I WAS a rookie Labour candidate when Tony Benn came to support my campaign at Bonnybridge Community Centre in 1974.

And at the start of the North Sea Oil era, I was privileged to serve with him on the Parliamentary Committee which set up the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC). Benn’s aim was to use public ownership to ensure that the benefits of North Sea Oil would not simply flow to multinational oil companies but would be shared by the people.

He also supported the idea of putting oil revenues into a special fund for future investment. Unfortunately, not everybody shared his vision.

Tony was a brilliant communicator who was at ease in Parliament or at an anti-war rally or in a miners’ welfare club. The working class loved him.

Union leaders like Jimmy Reid and Mick McGahey were close comrades and, more importantly, he was worshipped by rank-and-file miners and shipyard workers.

He was their voice, their champion, the greatest advocate of socialism in his time. We’ll never see his likes again.",Q1

By Jessica Donati

War took an increasing toll on Afghanistan's civilians in 2013 as fighting intensified between the government and insurgents, the United Nations said in a report on Saturday, with total casualties rising 14 percent.

The gradual withdrawal of foreign troops has left Afghan government forces more vulnerable to attack by insurgents, and the resulting battles helped account for last year's rise in casualties, according to the report.

""The new trend in 2013 of increased civilian casualties from ground engagements, including the alarming increase in women and children casualties, reflected the changing dynamics of the conflict over the year,"" the United Nations said.

Last year was the worst for women and children since 2009, with the number killed or injured by the conflict increasing by more than one-third from 2012.

About 27 percent of all 2013 casualties stemmed from fighting between the government and insurgents, and most of these could not be attributed to one side.

""This 'fog of war' dynamic reflects the changed nature of the conflict in Afghanistan in 2013 which was increasingly being waged in civilian communities and populated areas,"" the United Nations said.

The biggest single killer remained improvised explosive devices (IEDs), or bombs, detonated by insurgents in public areas such as markets, roads and government buildings. Bombs accounted for about one-third of the total civilian toll, which the United Nations put at 2,959 deaths and 5,656 injured.

While both sides in the conflict were responsible for the increase in casualties last year, the United Nationsattributed about three-quarters of the toll to the Taliban.

""Statements on protecting civilians by the Taliban leadership are not nearly enough to end the killing and injuring of innocent Afghan civilians,"" said U.N. Special Representative Ján Kubi in a statement.

""What is needed is for the Taliban to stop deliberately attacking civilians and using IEDS indiscriminately.""

""IMPUNITY""

International forces, who have handed over responsibility for security to the Afghans in preparation for their withdrawal by the end of this year, and say they participate only in joint operations, caused about 3 percent of casualties, according to the report.

While these make up only a fraction of the total casualties, air strikes causing civilian deaths or injuries are a major source of tension between President Hamid Karzai and the United States.

The U.N. report said that in 2013, there were 54 aerial operations that resulted in civilian casualties. While this was a 10 percent drop from the number of such cases in 2012, women and children accounted for nearly half of casualties.

Of the 54 cases, 19 were by unmanned aerial vehicles. The number of civilian victims from these so-called drone strikes more than tripled from 2012, the United Nations said.

The United Nations said there was a sharp increase in incidents perpetrated by a security force known as the Afghan Local Police (ALP), set up in 2010 to operate in remote, insecure areas.

Throughout 2013, the U.N. mission in Afghanistan ""documented incidents where ALP carried out serious human rights violations with impunity which were often enabled by provincial or national level power-brokers"", the report said.

ALP-linked casualties tripled, the United Nations said, and included summary executions, punishments and acts of revenge.

These were conducted with impunity, it appeared, as the United Nations was unable to find any information on prosecutions, suspensions or other action taken despite some 100 cases having been reported to the authorities.

On the positive side, the United Nations said many communities reported that they owed an improvement in security to the police.",Q1

http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/meshud-killing-an-attack-on-peace-process-pak/article5309162.ece,Meshud killing an attack on peace process: Pak,"A U.S.’ drone strike that killed Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud was an attack on the peace process, a top Pakistani government official said Saturday.

“The government of Pakistan does not see this drone attack as an attack on an individual, but as an attack on the peace process,” Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said.

“Either our comprehension is very limited or I am afraid the Americans have a lot to learn regarding what is happening in this part of the world,” he added in comments aired by the BBC.

Mr. Khan complained that on the one hand the United States articulates its support for the peace process in Pakistan and on the other it takes out the leader of the group with whom Pakistan is supposed to engage in discussions.

Mehsud was killed Friday, the day before the Pakistani government planned to send a delegation to explore peace talks with Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to end a decade-old conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.

Pakistani Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said earlier Saturday the government would not cease its efforts to seek a peace deal with the militants despite the attack.

“We had removed all hurdles in opening dialogue with the Taliban, and we will still try to build on that,” Rashid said.

It was not immediately known whether the Taliban was also interested in initiating a process of reconciliation.

A militant commander in the north-western town of Dera Ismail Khan said it was too early to say if the militia would still respond to government overtures.

Analysts said the future of the TTP and the proposed peace talks depend upon how well the new leader keeps the militia united.

“If the organization splits into many groups, it will not be easy for the government to deal with each one of them,” said Irfan Shehzad, lead researcher at an Islamabad-based think tank, the Institute of Policy Studies.

Intense infighting erupted within the Pakistani Taliban earlier Saturday about the nomination of new chief, members of the insurgent group said.

A shura, or council, of TTP first announced it had selected militant commander Khan Said Sajna as its new leader. However, that announcement was soon challenged by some groups within TTP.

Apparently a TTP meeting in Pakistan nominated Sajna, who is from the Laddah area of the South Waziristan tribal district, which is also near Afghanistan. However, a separate meeting in Afghanistan opposed the decision.

A militia commander said that the council would meet again to try and meet a decision, given the objections.

He said separate meetings were conducted to choose a new TTP leader in Pakistan’s tribal areas and in Nuristan province of Afghanistan, where some groups of Pakistani Taliban are in hiding.

Mehsud was buried Saturday, an official said. He had headed the banned TTP, a group of more than a dozen rebel outfits, since 2009.

He succeeded Baitullah Mehsud.

He and four other militants were killed when an unmanned aircraft fired four missiles at a compound in the Dande Darpa Khel area of the North Waziristan tribal district near the Afghan border.

A security official said the dead rebel leader and his associates were buried in different areas of the tribal region, but declined to give the exact locations.",Q1

They were 1st Lt. Jonam Russell, 25, of Cornville, Ariz.; Sgt. Stefan M. Smith, 24, of Glennville, Ga., and Spc. Rob L. Nichols, 24, of Colorado Springs, Colo., the Defense Department said in a release.

The victims, based at Combat Outpost Soltan Kheyl, were members of 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division. They were on patrol with Afghan soldiers in the village of Soltan Kheyl when a suicide bomber approached with a donkey concealing a bomb, according to local officials.

A translator was killed and four Afghan soldiers were wounded. The attacker, who was standing next to the donkey when the bomb detonated, also died, according to the commander of the Afghan army’s 4th Brigade.

Brig. Gen. Abdul Raziq said the troops had noticed the donkey on their way to and from the village, but there was other livestock in the area as well.

“It’s not the first time they’ve used a donkey,” Raziq said. “We have to learn our lesson. We have to be careful.”

Col. Kimo C. Gallahue, commander of the 4th IBCT, based at Forward Operating Base Shank, praised the courage of those killed.

“Those kids walk outside the wire every day because they walk out together,” Gallahue said. “We are in a risky business and there is great risk in everything we do, but I firmly believe that we are doing the right thing here at the right time.”

Casualties among NATO soldiers have dropped significantly as the coalition scales back its presence on the battlefield and as Afghan forces increasingly take the lead in operations.

However, Afghan troops have suffered increasingly heavy losses. Earlier this week, the Afghan Ministry of the Interior revealed that more than 2,700 police officers have been killed since March 21, an average of 22 police deaths per day.

While the U.S. military can win wars with overwhelming firepower, the conventional wisdom is that the U.S. lacks effective civilian tools to win the peace. Afghanistan's public health care system provides a powerful counterpoint: financed largely by American foreign aid, it has produced the most rapid increase in life expectancy observed anywhere on the planet. What went right? And why do American auditors and Congressional overseers suddenly want to pull the plug?

In late 2011, the U.S. Agency for International Development announced some astonishing news about progress in health and mortality in Afghanistan. The new findings came from the release of the 2010 Afghanistan Mortality Survey, the largest survey of its kind ever undertaken in Afghanistan. The survey showed that from 2004 to 2010, life expectancy had risen from just 42 years--the second lowest rate in the world--to 62 years, driven by a sharp decline in child mortality. As a result, nearly 100,000 Afghan children per year who previously would have died now don't.

In terms of lives saved, it is as if the entire Syrian tragedy were averted thanks to a U.S. aid program few Americans had ever heard of.

In terms of lives saved, it is as if the entire Syrian tragedy were averted thanks to a U.S. aid program few Americans had ever heard of.

This accomplishment was not just a victory for ""aid,"" generically. Afghanistan's progress against mortality reflects the particular success of a way of doing aid in the health sector that differed dramatically from the amateurish, militarized, and externally imposed modus operandi of the bulk of American aid to Afghanistan during the war.

""Winning hearts and minds"" has been the informal rallying cry for the majority of our aid efforts in the country. As money poured into country in 2003, aid projects largely ignored the poorest areas and instead targeted hotspots of insurgent activity. Aid workers took orders from military commanders who erred toward making a visible splash rather than a long-term impact. Not only did these projects build schools and clinics without budgeting for teachers or nurses, in the case of two schools in southern Afghanistan--an area of frequent seismic activity--U.S. auditors found military contractors had built walls so flimsy they couldn't support the schools' concrete roofs.

Afghanistan's health program bucked this trend toward ""quick impact, quick collapse"" projects, as aid workers mockingly called them. Rather than going it alone, the U.S. teamed up with European donors and the World Bank in a multilateral effort. And rather than cutting sweetheart deals with American military contractors, the health program was coordinated by the Afghan government's own Ministry of Public Health. Most radical of all, the program focused on measureable results, commissioning an independent evaluation by a team from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

By the end of Taliban rule in 2002, Afghanistan's public health system had collapsed. To begin to resuscitate it, aid donors and the Afghan government devised a basic package of health services that cost about $4.50 per person. Recognizing the government's limited reach in many provinces, they contracted national and international NGOs to help them deliver this basic package of services across 90% of the country. From 2004 to 2010, the Johns Hopkins team found that in the typical Afghan district, the share of clinics meeting minimum staffing levels had risen from roughly 40% to nearly 90%, and the proportion who met their annual target of at least 750 new outpatient visits rose from around 20% to over 80%. As a result, access to basic services like vaccination and family planning advice was way up.

Despite these successes, the health program has met resistance from an unexpected source: auditors.

***

John Sopko is the U.S. government's chief auditor for Afghanistan and a former prosecutor with years of experience on Capitol Hill. In September, Sopko's office--the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR--issued a report calling for the suspension of USAID's $236 million in aid for basic health care in Afghanistan.

Why shut down such a successful program? The short answer is that SIGAR's is a peculiar concept of caution.

Strikingly, the auditors' report calling for the funding freeze for the health program doesn't claim any evidence of serious fraud or waste. Instead, it raises hypothetical concerns about the Afghan government's ability to manage aid money well, including evidence that some salaries were paid in cash, as well as the absence of double entry bookkeeping.

While the U.S. military can produce receipts for bombs and bullets bought in America, the Afghan government struggles to do the same for vaccines dispensed in remote rural clinics. Thus, from a government auditor's perspective, it is riskier to give Afghan citizens health care than to shoot their insurgents.

Sopko had already appealed to Congress to reconsider future aid to the Afghan government. Over the summer, the SIGAR public affairs office launched an accompanying media blitz, complete with a New York Times editorial expressing grave concern over ""lapses in accountability,"" and a Twitter account tweeting mundane ways in which U.S. agencies are failing: ""State Dept. never finalized draft 2010 U.S. anti-corruption strategy for #Afghanistan,"" or ""USAID could not provide documentation showing methodology used to calculate $236M program cost estimate."" This outreach culminated with a publicity stunt demanding that State Department, Pentagon, and USAID officials engage in public self-criticism by nominating a top 10 list of their own worst aid projects.

Unsurprisingly, Sopko's anti-government spending campaign caught the attention of Tea Party members in Congress, who took up his talking points that giving money to Afghanistan was simply too risky. Notably, the concept of risk used here is completely unrelated to the 20% risk of death before age five faced by Afghan children as of 2004; a risk which has declined by half with the help of American aid.

***

Since 2001, USAID has been called on to assist U.S. military efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond, as the softer side of a counter-insurgency strategy. And aid has shared the blame for the failure of that strategy. ""President Obama's strategy depended upon the civilian experts at USAID making smart decisions to help the Afghans,"" writes the Washington Post's Rajiv Chandrasekaran in his book on the Obama administration's surge in Afghanistan. ""But the agency kept making mistakes ... The result was a gross failure to capitalize on security improvements, paid for by the lives and limbs of American troops.""

Aid will never be a substitute for a military strategy. Aid is not a counter-terrorism policy. But the lesson of USAID in Afghanistan is not that help is futile; on the contrary. When America gives aid for the sake of saving lives rather than winning hearts and minds, it can be incredibly effective, even in the inauspicious conditions of rural Afghanistan.

Beyond hunting Osama Bin Laden to make America safer, American leaders have sold the war in Afghanistan in lofty terms, as an altruistic fight for the benefit of Afghan women and children terrorized under Taliban rule. When presented with the means and the opportunity to save the lives of thousands of those very same mothers and infants, if America retreats on the grounds of procurement rules and auditing queries, this narrative becomes hard to maintain.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/pakistan-family-drone-victim-testimony-congress,Drone strikes: tears in Congress as Pakistani family tells of mother's death,"The family of a 67-year-old midwife from a remote village in North Waziristan told lawmakers on Tuesday about her death and the ""CIA drone"" they say was responsible. Their harrowing accounts marked the first time Congress had ever heard from civilian victims of an alleged US drone strike.

Rafiq ur Rehman, a Pakistani primary school teacher who appeared on Capitol Hill with his children, Zubair, 13, and Nabila, 9, described his mother, Momina Bibi, as the ""string that held our family together"". His two children, who were gathering okra with their grandmother the day she was killed, on 24 October 2012, were injured in the attack.

""Nobody has ever told me why my mother was targeted that day,"" Rehman said, through a translator. ""Some media outlets reported that the attack was on a car, but there is no road alongside my mother’s house. Others reported that the attack was on a house. But the missiles hit a nearby field, not a house. All of them reported that three, four, five militants were killed.""

Instead, he said, only one person was killed that day: ""Not a militant but my mother.""

""In urdu we have a saying: aik lari main pro kay rakhna. Literally translated, it means the string that holds the pearls together. That is what my mother was. She was the string that held our family together. Since her death, the string has been broken and life has not been the same. We feel alone and we feel lost.""

An Amnesty International report, published last week, lists Bibi among 900 civilians they say have been killed by drone strikes, a far higher number than previously reported. The Amnesty report said the US may have committed war crimes and should stand trial for its actions.

The US has repeatedly claimed very few civilians have been killed by drones. It argues its campaign is conducted ""consistent with all applicable domestic and international law"". Unofficial reports, however, have suggested that hundreds have been killed in Pakistan alone, with up to 200 children killed.

In poignant testimony, Rehman's son, Zubair, described the day of the attack, the day before the Muslim holy day of Eid, as a ""magical time filled with joy"". He told lawmakers that the drone had appeared out of a bright blue sky, the colour of sky most beloved by his grandmother and himself, he said.

""As I helped my grandmother in the field, I could see and hear the drone hovering overhead, but I didn’t worry"" he said. ""Why would I worry? Neither my grandmother nor I were militants.""

""When the drone fired the first time, the whole ground shook and black smoke rose up. The air smelled poisonous. We ran, but several minutes later the drone fired again. ""

""People from the village came to our aid and took us to hospital. We spent the night in great agony in at the hospital and the next morning I was operated on. That is how we spent Eid.""

Zubair said that fear over the drone attacks on his community have stopped children playing outside, and stopped them attending the few schools that exist. An expensive operation, needed to take the shrapnel out of his leg, was delayed and he was sent back to the village until his father could raise the money, he said.

“Now I prefer cloudy days when the drones don’t fly. When the sky brightens and becomes blue, the drones return and so does the fear. Children don’t play so often now, and have stopped going to school. Education isn’t possible as long as the drones circle overhead.”

According to Zubair, the fundraising took months.

His sister, Nabila, told lawmakers that she had been gathering okra with her brother and grandmother when she saw a drone and ""I heard the dum dum noise.""

""Everything was dark and I couldn't see anything. I heard a scream. I think it was my grandmother but I couldn't see her.

""All I could think of was running.""

Rehman told lawmakers that he is seeking answers to why his mother was targeted. The strike has affected his wider family, who no longer visit because they fear the drones might kill them too.

In testimony that caused the translator to stop and begin to weep, he said: ""Congressman Grayson, as a teacher, my job is to educate. But how do I teach something like this? How do I explain what I myself do not understand? How can I in good faith reassure the children that the drone will not come back and kill them, too, if I do not understand why it killed my mother and injured my children?""

He said that his mother was not the first innocent victim of drone strike, but that ""dozens of people in my own tribe that I know are merely ordinary tribesman had been killed"". He said that numerous families in his community and the surrounding area had lost loved ones, including women and children over the years.

""They have suffered just like I have. I wish they had such an opportunity as well to come tell you their story. Until they can, I speak on their behalf as well. Drones are not the answer.""

Rehman said that although the Pakistani government accepted his claim and confirmed details, it said it was not responsible and he has had no compensation to help with the medical treatment for his children.

Rehman said: ""In the end I would just like to ask the American public to treat us as equals. Make sure that your government gives us the same status of a human with basic rights as they do to their own citizens. We do not kill our cattle the way US is killing humans in Waziristan with drones. This indiscriminate killing has to end and justice must be delivered to those who have suffered at the hands of unjust.""

Asked what he would say to President Barack Obama, Rehman called on the Pakistani and US government to work together to achieve peace.

""I would say to President Obama if I had the opportunity to meet with him is: 'What happened to me and my family was wrong'. I would ask him to find an end, a peaceful end, to what is happening.""

""I think that's something that the American government and the Pakistani government can work together to achieve.""

Missing from the briefing on Tuesday was the account of Shahzad Akbar, an international critic of US drone policy and the family lawyer, who spearheaded the idea of bringing civilian victims of drone strikes to Congress and who was refused a visa for the third time. Reprieve, the British rights group which together with Brave New Foundation, helped the Rehman family travel to Washington, said he had 6,000 letters supporting his visit.

The hearing was attended by only five members of Congress, and Grayson said such low numbers of lawmakers at hearings were not unusual. Those attending were all Democrats: Rush Holt of New Jersey, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, John Conyers of Michigan, Rick Nolan of Minnesota, and Grayson, the Florida Democrat responsible for inviting the family to Washington and for holding the hearing.

Each of the lawmakers spoke about the drone programme to call for more transparency or greater oversight. Schakowsky said she agreed with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and their call for more transparency and debate about the targeted killing programme. Holt and Conyers called for a congressional investigation into drone strikes.

Grayson, a fierce critic of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan told the hearing: ""Invading from the skies is no different from invading on the grounds. We should never accept that children and loved ones are acceptable collateral damage.” Was there any other human activity, he asked “where 10-30% of the dead are innocent?”

Zaid Hamid, who is popular on Pakistani television channels



On August 11, 2013, Pakistani television channel ARY News telecast a current affairs program called Sawal Ye Hai (This Is The Question), hosted by Dr. Danish.[1] There were two participants on the talk show, both of whom were described as defense analysts: Zaid Hamid and Air Marshall (Ret.) Shahid Latif.

The participants, including the television host Dr. Danish, addressed a number of questions regarding Pakistan-India relations. Excerpts are given below from a long, single segment from the program in which Zaid Hamid speaks about how Pakistan should treat India's presence in Afghanistan after the U.S. troop withdrawal planned by the end of 2014.

""Afghanistan Is A Muslim Country And Only Muslim Countries Will Decide Its Fate; Turkey, Iran, And Pakistan Will Sit Together And Jointly Decide About Afghanistan; There Is No Place For Hindu Polytheists There""

TV Anchor Dr. Danish: ""Zaid Sahib, 2014 is at hand and we see that on this occasion there is [Barack] Obama's policy statement that there [in Afghanistan] would be zero presence [of U.S. troops]. In this situation, you know about the one border of Pakistan, and my faulty sources say, that India has more role [to play] there [in Afghanistan] than Pakistan. India's presence is 500 times more powerful there in comparison to Pakistan, and the U.S. wants to give it much power there. What will happen in the future, and what do you see in 2014?""

Zaid Hamid: ""Danish, if you truly ask me, I pray to Allah that the Americans withdraw from [Afghanistan], and leave the Indians there; it has been a long time since we massacred Hindus in Afghanistan. Historically, it was always like that, and that is why the mountains in Afghanistan are called 'Hindu Kush.' 'Hindu Kush' means a place where Hindus are to be beheaded, a place that kills Hindus. Historically, whenever Hindus entered Afghanistan, they were butchered there.

""We pray to Allah that the U.S. withdraws from Afghanistan, and leaves the Bania [Hindu merchants] in their place. The things we would do to the Bania in Afghanistan would make them refrain from looking toward Afghanistan and Pakistan for thousands of years. The elements of the Karzai government cannot sustain themselves in Afghanistan after the Americans' exit, no matter how many troops India puts there. Afghan Taliban have always been supporters of Pakistan; [they] are loyal, our neighbor, and our brethren.

""And Tajiks and Uzbeks in Afghanistan have also understood this very well, that the enmity they had struck with Pakistan, the misunderstanding they had developed with Pakistan due to the Afghan Taliban, it is time to do away it. Afghanistan is a Muslim country and only Muslim countries will decide its fate. Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan will sit together and jointly decide about Afghanistan. There is no place for Hindu polytheists there. Afghan Taliban are waiting for this, that they would bury Hindu polytheists there as they have buried the Americans. We are praying for that. They are not a problem for us.

""We have problems only [as long as] there remain the Americans. In the presence of Americans, the way India and RAW [Research and Analysis Wing, the external spy agency of India] are sending TTP and BLA [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Balochistan Liberation Army militants into Pakistan] and their bases are in place in Afghanistan, that period is dangerous for us, and that period is the coming one and one-and-a-half years.""

""[Hindu/Indian] Polytheists Don't Know This, That If They Poke Us Once, We Will, By Allah, Reach Delhi By Liberating Kashmir, And This Has Been Our history; From The Hindu Kush Mountains To Delhi, This Region Does Not Belong To Hindus""

""Today the whole of Indian media, Indian Parliament, [and the] Indian army chief are talking about attacking Pakistan on [the issue of firing in Kashmir across] Line of Control because they see that the Pakistani state is collapsing, the government is confused, the Pakistani army does not enjoy support from judiciary, media, and the government. You have deployed the army personnel in jails and in cleaning the streets of Karachi [from criminals].

""This is a time for India to wage a serious limited war against Pakistan. And they want to do it. There is no doubt in it now. And if they don't do it, it would be because of this - only that you take an aggressive posture in Pakistan and threaten India with a mouth-breaking reply if it tried to cross the Line of Control border with Pakistan.

""If the Pakistani state and government does not do this then in coming few weeks and months, be ready [for war] because Indians are not creating this hype without any rhyme or reason. There is reason in that. At this time when we are talking here, there is war continuing at the Line of Control between Pak[istani] forces & Rangers and the Indian army. Indian army chief has said it only yesterday, that they want to do a limited war with Pakistan by attacking the Pakistan army. That war would neither be limited nor conventional.

""They live in a fool's paradise, and these polytheists don't know this, that if they poke us once, we would, by Allah, reach Delhi by liberating Kashmir, and this has been our history. From the Hindu Kush Mountains to Delhi, this region does not belong to Hindus; this is the region of Muslims. If temporarily Hindus are present there, then it is a matter of time being and by Allah that would also continue happening in future what has been happening for the past thousand years.""",Q1

Arriving in Pakistan on a day-long visit,Karzai,who has long accused Pakistan of playing a double game in the Afghan war,made his appeal in talks with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who promised to extend all possible assistance.

“We discussed in this regard primarily and with emphasis the issue of joint fight against extremism and reconciliation in Afghanistan with the expectation that the Government of Pakistan will facilitate and help in manners it can to the peace process in Afghanistan and providing opportunities on all platforms for talks between Afghan High Peace Council and the Taliban movement,” Karzai said.

The Afghan President said the primary concern for both countries is the lack of security for their citizens and the continuing menace of terrorism.

“It is this area that needs to have primary focussed attention by both countries. It is with hope on this that I have come to Pakistan and to advance efforts and action together so that we can have peace in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” Karzai said addressing TV cameras.

Sharif on his part said his government has assumed office with the resolve to create a peaceful external environment so that it can focus on Pakistan’s domestic priorities.

“Being in a cooperative and stable relationship with all our neighbours is a vital component of this vision. Our security and future prosperity is linked to Afghanistan in multiple ways. President Karzai is visiting at an important juncture in his country’s history,” Sharif said.

Ties between the two countries nosedived after Pakistan and the US supported a Taliban office that opened in Doha in June to foster talks. Karzai was infuriated by the opening of the Taliban office,considered a precursor towards talks with US officials. He now wants Pakistan to help open dialogue with the Taliban which has refused all contact with Kabul.

Afghanistan has often accused Pakistani elements of aiding the Afghan Taliban.

Karzai was also upset over a reported statement in June by Pakistan’s National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz that Kabul should cede some Afghan provinces to the Taliban for lasting peace.

“We focussed on common challenges that we face. I stressed to President Karzai the importance that Pakistan attaches to peaceful,stable and united Afghanistan. I also reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong and sincere support for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan,” Sharif said.

“We fully agree that this process has to be inclusive,Afghan-owned and Afghan-led. I assured Karzai that Pakistan will continue to extend all possible facilitations,” he said.

He said Pakistan will also help reinforce regional support in stabilisation of Afghanistan. “It is also indispensable for our positive agenda of peace and development,” he added.

Both sides also talked about increasing bilateral cooperation in the field of economy and connectivity.

Karzai said Pakistan,as a friend and neighbour can expect good from Afghanistan just as Afghanistan expects the same from Pakistan.

The Afghan President said he informed Sharif about Kabul’s regional and international relations.

He underlined that Afghanistan’s relations with countries of the world and in the region will only be beneficial to the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Pakistan has been sceptical of Afghanistan’s strategic engagement with India.

This is the first highest-level exchange between Pakistan and Afghanistan since the democratic transition and swearing-in of the new government here.

This is also Karzai’s first visit to Islamabad in 18 months and could be crucial in overcoming hostility ahead of the massive troop pullout in 2014 by the US-led NATO forces.

Pakistan too wants some sort of political settlement between Kabul and the Taliban to avoid a civil war scenario at its restive border.

But there is pervasive suspicion about Pakistan’s long term objective and role of its ISI intelligence agency in backing the Taliban.

Islamabad also allegedly torpedoed an effort by Kabul to strike a deal with the militants by arresting Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Barader from Karachi in 2010.

http://www.straight.com/blogra/532576/text-hacktivist-jeremy-hammonds-courtroom-statement,Text of hacktivist Jeremy Hammond's courtroom statement,"1 of 1 2 of 1

Jeremy Hammond, a 28-year-old political activist, was sentenced in the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York on November 15 to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to participating in the Anonymous hack into the computers of the private intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting (Stratfor) and obtaining emails and account data on 860,000 subscribers, including credit-card information on 60,000 people.

Prior to sentencing, Hammond read out the following statement in open court.

Chief Judge Loretta A. Preska ordered several country names to be redacted (marked by Xs) from one paragraph near the bottom of the statement.

Preska is married to Thomas J. Kaveler, an employee of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, a Stratfor client and associate; his email address was one of many revealed as a result of Hammond’s hacking activities. Despite this fact, Preska refused to recuse herself from the case.

JEREMY HAMMOND’S SENTENCING STATEMENT 11/15/2013

Good morning. Thank you for this opportunity. My name is Jeremy Hammond and I’m here to be sentenced for hacking activities carried out during my involvement with Anonymous. I have been locked up at MCC for the past 20 months and have had a lot of time to think about how I would explain my actions.

Before I begin, I want to take a moment to recognize the work of the people who have supported me. I want to thank all the lawyers and others who worked on my case: Elizabeth Fink, Susan Kellman, Sarah Kunstler, Emily Kunstler, Margaret Kunstler, and Grainne O’Neill. I also want to thank the National Lawyers Guild, the Jeremy Hammond Defense Committee and Support Network, Free Anons, the Anonymous Solidarity Network, Anarchist Black Cross, and all others who have helped me by writing a letter of support, sending me letters, attending my court dates, and spreading the word about my case. I also want to shout out my brothers and sisters behind bars and those who are still out there fighting the power.

The acts of civil disobedience and direct action that I am being sentenced for today are in line with the principles of community and equality that have guided my life. I hacked into dozens of high profile corporations and government institutions, understanding very clearly that what I was doing was against the law, and that my actions could land me back in federal prison. But I felt that I had an obligation to use my skills to expose and confront injustice—and to bring the truth to light.

Could I have achieved the same goals through legal means? I have tried everything from voting petitions to peaceful protest and have found that those in power do not want the truth to be exposed. When we speak truth to power we are ignored at best and brutally suppressed at worst. We are confronting a power structure that does not respect its own system of checks and balances, never mind the rights of it’s own citizens or the international community.

My introduction to politics was when George W. Bush stole the Presidential election in 2000, then took advantage of the waves of racism and patriotism after 9/11 to launch unprovoked imperialist wars against Iraq and Afghanistan. I took to the streets in protest naively believing our voices would be heard in Washington and we could stop the war. Instead, we were labeled as traitors, beaten, and arrested.

I have been arrested for numerous acts of civil disobedience on the streets of Chicago, but it wasn’t until 2005 that I used my computer skills to break the law in political protest. I was arrested by the FBI for hacking into the computer systems of a right-wing, pro-war group called Protest Warrior, an organization that sold racist t-shirts on their website and harassed anti-war groups. I was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and the ""intended loss"" in my case was arbitrarily calculated by multiplying the 5000 credit cards in Protest Warrior’s database by $500, resulting in a total of $2.5 million.My sentencing guidelines were calculated on the basis of this ""loss,"" even though not a single credit card was used or distributed – by me or anyone else. I was sentenced to two years in prison.

While in prison I have seen for myself the ugly reality of how the criminal justice system destroys the lives of the millions of people held captive behind bars. The experience solidified my opposition to repressive forms of power and the importance of standing up for what you believe.

When I was released, I was eager to continue my involvement in struggles for social change. I didn’t want to go back to prison, so I focused on above-ground community organizing. But over time, I became frustrated with the limitations, of peaceful protest, seeing it as reformist and ineffective. The Obama administration continued the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, escalated the use of drones, and failed to close Guantanamo Bay.

Around this time, I was following the work of groups like Wikileaks and Anonymous. It was very inspiring to see the ideas of hactivism coming to fruition. I was particularly moved by the heroic actions of Chelsea Manning, who had exposed the atrocities committed by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. She took an enormous personal risk to leak this information—believing that the public had a right to know and hoping that her disclosures would be a positive step to end these abuses. It is heart-wrenching to hear about her cruel treatment in military lockup.

I thought long and hard about choosing this path again. I had to ask myself, if Chelsea Manning fell into the abysmal nightmare of prison fighting for the truth, could I in good conscience do any less, if I was able? I thought the best way to demonstrate solidarity was to continue the work of exposing and confronting corruption.

I was drawn to Anonymous because I believe in autonomous, decentralized direct action. At the time Anonymous was involved in operations in support of the Arab Spring uprisings, against censorship, and in defense of Wikileaks. I had a lot to contribute, including technical skills, and how to better articulate ideas and goals. It was an exciting time – the birth of a digital dissent movement, where the definitions and capabilities of hacktivism were being shaped.

I was especially interested in the work of the hackers of LulzSec who were breaking into some significant targets and becoming increasingly political. Around this time, I first started talking to Sabu, who was very open about the hacks he supposedly committed, and was encouraging hackers to unite and attack major government and corporate systems under the banner of Anti Security. But very early in my involvement, the other Lulzsec hackers were arrested, leaving me to break into systems and write press releases. Later, I would learn that Sabu had been the first one arrested, and that the entire time I was talking to him he was an FBI informant.

Anonymous was also involved in the early stages of Occupy Wall Street. I was regularly participating on the streets as part of Occupy Chicago and was very excited to see a worldwide mass movement against the injustices of capitalism and racism. In several short months, the ""Occupations"" came to an end, closed by police crackdowns and mass arrests of protestors who were kicked out of their own public parks. The repression of Anonymous and the Occupy Movement set the tone for Antisec in the following months—the majority of our hacks against police targets were in retaliation for the arrests of our comrades.

I targeted law enforcement systems because of the racism and inequality with which the criminal law is enforced. I targeted the manufacturers and distributors of military and police equipment who profit from weaponry used to advance U.S. political and economic interests abroad and to repress people at home. I targeted information security firms because they work in secret to protect government and corporate interests at the expense of individual rights, undermining and discrediting activists, journalists and other truth seekers, and spreading disinformation.

I had never even heard of Stratfor until Sabu brought it to my attention. Sabu was encouraging people to invade systems, and helping to strategize and facilitate attacks. He even provided me with vulnerabilities of targets passed on by other hackers, so it came as a great surprise when I learned that Sabu had been working with the FBI the entire time.

On December 4, 2011, Sabu was approached by another hacker who had already broken into Stratfor’s credit card database. Sabu, under the watchful eye of his government handlers, then brought the hack to Antisec by inviting this hacker to our private chatroom, where he supplied download links to the full credit card database as well as the initial vulnerability access point to Stratfor’s systems.

I spent some time researching Stratfor and reviewing the information we were given, and decided that their activities and client base made them a deserving target. I did find it ironic that Stratfor’s wealthy and powerful customer base had their credit cards used to donate to humanitarian organizations, but my main role in the attack was to retrieve Stratfor’s private email spools which is where all the dirty secrets are typically found.

It took me more than a week to gain further access into Stratfor’s internal systems, but I eventually broke into their mail server. There was so much information, we needed several servers of our own in order to transfer the emails. Sabu, who was involved with the operation at every step, offered a server, which was provided and monitored by the FBI. Over the next weeks, the emails were transferred, the credit cards were used for donations, and Stratfor’s systems were defaced and destroyed. Why the FBI would introduce us to the hacker who found the initial vulnerability and allow this hack to continue remains a mystery.

As a result of the Stratfor hack, some of the dangers of the unregulated private intelligence industry are now known. It has been revealed through Wikileaks and other journalists around the world that Stratfor maintained a worldwide network of informants that they used to engage in intrusive and possibly illegal surveillance activities on behalf of large multinational corporations.

After Stratfor, I continued to break into other targets, using a powerful ""zero day exploit"" allowing me administrator access to systems running the popular Plesk webhosting platform. Sabu asked me many times for access to this exploit, which I refused to give him. Without his own independent access, Sabu continued to supply me with lists of vulnerable targets. I broke into numerous websites he supplied, uploaded the stolen email accounts and databases onto Sabu’s FBI server, and handed over passwords and backdoors that enabled Sabu (and, by extension, his FBI handlers) to control these targets.

These intrusions, all of which were suggested by Sabu while cooperating with the FBI, affected thousands of domain names and consisted largely of foreign government websites, including those of XXXXXX, XXXXXX, XXXX, XXXXXX, XXXXX, XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX and the XXXXXX XXXXXXX. In one instance, Sabu and I provided access information to hackers who went on to deface and destroy many government websites in XXXXXX. I don’t know how other information I provided to him may have been used, but I think the government’s collection and use of this data needs to be investigated.

The government celebrates my conviction and imprisonment, hoping that it will close the door on the full story. I took responsibility for my actions, by pleading guilty, but when will the government be made to answer for its crimes?

The U.S. hypes the threat of hackers in order to justify the multi billion dollar cyber security industrial complex, but it is also responsible for the same conduct it aggressively prosecutes and claims to work to prevent. The hypocrisy of ""law and order"" and the injustices caused by capitalism cannot be cured by institutional reform but through civil disobedience and direct action. Yes I broke the law, but I believe that sometimes laws must be broken in order to make room for change.

In the immortal word of Frederick Douglas, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.""

This is not to say that I do not have any regrets. I realize that I released the personal information of innocent people who had nothing to do with the operations of the institutions I targeted. I apologize for the release of data that was harmful to individuals and irrelevant to my goals. I believe in the individual right to privacy—from government surveillance, and from actors like myself, and I appreciate the irony of my own involvement in the trampling of these rights. I am committed to working to make this world a better place for all of us. I still believe in the importance of hactivism as a form of civil disobedience, but it is time for me to move on to other ways of seeking change. My time in prison has taken a toll on my family, friends, and community. I know I am needed at home. I recognize that 7 years ago I stood before a different federal judge, facing similar charges, but this does not lessen the sincerity of what I say to you today.

It has taken a lot for me to write this, to explain my actions, knowing that doing so—honestly—could cost me more years of my life in prison. I am aware that I could get as many as 10 years, but I hope that I do not, as I believe there is so much work to be done.

http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/8/18/bridge-to-nowheresyrianrefugeesingreece.html,Bridge to nowhere: Syrian refugees in Greece,"ATHENS – Daoud Abdo and his family entrusted their safety to Turkish traffickers they hoped would help them flee war-torn Syria for a new home in Europe.

The family of four spent two weeks on a bus from Istanbul to the Evros River, Europe’s southernmost land crossing. Abdo says he and his wife fell off a platform that crossed the river and into the marshes below.

Had it not been for Bangladeshi refugees who insisted the traffickers stop, Abdo says, he and his wife might have drowned.

But when the family reached Athens, they realized that the deal they’d struck back home in Aleppo -- paying the traffickers $24,000 for passage to Northern or Central Europe -- would not be honored without more money.

Together with a fast-growing number of Syrian refugees, the family was stuck in Greece, where they spent a year sleeping in city parks and on the streets.

Sometimes they were offered shelter, but only on the condition that they prostitute their daughter, Suzin, then 14.

For 48-year-old Abdo, once a well-to-do lawyer who worked for the Syrian government and owned property in Aleppo, it was a severe blow.

""I wish I had died there,” he says of his home in Syria. ""It would have been better and easier for me. The most difficult day for me in Greece was when we were homeless and all my children were crying because they were hungry and I couldn't feed them.""

Six months ago the Abdos were picked up off the street by Coptic Church members and put up in an apartment owned by the church, which also feeds them on a daily basis.

Abdo says his property has been mostly destroyed by the war in Syria, and he would never risk going back.

""There is no peaceful place left in Syria. Because we are Alevi, people hate us,” he says, referring to the minority tribe that, since President Bashar Assad's father became president in 1971, has controlled the nation of 22 million.

""Before, the hate was hidden,” he says. ""Now there is constant pressure from all the villages to leave.”

His wife's family has scattered to other countries. ""I will not send my children to their death,” she says when asked if the family would ever return.

Yet life in Greece remains difficult. While the war rages, Greek authorities do not deport Syrian refugees, but nor do they support them. Without residence permits, it is next to impossible for refugees to work legally. Many are reduced to begging. Others live off the charity of the Greek Orthodox Church and community organizations.

It is easy to be picked up during police stop-and-search operations targeting undocumented migrants. Syrians can end up in jail for months while their nationality is verified. Police brutality inside detention centers is frequent, as Juan Akash, a 35-year-old journalist, says he discovered.

Akash says that police picked him up with a group of Syrians who were trying to cross over to Italy from Greece's west coast at the beginning of the year. He was crammed into a cell with 56 others.

""We didn't sleep for three days,” Akash says. When police bused the inmates to other precincts, he says, ""the senior officers took me out and started to slap me on the face. Then police took out sticks and started to beat me. On the way down the stairs, they beat me behind the knees.”

Akash was taken to Korinth detention center, one of six facilities to house those awaiting deportation. ""It is not a human place,” Akash says of the former army camp, where he spent close to 50 days before being released.

During that time, he says he witnessed frequent beatings of Syrians and other nationals. An Afghan prisoner who refused food was beaten in full view of the others as an example, says Akash.",Q1
http://dawn.com/news/1060354/nato-seeks-clarity-on-troops-in-afghanistan,Nato seeks clarity on troops in Afghanistan,"BRUSSELS, Dec 3: World diplomats vexed over how to secure Afghanistan’s future used a looming year-end deadline on Tuesday to persuade the war-torn nation’s leaders that allowing thousands of foreign troops to remain there beyond next year is better than being left to protect the country alone.

The latest round of pressure on Afghan President Hamid Karzai puts the US and its Nato allies in the awkward political position of threatening to leave even as they make a strong case to stay.

It also heightens the possibility of a “zero option” — withdrawing all allied military forces from Afghanistan when the combat mission there ends at the end of 2014. The zero option gives the US and Nato nations an unintended advantage: It would allow them to refocus shrinking budgets on security risks elsewhere in the world as Al Qaeda’s threat in Afghanistan wanes. The dilemma in the war that President Barack Obama championed as a political candidate was a top topic at an annual forum of Nato ministers who will hear from two senior Afghan officials on Wednesday.

It was clear from Tuesday’s meeting that Nato, which has supplied military forces to Afghanistan since 2001, does not want to fully withdraw. A spokeswoman said ministers were in agreement that Kabul needs to sign the US security pact soon, in order to move forward with a similar plan to keep allied troops there.

In all, US and Nato could keep between 8,000 and 12,000 troops in Afghanistan beyond 2014. Of those, the US is expected to provide no more than 8,000 to train, equip and assist Afghan security forces.

Karzai has tentatively endorsed the deal, but he shocked allies last month when he refused to sign it after it was approved by a council of tribal elders known as the Loya Jirga. The council said the agreement with the US should be signed by the end of December, as Washington demands.—AP",Q1
http://www.opednews.com/articles/Hardliner-Mullah-Fazlullah-by-Abdus-Sattar-Ghaza-Afghanistan_Dialogue_Drone_FATA-131110-616.html,"Hardliner Mullah Fazlullah, Who Ordered Shooting of Malala, Chosen as New Pakistani Taliban Leader","



The Pakistani Taliban Thursday elected Mullah Fazlullah, a fiery cleric from Swat, to succeed Hakimullah Mehsud who was killed in a US drone attack on November 1. Sheikh Khalid Haqqani from Swabi was elected as his deputy by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

Alarmingly, the TTP leadership has been moved from the volatile tribal belt to the so-called settled districts of Pakistan. Mullah Fazlullah is the first leader not to come from the Mehsud or Wazir tribes -- which dominate the TTP -- or even the tribal areas - while Sheikh Khalid Haqqani is also from the settled region of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwah.

According to retired brigadier Mahmood Shah, a former secretary of FATA, Fazlullah's appointment had ""completely changed dynamics of the Pakistani Taliban. ""Fazlullah was ousted from Swat valley, his hometown, and he is living in Afghanistan. He is wanted by Pakistan, so can he run the organization smoothly from other side of the Durand Line (border with Afghanistan)?"" Shah said.

Mullah Fazlullah led the Taliban's two year rule in Pakistan's northwest valley of Swat in 2007-2009 before a military operation retook the area. Since the operation in Swat, Fazlullah took shelter in Afghanistan.

Pakistan says Fazlullah has directed attacks on its soil from across the border. His men were blamed for beheading 17 Pakistani soldiers in a check post attack in June 2012. He is also said to be involved in the high profile killing of Major General (retd) Sanaullah Khan Niazi, General Officer Commanding Swat, in Upper Dir in an IED blast, in September 2013. However, the Pakistan Current Affairs reported that a Powerful Country was behind the death of Major General Sanaullah Niazi, to sabotage the peace process between the government of Pakistan and the Taliban. ""This Powerful country does not want the peace talk so the country kept an eye on the movement of Major General Sanaullah Khan Niazi via Satellite and informed militant groups in Pakistan about his movements,"" the Pakistan Current Affairs said .

The choice of Fazlullah by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ruling council appears to have sunk government plans for peace talks to try to end the six-year bloody insurgency. Mehsud and his allies had been tentatively open to the concept of ceasefire talks with the government, but Fazlullah's emergence as the new chief changes that picture.

TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said the new leader was against peace talks. ""Holding of peace talks is not even an issue to discuss - this government has no authority, it is not a sovereign government, it is a slave, a slave of America. Holding peace talks is a waste of time,"" Shahid told AFP.

""There will be no more talks as Mullah Fazlullah is already against negotiations with the Pakistan government,"" spokesman Shahidullah told Reuters. ""All governments play double games with us. In the name of peace talks, they deceived us and killed our people. We are one hundred percent sure that Pakistan fully supports the United States in its drone strikes.""

The killing of Mullah Fazlullah's predecessor, Hakimullah Mehsud came as government representatives prepared to meet the TTP with a view to opening peace talks.

The failure of both drone strikes and Pakistani military operations in the FATA tribal areas to stem the tide of terrorism had led to a decision by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to try a political dialogue with the Taliban. But the drone strike that killed Mehsud stopped the peace talks before they could begin.

According to Gareth Porter of Inter Press Service, the CIA had an institutional grudge to settle with Mehsud after he had circulated a video with Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the Jordanian suicide bomber who had talked the CIA into inviting him to its compound at Camp Chapman in Khost province, where he killed seven CIA officials and contractors on Dec. 30, 2009.

The CIA had already carried out at least two drone strikes aimed at killing Mehsud in January 2010 and January 2012.

The killing of Hakimullah Mehsud and election of Mullah Fazlullah would certainly trigger another round of retaliatory TTP suicide bombings in Pakistan's largest cities.",Q1
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/wallin-audit-says-senator-billed-travel-expenses-during-2011-election/article13727302/?cmpid=rss1,Wallin audit referred to RCMP as new expense details emerge,"Senator Pamela Wallin waits for the start of a committee meeting examining an audit of her expenses on Parliament Hill on Aug. 12, 2013.CHRIS WATTIE/Reuters Share

The release of a detailed audit of Pamela Wallin's expense claims is deepening political problems for the Harper government, with the Saskatchewan senator accused of billing more than $121,000 in questionable expenses since taking office.

The Senate committee that ordered the independent audit confirmed Tuesday that it would refer the matter to the RCMP as it unveiled a report that listed dozens of travel claims Ms. Wallin made to the Senate for trips auditors said were related to personal and partisan events.

Ms. Wallin's Conservative Party-related events, in particular, add to the government's difficulties as it tries to gain control of a growing sense of public mistrust with the way the Red Chamber works. Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to address the Senate spending issue in a Speech from the Throne when Parliament returns, a sign that he hopes to calm the nerves of aggrieved party supporters frustrated by the recent spending revelations.

At the same time, some senators are raising questions about how much weight should be placed on an individual's qualifications and ability to contribute to public policy when they are appointed, according to a Conservative senator who asked not to be named.

Both Liberal and Conservative governments have used Senate appointments to reward party supporters, a strategy the senator acknowledged may not always produce the best policy makers.

Ms. Wallin and embattled Senator Mike Duffy – who was given $90,000 by Mr. Harper's then-chief of staff to repay improper expenses this year – are not long-time members of the Conservative Party. But the two former TV journalists brought an element of star power that they leveraged to become key party fundraisers and spokespeople once they entered the Senate.

The audit released Tuesday indicates that Ms. Wallin told auditors she was asked to be a ""different kind of Senator,"" who was more active in the community and in representing the Red Chamber. She said she spoke with another Conservative senator about some of her roles outside the Senate, such as her earlier position as chancellor at the University of Guelph, and confirmed that related travel expenses could be reimbursed.

Ms. Wallin was ordered Tuesday to return $82,979 in improper claims, in addition to the $38,369 she has already repaid. Several of the claims identified by auditors are for travel to party-related speaking engagements, while others involve trips Ms. Wallin made to Toronto or stops in that city while she was en route to Saskatchewan.

Despite a reminder that was issued to all senators shortly before the 2011 federal election period, Ms. Wallin billed the Senate for three events related to partisan election activities in April of that year, including a rally in support of the Conservative Party in Saskatoon two weeks before the election.

An internal document distributed to senators shortly before that election notes that their campaign expenses must be authorized in advance by the candidate's official agent and paid for by that campaign.

Officials in the Prime Minister's Office and at Conservative Party headquarters did not respond to requests for information about who authorized Ms. Wallin to travel for partisan events, and about when the government and the party became aware that the senator had billed the Red Chamber for related expenses.

""No,"" Andrew MacDougall, Mr. Harper's director of communications, replied by e-mail, when asked whether the government knew of or approved charging expenses for party-related events to the Senate.

""Our Government will not tolerate the waste or abuse of taxpayer money,"" he wrote. ""We expect that any inappropriate expenses will be repaid.""

Fred DeLorey, spokesman for the Conservative Party, responded to a similar question and a request for an interview with this statement by e-mail: ""These expenses were submitted by Senator Wallin. Questions about them should be addressed to her.""

Ms. Wallin has called the audit ""flawed and fundamentally unfair,"" but promised Monday to repay whatever money the Senate says she owes with interest. She could not be reached for comment after the audit was made public Tuesday.

NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus, whose party wants to abolish the Senate, said the audit raises new questions about whether other members of the Red Chamber have used Senate resources to pay for political campaign work. ""It really raises the question, is it believable that she was the only one misusing the system in this way,"" he said.

-DR. ABDUL RUFF COLACHAL

_______________

None is above law and everyone, both ruled and rulers, should face the consequences of his actions, especially the crimes committed against humanity.

A Pakistani special treason tribunal has issued an arrest warrant for the former US-backed military strongman Pervez Musharraf, who is on trial for treason over his imposition of a state of emergency in 2007. The court also refused to allow him to travel abroad for medical treatment for a heart condition that he complained of suffering while travelling to the tribunal on January 2.

In 2007, after suspending the constitution and declaring emergency rule, Musharraf ordered the military to occupy the parliament and the Supreme Court, take private television stations off the air and jail political opponents. Several judges, including the country’s chief justice, were sacked. If convicted of treason, Musharraf could face the death penalty.

Musharraf was summoned to appear before the tribunal on December 24, but has yet to attend the court due to security and health concerns. The protracted process of beginning the trial points to sharp divisions in Pakistani ruling circles, including the military, over the charges.

A strong US ally, Musharraf has been granted bail in these cases, and is eligible to be bailed on the latest arrest warrant. The court yesterday, however, insisted it did not have the power to take Musharraf off an “exit control list” preventing him from leaving the country.

By allowing the US forces to enter Afghanistan through Pakistan, aiming at destabilization of both these nations, besides many more nations, the former Pakistani president had been responsible for the ongoing terror wars perpetrated by NATO in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Bush administration relied heavily on Musharraf to facilitate the 2001 US-led invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Pakistan’s withdrawal of support for the Taliban government, which it had helped install, was critical to the Taliban’s rapid overthrow. The Musharraf regime also provided supply routes for US forces in Afghanistan and helped track down “terrorist” targets.

Musharraf seized power in a military coup in 1999, ousting Nawaz Sharif, who is once again the prime minister today. Following the 1999 coup, the military tried and convicted Sharif of “kidnapping, attempted murder, hijacking and terrorism and corruption.” He was only allowed to go into exile after an intervention by Saudi Arabia.

Musharraf ruled until early 2008 when the PPP led by Zardari won the parliamentary poll, pushing for Musharraf’s exit. . His exit was arranged by the US in alliance with Saudi and UAE. Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who had returned to Pakistan, was assassinated in December 2007 while campaigning for national and regional assembly elections.

Musharraf returned from self-exile last year in a bid to contest the election last May, which was won by Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League (Narwaz) (PML-N). The new government hesitated for months before filing treason charges.

Musharraf, who had asked the military to attack the Red Mosque in Islamabad, killing the Imam, among others inside, also faces other charges, including for the murder of Bhutto and a military assault in August 2006 that killed Balochi nationalist leader Nawab Akbar Bugti.

Musharraf has denounced the case against him as a “political vendetta.” When the hearing began in December, he warned: “When you’re doing wrong against an army chief, you’re causing disturbances with the military ranks.” He claimed that the army was “totally with me on this issue.”

Speaking in parliament last June, Sharif declared: “Musharraf has to answer for his misdeeds.” His comments were no doubt pitched at deep hostility to the former dictator, both within the PML-N and more broadly.

Sharif, however, has already indicated that there will be no broader probe into the military under Musharraf’s rule. The military has been central to propping up corporate rule in Pakistan and has ruled the country for more than half of its existence. Having been a victim of military action, Sharif is acutely aware that he cannot afford to alienate the army.

The military, which Musharraf acknowledged tried to dissuade him from returning to take part in last year’s election, has been largely silent on the trial. However, the fact that Musharraf is being treated at a military facility, which recommended he be sent abroad, indicates that the army would prefer that no trial took place.

Moreover, facing growing opposition, the government enacted the Pakistan Protection Ordinance last month, granting extraordinary powers to the security forces. The military might defy the civilian authorities to protect Musharraf.

Musharraf has appealed to the United Nations, as well as the US, UK and Saudi Arabia, to intervene, saying he would not receive a fair trial in Pakistan. But the Obama regime has washed its hands of Musharraf, saying his trial was an “internal matter.”

Sharif is just as committed to the US and its occupation of Afghanistan as Musharraf was. The current government has turned a blind eye to the CIA’s drone war in Pakistani border areas with Afghanistan that has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, and has given the green light for air attacks in Pakistan’s North Waziristan region.

The Sharif government is confronting a deepening dilemma over Musharraf’s trial. Having raised public expectations that the ex-dictator will face justice, it cannot readily ditch the prosecution. At the same time, the government faces resistance from the military that is clearly concerned that the trial could expose its involvement in Musharraf’s crimes and open the way for broader prosecutions.

The Sharif government is heavily dependent on US military aid, as well as loans from international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

Pakistani elite seeks regular free trips to USA and they consider themselves fellow travelers with Musharraf in defending the NATO crimes, supporting the US attacks on Pakistanis, looting Pakistani resources for personal causes.

Musharraf must answer the blood of millions of innocent Muslims, branded by CIA as terrorists and insurgents.

If Musharraf is left free by the judiciary, hopefully he won’t be, the strong message would be sent to the world that the rulers can commit any number of crimes.

Fake democracy or falsified Islam is one thing in Pakistan, but committing crimes by rulers against people just by misusing the thumping powers should be addressed properly now.

The question often asked, when Amanda Lindhout disappeared in one of the world's nastiest war zones, was: Why?

Nobody instructed the young journalist to visit Somalia in the middle of a civil war. No editors demanded her coverage; her only steady job when she landed in Mogadishu was a regular column for the Red Deer Advocate, a small newspaper in central Alberta. When news broke that a 27-year-old freelancer had been kidnapped, some veteran correspondents asked each other why the rookie threw herself into such danger.

We get a satisfying answer in Ms. Lindhout's new book, A House In The Sky, crafted with help from the talented Sara Corbett, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. The early chapters describe the way Ms. Lindhout was seduced by the world, drawn to faraway places never imagined in her rural hometown. Inspired at first by the glossy pages of National Geographic magazine, she followed the usual backpacking routes in Latin American and South Asia, then strayed far beyond the maps in her tourist books. Rough spots along the way – getting mugged at gunpoint in Kabul, falling sick in the deserts of Ethiopia – only deepened the allure.

She wanted to break into journalism, but it's a hard business. The Advocate paid $35 per article. She got hired for the Baghdad bureau of Press TV, Iran's state broadcaster, but grew tired of the spin from Tehran. She saw the neglected war in Somalia as an opportunity, remembering the way famed newscaster Dan Rather had proved his mettle while covering a hurricane as a young reporter in the 1960s. ""Because he was there, because he'd taken the risk, he managed to tell the story in a vivid and meaningful way. His career was made,"" she wrote, adding later: ""Somalia, I thought, could be my hurricane.""

That's crazy, to some people, but I recognized some of my own craziness in her story. Like her, I grew up in a small Canadian town, and I was only 26 years old when I launched myself into the battlefields of Afghanistan as a correspondent for this newspaper.

What lures us into dangerous places? Ambition, curiosity, desire for meaningful work. Youthful stupidity. The romance of new landscapes. The yearning to make our lives useful, adding a human voice to the cold politics that govern the fates of millions.

All of these things are part of Ms. Lindhout's explanation of the way she stumbled into Somalia, and they're achingly familiar. I live in Kabul, where most of my friends tick with the same emotional clockwork. Many of us live as ordinary civilians but with the backing of a major organizations that provide risk insurance and medical training. But there's a growing cadre of people like Ms. Lindhout, scraping by with only meagre savings and strong instincts. Such freelancers are now carrying much of the burden for coverage of Libya, Syria, and other wars.

This is the reality of our age, with news organizations and Western governments stricken by shrinking budgets. Young adventurers are filling the gaps in our understanding about the worst places, often with little backup when bad things happen.

The details of the bad things suffered by Ms. Lindhout and her travelling companion make for exceptionally grim chapters. Kidnappers grabbed them on their fourth day in Somalia, and their odyssey lasted more than 15 months. She was beaten, tortured and raped. She briefly contemplated suicide. In the end, their families raised $1.2-million and bought their freedom.

It's painful reading, but readers will probably find inspiration in her ability to endure hardship. The book should also be mandatory for anybody who feels compelled to work in the toughest parts of the world. No matter what precautions are taken, the most important distinction between Ms. Lindhout and the rest of us, unfortunately, is luck. In the same hour that I finished writing this review, I heard news about two foreign aid workers kidnapped in Afghanistan. They were travelling a road we all assumed to be safe.

The most frightening part of Ms. Lindhout's account is that such ordeals will be repeated – and continue, even now, in the difficult corners of the world that attract young idealists.

http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/01/afghan_us_forces_tar_1.php,"Afghan, US forces target Haqqani-linked Taliban leader in Parwan","Coalition and Afghan special operations forces targeted a Haqqani Network-linked Taliban leader during a recent raid in the central Afghan province in Parwan. The Taliban commander, who serves as Parwan’s deputy shadow governor, “transports weapons, fighters and suicide bombers” into the province and Kabul. Afghanistan’s president accused the US of killing eight civilians during the raid.

Ten Taliban fighters, a US Special Forces soldier, and two civilians were killed after Afghan commandos and Coalition advisers launched a raid on Jan. 15 “to disrupt insurgent activities in the [Ghorband] district, including attacks on Bagram Airfield,” the International Security Assistance Force stated in a press release.

ISAF said that the combined special operations force “came under heavy fire from insurgents, resulting in the death of one ISAF service member.” The two civilians were killed after the Afghan and Coalition force launched airstrikes on nearby buildings that were occupied by Taliban fighters.

President Karzai claimed that a woman and seven children were killed during the fighting, and again called for an end to the controversial ‘night raids’ by Coalition forces.

“The Afghan government has been asking for a complete end to operations in Afghan villages for years, but American forces acting against all mutual agreements … have once again bombarded a residential area and killed civilians,” a statement from Karzai’s office said. The statement neglected to note that Afghan commandos led the operation.

ISAF indicated that areas of Parwan province remain under the Taliban’s control or influence.

“The operation was conducted in a high threat area with Taliban activity, some linked to the Haqqani Network,” ISAF said. “The insurgents in this area enjoy freedom of movement allowing them to harass and threaten the local population as well as stage and facilitate attacks.”

The primary target of the operation was Qari Nazar Gul, the deputy shadow governor, who also is “a member of the senior Taliban Commission.”

“Gul has ties to the Haqqani Network and transports weapons, fighters and suicide bombers to Parwan and Kabul,” ISAF said. He also “has conducted attacks against ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] and Coalition forces including a complex attack at Bagram Airfield.” ISAF may be referring to the May 19, 2010 suicide assault on Bagram Airbase that was executed by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, al Qaeda, and the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. The assault was led by Bekay Harrach, a dual-hatted IMU and al Qaeda leader from Germany. Harrach is thought to have been killed during the attack.

Background on the Haqqani Network

The Haqqani Network is a powerful Taliban subgroup that operates primarily in the Afghan provinces of Khost, Paktia, and Paktika, but also has an extensive presence in Kabul, Parwan, Logar, Wardak, Ghazni, Zabul, Kandahar, Baghlan, Kunduz, and Takhar. In addition, the network has expanded its operations into the distant Afghan provinces of Badakhshan, Faryab, and Kunar, according to ISAF press releases that document raids against the network. In central Afghanistan, the Haqqani Network coordinates suicide operations and complex assaults with groups such as the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, al Qaeda, Hizb-i-Islami Gulbuddin, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, in what ISAF used to call the Kabul Attack Network.

The Haqqani Network has close links with al Qaeda, and its relationship with Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISID) has allowed the network to survive and thrive in its fortress stronghold of North Waziristan. The terror group has also extended its presence into the Pakistani tribal agency of Kurram.

In North Waziristan, the Haqqanis control large swaths of the tribal area and run a parallel administration with courts, recruiting centers, tax offices, and security forces. In addition, the Haqqanis have established multiple training camps and safe houses that are used by al Qaeda leaders and operatives and by Taliban foot soldiers preparing to fight in Afghanistan.

The Haqqani Network has been implicated in some of the biggest terror attacks in the Afghan capital city of Kabul, including the January 2008 suicide assault on the Serena hotel, the February 2009 assault on Afghan ministries, and the July 2008 and October 2009 suicide attacks against the Indian embassy.

The terror group collaborated with elements of Pakistan’s military and intelligence service in at least one of these attacks. American intelligence agencies have confronted the Pakistani government with evidence, including communications intercepts, which proved the ISID’s direct involvement in the 2008 Indian Embassy bombing. [See LWJ report Pakistan’s Jihad and Threat Matrix report Pakistan backs Afghan Taliban for additional information on the ISID’s complicity in attacks in Afghanistan and the region.]

In the summer and fall of 2011, the US and the Afghan government linked the Haqqani Network and Pakistan’s intelligence service to the June 28, 2011 assault on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and the Sept. 13, 2011 attack on the US Embassy and ISAF headquarters. Shortly after the September attack, Admiral Michael Mullen, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accused the Haqqani Network of being one of several “[e]xtremist organizations serving as proxies of the government of Pakistan.”

The US military has been hunting top Haqqani Network commanders in special operations raids in the Afghan east, while the CIA has targeted the network with a series of unmanned Predator airstrikes in Pakistan’s tribal agency of North Waziristan. In November, the CIA killed Maulvi Ahmed Jan, a top deputy to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the group’s operational commander, in a strike in the district of Hangu.

Despite the targeting of top Haqqani Network leaders, the group continues to expand in Afghanistan.

Nicholas Ingham arrived at this massive air base, in the belly of an Air Force C-130. As the back door swung open, flooding the cabin with light, the heavily sedated Marine, strapped onto a stretcher, blinked away a tear. An American flag tattooed on his chest rose and fell gently as a ventilator pumped air into his collapsed lung.

A team of doctors, nurses and medical technicians assigned to the trauma center here gently offloaded Ingham and a handful of other injured troops with mechanical precision, the first stop on their journey home.

It would be the same journey thousands of wounded warriors had made before them.

These days, 12 years after the start of America's longest war, far fewer U.S. troops are being killed or wounded in Afghanistan. The military's drawdown has picked up pace, and Afghans have begun to shoulder the brunt of the fighting. But the war continues to churn out American casualties by the dozen each week. Their injuries rarely make headlines.

Still, military health-care experts say those wounded in battle are coming home more severely injured than at any time since 2006, a sobering sign of the strength of the insurgency at the twilight of the war. Many of the injured arrive on the medical evacuation flights that land twice a week at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland physically intact but mentally wrecked, struggling with the demons of multiple deployments over the past decade.

Their caretakers, part of a massive wartime medical evacuation system that is being wound down, have a rare and often grim vantage on the final chapter of the Afghan war — a conflict that is increasingly being endured, rather than fought, largely out of sight.

“Are you feeling any pain?” Maj. Scott A. Zakaluzny, a surgeon at Bagram’s hospital, asked Ingham as his colleagues inspected the gashes torn into his back, arms and legs by shrapnel from a suicide bombing. Looking miserable, Ingham, 27, opened his eyes slightly and shook his head.

Out of mind

In Washington, among policymakers, the Afghan war is increasingly discussed with exasperation, like a curse. It is the type of warfare the United States must avoid at all cost, President Obama argued during his State of the Union address.

“We must fight the battles that need to be fought,” Obama told those in attendance, among them a soldier disfigured by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. “Not those that terrorists prefer from us — large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.”

Also in the House chamber that night was Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a former Air Force pilot who flew intelligence and medevac missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“I think there is a sense in the military that Americans are not paying attention anymore,” he had told a reporter a few weeks earlier, shortly after returning from a visit to Kabul. “I think they’re right, to be honest. There is a sense that it’s over, but it’s not.”

There are roughly 33,700 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in the spring of 2011.

Those who have been wounded here have had a better chance at survival than in any previous U.S. war — a result of stunning achievements in battlefield care. But in some ways, combat medics say, the work in Afghanistan has become more challenging. The injury severity score, a measure that takes into account the extent of a patient's wounds, has gone up gradually in Afghanistan since 2006, according to data compiled by the military.

Col. Kirby Gross, a physician who studies trauma care for wounded troops and who is deployed at Bagram, struggled to find the right words to explain how insurgents have become so proficient at killing and maiming American service members.

“They’re nimble,” was as much of a compliment as he was willing to pay.

Medical professionals say the combat evacuation system that sprang up at the height of the Iraq war to care for the wounded is being pared down. In December, Bagram became the only base in Afghanistan with a top-tier trauma center, which means that patients across the battlefield in need of specialized care face longer journeys. As the footprint becomes smaller in coming months, the margin of error will widen, said Lt. Col. Mary Danko, the chief Air Force flight nurse in Bagram.

“Right now, it’s a great process we have,” she said. “But you worry about the one life you won’t be able to save because of the lack of resources.”

At the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, the three miles of hallways that were once brimming with war victims are now largely empty. Air Force Lt. Col. David Zonies, the chief of trauma and critical care at Landstuhl, expressed longer-term concerns on this morning, noting that when his tour was up, he wouldn’t be replaced.

“There’s a very serious concern that we will potentially not learn the lessons of this war for the next one,” he said. “After Korea and Vietnam, the money ran out, the resources ran out, skills started to wane. Are we going to make the same mistake after this conflict?”

‘I felt my lung bubbling’

Ingham had deployed twice before to Afghanistan during periods when U.S. troops battled insurgents every day. His last wartime assignment was to lead a group of Georgian soldiers tasked with preventing militants from firing rockets into a sprawling NATO base in Helmand province, in southwestern Afghanistan.

Early in the afternoon of Dec. 14, a lone driver in a blue sedan steered his vehicle toward a patrol he was leading. The Georgian soldiers appeared edgy, and Ingham worried that if they overreacted, he could have a civilian casualty incident on his watch. So he walked toward the driver, alone, hoping to wave him off.

“Civilian casualties in Afghanistan are a particularly touchy subject,” he would say later. “I was trying to prevent something that could have turned into a very bad event.”

As Ingham moved toward the car, the driver pressed on toward him. The lanky captain raised his rifle in a final effort to get him to back off. By then, he was close enough to hear the man at the wheel utter “Allahu akbar,” or “God is great,” words that could have meant only one thing in that context. Ingham opened fire, pumping 18 bullets into the driver, whose vehicle continued to inch toward him.

“I turned around and got a step and a half and it exploded,” Ingham said, comparing the fury of the blast to a massive wave that thrusts you from behind. The explosion sent the car’s engine flying 100 meters and dug out a massive crater in the ground. As he limped away from the plume of smoke toward his men, Ingham took a breath and realized he had been badly hurt.

“I felt my lung bubbling,” he said, recounting the attack and its aftermath weeks later at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda. “I knew something had gone through my chest.”

‘They think the war’s over’

Ingham’s doctors expect he will make a full recovery and could soon lead Marines in combat again. But as he spoke on this morning, he was surrounded by service members who won’t. One, Lance Cpl. Paul Shupert, who had been deployed in the same province as Ingham, had arrived at Walter Reed a few weeks before, missing part of his right leg.

“It’s a shame you guys are coming home hurt,” Ingham told the 22-year-old Marine, shaking his head.

“We know what we signed up for,” Shupert replied quietly, his legs draped by a heavy black blanket with leopard-print edges.

There was no sense talking Shupert out of following in his father’s footsteps when, at 17, he persuaded his parents in Jefferson City, Tenn., to sign a waiver allowing him to join the Marines. When he deployed to Afghanistan for the first time last summer, his mother was paralyzed by fear.

“Everyone was thinking I was taking it too hard,” Tonya Shupert said. “They think the war’s over.”

Tonya Shupert is nothing if not a patriot, often donning “Marine Corps Mom” T-shirts. But like many in military families, she struggled to understand why men such as her son were still being sent to Afghanistan.

“I think there are some things we shouldn’t be involved in,” she said one evening while doing laundry at the patient living quarters. “Some of those people have been fighting for years and years, and us going there is not going to change that.”

The war changed her son permanently the afternoon of Nov. 25, after he had volunteered to help explosive ordnance disposal experts search a compound. Shupert had carefully followed the footsteps of the Marine in front of him, mindful that the compound could be surrounded by land mines.

“I guess I must have missed a spot,” he would say later. “I did back flips through the air and remember landing on my back and looking at my legs. My pants were blown off, and I saw it had taken off the foot.”

Shupert has not allowed himself a moment of self-pity since that day, arguing that dwelling on his loss will not make the limb grow back. When he first saw his family at Walter Reed after being evacuated, they were comforted that he had not lost his sense of humor. The ordeal was a perfect excuse for a new tattoo, Shupert told them. He would ink the words “Part A” on his thigh and label his prosthetic leg “Part B.”

Keeping a record

After each flight arrives at Andrews, Army Col. Michael J. Worth writes a report with tiny narratives about each wounded warrior he has debriefed.

Advertisement

A few are bizarre, for instance the ordeal of a female lieutenant nurse who was accidentally shot in the foot by her boss.

“She doesn’t know precisely what her boss was doing to cause the discharge,” wrote Worth, who is tasked with making sure patients get to the right final destination for additional care.

Some of the narratives are haunting. Only after failing to get a young soldier to talk after one flight did Worth realize that the Army Ranger had sustained serious wounds to his genitals.

But it is perhaps the mental wounds that trouble the colonel the most. He had recently welcomed home an Army couple. The wife, a staff sergeant assigned to a transportation unit who had been deployed seven times, had shot herself in the abdomen in an apparent suicide attempt. Her husband was relieved to be home but ashen as he escorted his unconscious spouse off the plane.

Like most military officers, Worth tries to focus on the mission and not dwell on the politics of war.

“We execute the lawful orders of the president,” he said. “What I see on the airplane is a consequence of that, and I’m here to help them and deal with them. Any thoughts I have as a private citizen will have to wait until I leave.”

And so there was stoic silence among the military personnel awaiting Shupert’s flight on a cold, windy evening in early December. As the plane turned on its landing lights and tipped its nose down, it was commanded to turn back skyward and circle overhead for more than 30 minutes. Vice President Biden’s team was ready to take off for a trip to Asia, so authorities at Andrews froze all other movement on the airfield.",Q1

By Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai, in a meeting with U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice, proposed new terms for a deal governing troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and said he is in no hurry to sign the accord, the White House said on Monday. ""President Karzai outlined new conditions for signing the agreement and indicated he is not prepared to sign the BSA promptly,"" the White House said in a readout of the meeting between the two officials. Karzai has persistently raised questions about the pact, which would enable U.S. troops to operate in the country beyond next year. An assembly of Afghan elders on Sunday endorsed the deal and advised Karzai to sign it promptly. However, the Afghan president said he would not sign it until after a presidential election due in April. There should be peace in Afghanistan before the deal is signed, he said. In Kabul, Karzai's spokesman said the Afghan president wanted to the United States to halt all military operations on civilians' homes and return Afghan citizens held in the Guantanamo prison camp before the pact is signed. Rice, who made a three-day visit to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops, told Karzai it is ""not viable"" to defer signing the deal until after the election, the White House said. ""It would not provide the United States and NATO allies the clarity necessary to plan for a potential post-2014 military presence,"" she said. ""Without a prompt signature, the U.S. would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan,"" she added.

Speed is of the essence as US forces are slated to pull out. Fresh negotiations must be struck with emphasis on their new roles and responsibilities as a complete withdrawal of forces will leave Afghanistan’s security apparatus in a deadly vacuum and vulnerable against the Taliban.

Back in the days of the Taliban, Afghanistan’s media landscape was barren: television sets were banned, radio stations were not allowed to play music and newspapers were forbidden from printing pictures.

But since 2001, the country’s media sector has been revolutionised. Today, there are more than 400 news outlets.

Saad Mohseni, the chairperson of the Moby Media Group says: “Western governments and institutions realised early on that media could play a significant role in terms of facilitating social change in this country and also to open up the world to Afghans.The media informs, it entertains, to a large extent it allows people to let off steam. People can hold institutions and individuals accountable …. It plays the role of many things in a country like this. Western governments may have made a lot of mistakes, helping the media has been one of the big success stories.”

The explosive growth in media has been largely bankrolled by the West, primarily the US. But with western troops preparing to leave in 2014, international funding for the media will soon be drying up.

http://www.dw.de/pakistan-still-complacent-five-years-after-26-11/a-17251131,Facing facts – DW – 11,"Five years ago, a militant group from Pakistan unleashed havoc on the Indian financial hub of Mumbai, killing over 160 people in over two days of terror. Pakistan continues to refuse to confront the issue.

The evening of November 26, 2008 starts like any other in the Indian financial hub of Mumbai. Hundreds of thousands of commuters are on their way home; hotels and restaurants in the south of the city center are filled with people from the city and from all over the world.

And then it happens - the moment ""26/11"" becomes etched into India's collective memory: without warning, Islamist terrorists create a bloodbath, opening fire on crowds of people using automatic weapons, bombs and hand grenades. Their targets include anyone who appears to be a Jew, American or British national. They take hostages in hotels and shops; a Jewish establishment is stormed.

Indian media do not hold back from showing live pictures of the havoc and death being wrought upon the city. The images are broadcast around the world. Fighting between the terrorists and security forces lasts two days. At the end of the ordeal, on November 29, nine terrorists are dead. One of the perpetrators, the Pakistani national Ajmal Kasab, is overpowered and taken into police custody. In the incident, 166 people, mostly Indians, lost their lives. According to Amnesty International, around 300 people were injured.

'War against India'

In September 2009 seven suspects were taken to an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan for their alleged involvement in the attack. But the legal proceedings have been sluggish, as Pakistan accuses India of failing to bring forward substantial evidence against the men. India, in turn, accuses Pakistan of deliberately protracting the proceedings. The seven defendants are set to approach the Islamabad High Court for their release on bail, according to media reports.

The United States has offered a USD 10 million bounty for Hafiz Saeed, the leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba Image: AP

In 2013, US citizen David Coleman Headley was sentenced to 35 years by a US federal court in Chicago, Illinois, for helping plot the attacks. Kasab was indicted in India and put on trial for ""waging war against India."" He was sentenced to death and hanged in November 2012.

Five years after the attacks, investigators in India and the US have come a long way in getting behind the motives, thanks to confessions by Headley and Kasab. Both of the confessions blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba, an Islamist organization which operates from Lahore, Pakistan, and which has close ties to the Pakistani military secret service Inter-Services Intelligence, and which has for many years been carrying out attacks in Indian Kashmir as a non-state actor. The group was declared a terrorist organization as early as 2001 by the US.

No interest in investigations

Pakistan has so far failed to help with the investigations. Arshad Mahmood, a Pakistani historian, tells DW that Islamabad 's claims that New Delhi hasn't brought forward any hard evidence against the suspects are baseless. ""Pakistan clearly doesn't want any investigation linking it to the attacks. This would be a humiliation.""

But, according to Toqeer Gilani, a political activist in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, there is more behind Islamabad's refusal to cooperate than just an attempt to keep face. ""I am convinced that Islamic organizations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba are supported by Pakistani intelligence agencies. Taking action against the group would be like attacking the components of the state,"" he said.

The only gunman to survive the attack, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, was tried in Mumbai and hanged late last year Image: dapd

Five years on, the dialogue process between the two countries is still sluggish. Vinod Sharma, a journalist working for the Indian newspaper Hindustan Times, views the events of November 26, 2008 as a massive setback. ""And the mistrust became even greater, as it became clear that Pakistan wouldn't bring those behind the attack to justice."" This view is shared by Mahmood, who says it will be very difficult for India to overcome the trauma of Mumbai as long as Pakistan doesn't take action against those responsible. ""And this is not to be expected,"" he adds.

A difficult dialogue

Sharma is of the opinion that the media in both countries bear some responsibility for the stalemate between the nuclear neighbors. He says it has become common practice in India to attack Pakistan and vice versa. ""It helps nobody. Politics must be based on dialogue, but this is something that is ignored by the media in both nations,"" the journalist criticizes.

However, Sharma remains optimistic about the future of bilateral relations. He argues that Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came into office on the promise of normalizing ties with India, something viewed positively by Indians. ""We believe that Sharif's election has been the best opportunity in a long time to improve Indo-Pakistani ties. But a lot depends on whether Sharif will be able to assert himself."" Analysts suspect, however, this could be difficult, as extremists can even count on support from members of the Muslim League, Sharif's party.

But the improvement of relations also depends on India, which is set to hold parliamentary elections next spring. It remains to be seen, however, whether this will lead to better relations with Pakistan. Polls put the India's ruling Congress party behind the Hindu nationalists of the BJP.

Background Briefing: Senior State Department Officials and Senior Administration Official on Bilateral Security Agreement

Special Briefing

ERT London, England

October 12, 2013

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Okay. So we're just going to do a quick backgrounder on the meetings that Secretary Kerry just had in Afghanistan, and a readout of those. And we have Senior State Department Official One, Senior Administration Official One here. And if I have anything, I'll be Number Two.

So, I think we'll do an overview first, and then do some questions, if that works.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: So the visit, obviously, was focused on the Bilateral Security Agreement. It comes 11-ish months into the negotiations. It was generally productive. From our vantage, positive in that we reached a basic agreement on all of the key issues.

The President – when President Karzai visited Washington last January, the President announced our objectives for a post-2014 presence as being, first, a train, advise, and assist mission under NATO leadership, and then also a CT mission, by which --

QUESTION: Train, advise, and what?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Train, advise, and assist mission.

QUESTION: Assist.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: And also a counter-terrorism mission, by which we could pursue the remnants of al-Qaida.

And the language of the agreement as it stands right now provides what we need for both of those missions. And, more importantly, as with every status of forces agreement worldwide, the language also provides what we need in terms of assurances and guarantees for rights of self-defense, for force protection, and the jurisdiction issues that are obviously so important to us.

So, overall, the text, we believe, is in a good place. And I think we stayed a little bit longer than we had hoped, but I think it was worth it in that we were able to come to that basic agreement.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Why don't we do some questions?

QUESTION: Before we get into the – what the Secretary was talking about – strike that. (Laughter.) Before we get into the area that is not – that still is awaiting – the most contentious issue, the jurisdictional issue, can you explain to us what exactly the – has been agreed, in terms of the counterterrorism stuff and in terms of sovereignty? Like, Karzai made a big deal out of the definition of ""invasion"" and the definition of ""sovereignty."" Can you explain what that is, or is it just like a standard dictionary definition?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: The most important thing President Karzai had said to us he needed out of the Bilateral Security Agreement was the ability to take it to his Afghan people and explain how it was going to bring security to Afghanistan beyond 2014.

The other thing that he said he needed was – and this was coming out of the Strategic Partnership Agreement – was improved understanding between the two of us in terms of what threats faced Afghanistan, both externally and internally. And what we were able to do, I think, in very broad terms, is find that common understanding in these 24 hours of talks, both in terms of the threats that Afghanistan faces internally and externally, the final language to characterize those threats, and then, more importantly, to characterize our commitment to enable the Afghans to defend themselves against those threats. And I think that was one of the major very difficult issues that was left to this late stage that we needed to work through.

QUESTION: Can you say what it – what the language says?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: No.

QUESTION: Is that because – and you can't say because you're waiting for – you don't want to preempt the Loya Jirga, or --

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah. I think we would want to wait until the right time, until the internal processes are more mature. We --

QUESTION: Yours or theirs?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Both. We have to put ours through a very technical, internal legal review. They have to put theirs through their interagency equivalent process with their national security council, and then prepare it to take to their people. And we certainly wouldn't want to disclose dimensions or parts of the language prematurely.

QUESTION: But it will be at some point.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: The language will be public, eventually.

QUESTION: [Senior Administration Official One], you were talking about defining the threats to Afghanistan and their ability to defend themselves. Is this the reference to the part about Afghanistan wanting the U.S. to give it a sort of defense pact, and that we would defend them against outside threats, presumably from Pakistan? That is part one of the question.

Part two is the issue on counterterrorism and them wanting us to hand over our intel and they do their own ops, and how did you address that?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Yes, on the first part, that the Bilateral Security Agreement is clearly something that stopped short of a mutual defense pact. And the language that we found, I think, is sufficient to both parties in terms of not overreaching the bounds of what can be – what kind of commitments we can come to.

On the counterterrorism language, it's a broad concept of cooperation at this point, which I think allows for enough flexibility in terms of their evolving capabilities, but also our needs to take actions in a joint, cooperative manner, when we need to. So, it's not so clear as, ""Hand over the intel and we'll take care of it."" It's not at that kind of an evolved stage.

QUESTION: When you say, ""when you need to,"" for joint actions, did you clarify when that would be? When would those joint actions take place? I mean is – would you have to define under what circumstances?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Well, I think the circumstances are any circumstances where the – there is a transnational threat, one that could impact upon U.S. homeland, U.S. allies, U.S. interests. But in all cases, that we would do so in a manner that was cooperative, in some cases – in many cases, partnered.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: Well, I think it's important to add that that's the way we would describe how we're handling CT right now. This is not a dramatic departure from the way that we're handling those operations under current policy guidance, the difference being that this is – when it goes into force, it would be a legally

binding agreement.

QUESTION: Can you please describe what – on this issue of immunity? Because from where we were sitting, it sounded, or personally to me, that this really couldn't be a deal unless that was agreed upon. And if the Secretary – or if an official is saying that it is in the text, well, then there is an agreement. But he was pretty clear in his quotes during the news conference that they weren’t --

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Let me put it this way. We've agreed on language that can be put to his Loya Jirga for their consideration.

QUESTION: In terms of the U.S. side, though, other than just this interagency review, I mean, the Pentagon is not going to come back and say, ""Sorry, this doesn't work for us."" It's a done deal, from the U.S. perspective.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: Well, I mean, that's the corollary to what [Senior Administration Official One] – the elaboration on what [Senior Administration Official One] said is the language that is in the text that goes to the Loya Jirga is satisfactory for our purposes on the --

QUESTION: So it’s the same question. As far as you're concerned, what you got is good, and it – and then – and I have this question I asked [Senior State Department Official One] earlier. Who signs it, if it gets approved by --

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Don't know yet.

QUESTION: But is it a presidential thing, or is it a Secretary --

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: We don't know what yet.

QUESTION: Who would sign it?

QUESTION: You don't know?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah, we don't know the details of the signing phase.

QUESTION: Why not? I mean, and – obviously, I guess not. But, I mean, other agreements like this --

QUESTION: Procedurally. Like, who signs it?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: I think it could be signed by a number of --

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: There are a lot of options.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: -- Cabinet or Administration people.

QUESTION: So it doesn't need to be president and president? It can be --

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Not necessarily.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: No. It could technically be a range of people.

And the other piece on the – just process-wise, is that the Secretary spoke with Secretary Hagel a number of times over the last 24 hours. He spoke with Susan Rice a number of times, other people on the team. And you guys would know better all the people that were – you were in contact with. But – about the text and the progress.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: We were in constant contact with the legal support team in Washington, and, as [Senior State Department Official Two] said, both --

QUESTION: And then my last one is --

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: I can't say whether Ambassador Rice was in touch with the President. But the Secretary was in direct contact with Ambassador Rice several times.

QUESTION: My last one here, and you can – it's a chance for you to talk up your boss. What was it – I mean, this stuff hadn't been agreed to beforehand. So what was it that the Secretary brought into this that got it done, basically? What – I mean, how did he change the dynamic? For 11 months, you haven't had a deal. You still don't, technically, but you got what could be a deal. So what was it that he was able to do to change the dynamic to get something done?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: I can start, but – I know. But still, I can talk just --

QUESTION: Just don’t make it too hagiographic.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Too what?

QUESTION: Hagiographic.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Hagiographic?

QUESTION: Hagiographic.

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Okay. Too – okay. One is their personal relationship and the fact that it goes back for a number of years, and you all know the details of that because we’ve talked about that previously and many of you covered it. Two is persistence. You’ve all covered the Secretary on a number of these occasions, on a number of these journeys to try to get agreement, right? And he is somebody who will sit there for hours and talk through the substantive issues, and this is something they can add more to. And three is probably patience. I didn’t even mean to do a three-piece. But patience, because obviously he wanted to --

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: I didn’t plan it. (Laughter.) But --

QUESTION: What about personality?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Sure. But they can add a little more perhaps from in the room, but, I mean, I think those are some of the characters and characteristics of these --

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: Fully agree with all that, and I would say also that sometimes you get to a point in these sorts of negotiations where both sides need higher-level political involvement to sort of get things further along. And it’s not clear the degree to which President Karzai had been engaged on the text before these last couple of days. Secretary Kerry obviously had been monitoring the negotiations, but had not been personally involved until the last couple of days. And having that kind of higher-level political push, I think, was essential to the progress that was achieved.

QUESTION: So would you agree with the characterization that this is really kind of a deal, or at least the last points fell into place – the last points falling into place is a deal between Karzai and the Secretary?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: I think it’s a deal between the United States and the Government of Afghanistan.

QUESTION: I know. In closing the circle, it was him and Karzai.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: The high-level political involvement was key to getting it to where it is now. There is no doubt about that.

QUESTION: To follow on that, so can you say now, then, that the purpose of this trip really was for the Secretary to close the deal? I mean, there was a lot of discussion ahead of time about --

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: I think we had a – I think we had to see where things stood. I mean, I don’t think I – I certainly didn’t deliberately mislead you when I said the other night he wasn’t coming here to close the deal, and I think he had a positive conversation with Karzai a week ago. Did we know, when he had a positive conversation, that the result if we showed up here was going to be getting what we got? No. But he knew that it was worth testing the proposition, and so here we are.

QUESTION: Was there any discussion about troop levels?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: I don’t think so.

QUESTION: So are there going to be (inaudible)?

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: So I defer to [Senior Administration Official One] on this.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: I didn’t hear.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: About troops (inaudible).

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah, all of our troops are trained and capable of conducting combat operations. There will be no combat mission after 2014. And what is clear is that combat operations would be much more exceptional after 2014 --

QUESTION: Much more what?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: Exceptional.

QUESTION: So CT doesn’t fall under combat, it’s a separate category?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE: No, I think it could. I think that the range of combat operations that you would have seen will be greatly reduced from what you have now. Frankly, they would be, again, the counterterrorism mission to go after residual transnational threats, and then there could be some combat operations in terms of the troops that are working inside the training, advise and assist mission. And then of course, if there were ever a contingency where you have a force protection mission, that could also be a combat operation, but that would be as a contingency, not as a general rule.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: All right. They’re trying to serve dinner.

QUESTION: Thank you.

QUESTION: And what was the time of the meetings? Was there a time today?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Let’s see, 9:30 to 12:15, then they broke for about two hours, though there were still talks between the teams, and the national security advisor hosted the lunch. So – and then they reconvened at 2:15. That went until about four-something, 4:30 maybe. They had about 30 minutes by themselves. Then --

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Yeah, at the end. Then they came back at 6:30, and we did the press avail at 9:00. So – and they had maybe 10 minutes by themselves before the avail. So, okay, I don’t know if anybody was adding that up.

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Eight hours today.

QUESTION: And then yesterday?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: And yesterday, yeah, it was about three hours. Yeah.

QUESTION: And on the calls, were they back to Washington?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Yeah.

QUESTION: When were they?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: I mean, they were throughout the last 24 hours. I mean, Secretary Kerry spoke with Hagel around this morning, before the day began. He spoke with him again, I believe. I’ll double check this. I can probably get you guys a list of the calls he did. But he spoke with Hagel and Rice a number of times. Other people on the team spoke with a number of other officials as well. Like, the Admiral, I think, spoke with somebody from the Joint Chiefs, and so on and so forth. But --

QUESTION: (Inaudible) the Secretary’s answer to my question on the Taliban (inaudible) some confusion over communication (inaudible)?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: There’s a chain of command.

QUESTION: Did Karzai ask him (inaudible)?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Not that I am aware of. I mean with – I don’t know that there’s much more we’re going to add on that, but I’ll talk to folks who were in all the meetings.

QUESTION: Afghan security forces (inaudible)?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Okay. I’ll ask and see if there was more talk of it aside from the one that we mentioned last night.

QUESTION: Was he trying to (inaudible) answer to the question of why there was, like, a miscommunication on the U.S. side when the Secretary --

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Not the U.S. side.

QUESTION: Oh. See, I kind of assumed (inaudible).

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: I don’t think he was implying the U.S. side.

QUESTION: So he was implying there was a miscommunication (inaudible).

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: I will talk to folks and see if there is more we can explain.

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: Yeah, I get it. Okay.

QUESTION: Thank you very much.

The attack was retribution for a coalition airstrike in which “up to 30 innocent civilians” were killed in a coalition airstrike north of Kabul, Afghanistan, two days before, the Taliban said. The attack was notable for targeting a low-security restaurant popular with foreigners, unlike more typical attacks where the Taliban targets fortified Western government compounds, according to The New York Times.

Among the dead are the United Nations chief political affairs officer in Afghanistan, the International Monetary Fund’s representative in the country, and two Americans working at the American University in Kabul.

[The New York Times]",Q1
http://www.dawn.com/news/1047802/taliban-separate-strands,Taliban: separate strands,"FOR those in favour of talking to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), there are few debating points more useful than the fact that the US and its allies support exactly such a strategy in Afghanistan.

But while the argument sounds persuasive, it’s wrong.

Wrong, because the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban may share a name but they are very different beasts. And they have given out very different signals about what they are prepared to concede in any negotiation.

We know this because for the last few years senior representatives of the Afghan Taliban in the Gulf charged by the movement’s political commission to conduct back channel talks have told foreign diplomats some quite surprising things.

Contrary to the bravado of the Taliban’s public propaganda, they say they know that an outright military victory is impossible and compromise essential. We are told they are desperate not to be responsible for triggering a renewed civil war.

For the most part these conversations have been confidential. But in 2012 they outlined their thinking to some academics, including Anatol Lieven and Michael Semple. According to their report, the Taliban officials said the movement has made peace with democracy and is prepared to renounce Al Qaeda and prevent its return to Afghanistan.

The most amazing concession for a movement supposedly waging jihad against foreign occupation is their willingness to accept the long-term presence of US military bases, which they recognise will be necessary to help sustain the Afghan National Army.

Many Pakistanis falsely interpret US enthusiasm for talks as a sign of a desperate search for a face-saving exit from the region.

Actually the US is exploring what looks like the makings of an acceptable deal. If they can pull it off then post-2014 Afghanistan will be a far less difficult and expensive problem to manage.

But if nothing comes of it, Plan B is already being put into effect: a foreign-financed Afghan security force strong enough to hold the Taliban-led insurgencies at bay.

Despite the encouraging words from the Taliban’s interlocutors in the Gulf, the West is not putting all of its chips on a negotiated settlement in the near term.

That’s sensible because this side of 2014 it is going to be very difficult for Taliban pragmatists to persuade fighters on the ground that the time has come to compromise on cherished goals. Unlike their leadership, most foot soldiers are convinced they are on the cusp of victory, largely because they have come to believe the movement’s own propaganda.

All of this starkly contrasts with the situation in Pakistan where PTI chairman Imran Khan has loudly signalled the political class’s desperation by repeatedly saying there is “no other option” except talks. Professing such weakness immediately undermines Pakistan’s negotiating position.

While agreement on a Doha political office came about after years of debate in Kabul and Western capitals, the idea for a TTP office in Pakistan has been described by one senior PTI figure as simply Khan “thinking out loud”.

And is there anyone that can truly speak for the TTP, a group made up of a bewildering multitude of groups? The Afghan Taliban are not completely solid either — they are the leading partners in a coalition which includes the Haqqani Network and Hizb-i-Islami. But it is nothing like the constellation of jihadi groups in Pakistan.

A single man, Mullah Omar, continues to exert strong control over the Afghan movement. The Lieven report argues that his support could be enough to make a deal stick.

There are many other differences. Islamabad’s pleas for talks are met with appalling acts of savagery and no one knows who exactly is responsible. At least the Afghan Taliban officially claim not to target civilians (even though they do).

Unlike the Quetta Shura, there is no indication that the TTP, or any other of the terror grouplets attacking Pakistan, has any serious political thinkers among its ranks who accept the futility of continued fighting.

Kabul and its foreign partners have also been clear and consistent about what is expected of the Taliban if there is to be a deal. In particular, they insist the constitution has to be respected.

By contrast Pakistani leaders have been all over the shop.

The final statement of the all-party conference said nothing of red lines or preconditions. Political leaders only asserted the primacy of the country’s Constitution after a torrent of media criticism triggered by the killing of senior army officers and the bombing of All Saints Church.

Strong narratives matter. In the 1980s Britains security services may have been in secret contact with the Irish Republican Army (IRA), but publicly the prime minister was adamant she would never talk to terrorists.

That the British government did finally open formal talks is another point often made by those in favour of something similar in Pakistan. But the differences between the two conflicts are more striking than the similarities.

Before talks began pragmatists within the IRA had to realise they were in a stalemate and then persuade enough of their comrades that they could never win the armed conflict.

Stalemates, as peace building experts argue, are ripe conditions for negotiations.

It’s a truism that nearly all insurgencies end in talks, including the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s, which is regarded as a textbook example of how counterinsurgency should be done. But the timing and conditions have to be right. They can’t be wished into being by desperate politicians.

Most of the time creating the right conditions for talks requires long and expensive military struggles. According to a 2008 study the average length of a successful post-1945 counter-insurgency campaign is 14 years.

There is a flicker of hope that Afghanistan might be approaching the right conditions for a peaceful outcome. But Pakistan is not Afghanistan, and the TTP is not the Afghan Taliban.

KABUL, Afghanistan, Nov. 20 (UPI) -- U.S. and Afghan officials said Wednesday they had resolved final disputes over the agreement on long-term American presence in Afghanistan. The Wall Street Journal said the resolution came just hours before the Loya Jirga assembly was to consider the deal. Advertisement

The breakthrough came after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Afghan President Hamid Karzai for the second straight day, the Journal said. The report said the crucial issue involved the circumstances under which U.S. troops could enter Afghan homes on counter-terror missions.

Kerry and Afghan officials confirmed the deal had been reached.

Only a day had remained before the Loya Jirga, made up of the country's tribal leaders, was to meet Thursday. The council's approval is essential to finalize the bilateral security agreement, which will determine how many U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of coalition forces by the end of 2014 and what role the residual U.S. force would play in Afghanistan.

There were mixed signals Tuesday on the draft agreement.

Aimal Faizi, a spokesman for Karzai, was quoted as saying the Afghan president had agreed in a last minute phone call, and U.S. President Barack Obama would write a letter to the Afghan people acknowledging past mistakes in the conduct of the war, including civilian casualties.

However, U.S. National Security adviser Susan Rice, appearing on CNN's ""Situation Room,"" said reports about the formal letter were false.

""No such letter has been drafted or delivered. There is not a need for the United States to apologize to Afghanistan,"" Rice said on the CNN program. ""Quite the contrary, we have sacrificed and supported them in their democratic progress and in tackling the insurgents and al-Qaida. So that [letter of apology] is not on the table.""

She termed the reports a ""complete misunderstanding of what the situation is.""

Separately, the Journal quoted U.S. officials as saying they saw the latest developments as last-minute political posturing by Karzai ahead of the Loya Jirga. They said Kerry in his telephone talk with Karzai didn't specify any intention to issue an apology. However, officials said it may be possible to send a letter expressing U.S. regret over civilian casualties in past military operations.

It was unclear if Kabul would allow counter-terror house searches only under ""extraordinary circumstances"" or if Karzai has already gotten a U.S. assurance to refrain from any action without first consulting Afghan authorities.

Another issue was granting immunity from local laws to U.S. troops for any crimes.

The Persian leopard cubs will grow to be the part of the largest leopard subspecies in the world. The giant cats once roamed all over southwest Russia’s Caucasus Mountains.

But habitat loss and heavy poaching have landed the beautiful creatures on the Conservation of Nature’s endangered species. It is estimated that only between 871 and 1,290 mature adults exist in the wild , reports LiveScience .

The two Persian leopard cubs were bred at the Persian Leopard Breeding Rehabilitation Center in Sochi National Park. The center’s goal is to reintroduce the population to the wild. The cubs’ parents came to the center from Portugal’s Lisbon Zoo.

Leopard cubs typically stay in their den for two months after birth. They get their food from their mother at first, but eventually develop their own hunting skills. Natalia Dronova, the World Wildlife Fund’s Russian species coordinator, released a statement about the leopard cubs’ birth, saying:

“They will eventually be released into the wild after learning skills, and will start a new population of leopards in the Caucasus Mountains.”

Along with Russia, the species also lives in Iran, eastern Turkey , southern Turkmenistan, and parts of western Afghanistan, notes UPI . In time, the center hopes to help the population return back to its original state. Umar Semyonov, head of the breeding center, stated of the newborns. “It is too early to tell the sex of the cubs. They’re in the den with their mother and center staff don’t want to disturb them.”

The young leopards’ eyes won’t open for seven to nine days after birth. While staff haven’t handled the Persian leopard cubs yet, they are believed to be about six inches long. They weigh about 1.5 pounds. A full-grown Persian leopard will weigh about 200 pounds.

Noor Anwarzai, 36, was sentenced by Afghanistan’s Special Anti-Corruption Tribunal on April 8, 2013. The Tribunal found Mr. Anwarzai guilty of violating Afghan Penal Code Article 268, regarding embezzlement of funds and Article 310 regarding the forgery of official documents.

Abdul Khabir Kakar, another former contractor accused in the case, was acquitted and subsequently released. He was not found to have been involved in the fraud.

The sentencing came as part of what U.S. Government officials described as an ongoing campaign against fraud and waste in reconstruction and development activities in Afghanistan. The investigation was conducted jointly by the Afghanistan Attorney General’s Office Anti-Corruption Unit and USAID’s Office of Inspector General.

Commenting on the Anti-Corruption Tribunal’s ruling, USAID’s Deputy Inspector General Michael G. Carroll expressed his appreciation for the strong partnership between USAID’s OIG investigators and Afghan law enforcement officials that led to the recent ruling. “Partnerships with law enforcement agencies overseas are critical to our efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in development activities worldwide. This sentencing demonstrates how effective these partnerships can be,” he said.

Noor Anwarzai and Abdul Khabir Kakar are former employees of the recently concluded Afghanistan Farm Service Alliance project implemented by Citizen’s Network for Foreign Affairs (CNFA). The two were arrested by the Afghan National Police in November 2012 on charges of conspiring to embezzle approximately $10,000 of USAID funds. They were accused of falsifying official documentation from the Afghan Ministry of Finance, indicating that CNFA had paid the appropriate local property taxes for the office building when they had not.",Q1
http://rt.com/usa/narcotic-painkiller-zohydro-fda-350/,Powerful painkiller without abuse protections approved using controversial trial method,"Despite recommendations by its own advisers, the US Food and Drug Administration approved last month a powerful new opioid painkiller without abuse-deterrent ingredients and tested through favorable methods.

In addition, the first hydrocodone-only opioid Zohydro, approved by an FDA panel vote of 11 to 2 in late October, is manufactured by the same company, Alkermes, that makes the popular medication Vivitrol used to treat addiction to painkillers and alcohol.



Alkermes also provides financial support to a powerful professional group of substance abuse experts, the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

Zohydro is set to come in doses that will contain five to 10 more narcotic than established hydrocodone products like Vicodin, which is hydrocodone mixed with everyday painkillers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

Zohydro dosages are designed to be released over a span of 12 hours, but abusers of the drug will be able to crush, chew or mix it with alcohol to release its effects much quicker.

A November 2012 memo from the FDA’s staff warned Zohydro could be abused more than other hydrocodone products, such as extended-release, oxycodone-containing opioids were in previous years, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

The most notorious of oxycodones is the oft-abused narcotic Oxycontin. Its maker, Purdue Pharma, recalibrated the pill’s recipe with an abuse deterrent in 2010.

Zohydro, however, will not have to adhere to those same protections, at least not yet. One day before the approval of Zohydro, the FDA tightened rules on hydrocodone products, requiring the same Schedule 2 abuse-deterring restrictions as oxycodone products. Nevertheless, Zohydro received approval as is, despite a recommendation against it by an FDA advisory panel in December.

During the FDA advisory committee hearing that month, an official from Zogenix, the company that sought approval for Zohydro, said an abuse-deterrent recipe for the drug is in early development, “several years away from the market.”

An FDA spokesperson, Morgan Liscinsky, told the Journal Sentinel in October that while the agency that is vital for Americans’ health supports opioids that discourage abuse, “we do not believe it is appropriate or feasible at this time to require all products in the class to be abuse-deterrent.”

""Rather, FDA will continue to take a product-by-product approach to regulatory decisions concerning the abuse-deterrent properties (or lack thereof) of opioid products.""

The drug wasn’t always owned by Alkermes, maker of the popular painkiller-addiction treatment, Vivitrol. Alkermes wasn’t involved in efforts to get Zohydro approved in the US, either.

Zogenix, a small California-based company, purchased the right to market Zohydro in the US from drugmaker Elan in 2010, the New York Times reported. A year later, Alkermes bought a unit of Elan that included Zohydro and other products, inheriting Elan’s existing agreement with Zogenix.

In seeking FDA approval for the drug, Zogenix officials said they would watch for abuse of the drug and act quickly to curb any problems. Days after the approval vote, Zogenix announced an agreement with Altus Formulation under which Altus would work on developing a form of Zohydro that was resistant to abuse.

""While the current formulation of Zohydro ER does not have abuse-deterrent or tamper-proof features, we have started the development of an abuse-deterrent formulation and are committed to advancing the program as rapidly as possible,"" Zogenix said in a statement to the Journal Sentinel.

Drugs like OxyContin that have the abuse protections in place - a point the drug’s maker Purdue Pharma used to vanquish all makers of generic versions of it - are made with a consistency that morphs when crushed, causing difficulty in snorting or injecting the drug. Yet such formulations can take years to develop successfully, if at all.

In a statement, Zogenix president, Dr. Stephen J. Farr, said the FDA only recently offered guidelines for opioid features it wanted to see that sought to avoid abuse.

“Zogenix is fully engaged in efforts to bring an abuse-deterrent-form formulation of Zohydro,” to market, Farr said.

FDA officials say Zohydro was approved so another long-acting opioid for patients with chronic pain would be available. FDA spokesperson Liscinsky said the agency determined it was safe and effective for long-term use, and that its label will warn of potential abuse.

""Prescribers now have a hydrocodone option for patients who require an extended-release opioid, which is important for several reasons,"" she told the Journal Sentinel. ""First, individual patients can respond differently to different opioids. Second, the benefits of opioids can wane as the patient becomes opioid-tolerant.""

Zogenix started a clinical trial of Zohydro in 2010. It was approved using the controversial method known as enriched enrollment, which allows drug companies to avoid using test patients who don’t respond well to a medication or who can’t tolerate its use ahead of the beginning of clinical trials.

The approach, cheaper than other methods, is criticized for being a way for companies to make a drug seem more effective, helping its chances of FDA approval. Some call it cheating, and that the method does not give an accurate representation of the drug’s effects once on the market for the masses.

Many in the panel of FDA advisers that voted against Zohydro in December said they were concerned about what would happen once the drug left clinical trials, according to the hearing transcript.

""The question of what's effective is much greater than (the pain score of the test subjects) at the end of 12 weeks in a very limited, controlled experiment that somehow was a little bit better than a placebo group,"" panel member Judith Kramer, a professor of medicine at Duke University, said at the hearing.

""With treatment of chronic pain, are we really, in the long run, helping people, or are we creating an epidemic? This drug will almost certainly cause dependence in the people that are intended to take it.""

Liscinsky said the enriched enrollment method is good for personalized medicine in that it helps find those whom a drug will be effective in.

""Enrichment will not save a drug that is not safe or effective, but it will help find one that is,"" she said.

Another advisory panel member disagreed with that assessment.

""I happen to live in the real world, and I would think that the (Zohydro) study population is very different than the real world population,"" said Alan Kaye, a professor of anesthesia at Louisiana State University School of Medicine. ""And as such, I certainly feel there would be quite a bit of morbidity and mortality that would result.""

Alkermes has sought to increase sales of Vivitrol in recent years for the treatment of alcohol and opioid abuse. Though the company seems to understand the conflict of interest some are now pointing to following Zohydro’s approval.

In a statement to the New York Times, Alkermes spokeswoman Rebecca Peterson said the company was “evaluating its role with respect to Zohydro” as a result of the drug’s approval.

Critics said the Zohydro situation amplifies problematic links between industry and the government, as well as some drug companies multiple roles in the industry.

An investigative report by the Journal Sentinel in October revealed an annual conference - IMMPACT - where invitation-only drug industry representatives paid $35,000 to attend an event that gave access to FDA officials and other government agencies to discuss improved designs for clinical trials.

Dr. Andrew J. Kolodny, the chief medical officer of Phoenix House, which has drug and alcohol treatment facilities nationwide, told New York Times he thought the American Society of Addiction Medicine, of which he is a member, should refuse money from a company that has a product that could worsen drug abuse in the US. Though he added Phoenix House will continue use of Vivitrol for patients.

Tensions are running high after a near-collision of U.S. and Chinese naval vessels this month and an air defense zone China has declared over an area that includes territory controlled by Japan, a U.S. ally. Those actions have raised fresh alarm as Beijing modernizes its military and claims a wide swath of ocean and disputed islands across the East and South China Seas.

Kerry used his first visit to Vietnam as America’s top diplomat to reiterate support for diplomacy between Southeast Asia’s regional bloc and Beijing over the territorial disputes, and to provide aid for Southeast Asian nations to defend waters they claim as their own.

Kerry pledged $32.5 million, including up to $18 million for Vietnam that will include five fast patrol boats for its Coast Guard. With the new contribution, U.S. maritime security assistance to the region will exceed $156 million over the next two years, he said.

Kerry used his first visit to Vietnam as America’s top diplomat to reiterate support for diplomacy between Southeast Asia’s regional bloc and Beijing over the territorial disputes, and to provide aid for Southeast Asian nations to defend waters they claim as their own.

Kerry pledged $32.5 million, including up to $18 million for Vietnam that will include five fast patrol boats for its Coast Guard. With the new contribution, U.S. maritime security assistance to the region will exceed $156 million over the next two years, he said.

“Peace and stability in the South China Sea is a top priority for us and for countries in the region,” Kerry told reporters at a news conference with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh. “We are very concerned by and strongly opposed to coercive and aggressive tactics to advance territorial claims.”

The next stop on his Asian trip will be the Philippines, which lost control of a disputed reef in the South China Sea last year after a standoff with China. The U.S. is also helping equip the Philippines with ships and radar, and is in negotiations with Manila to increase the American military presence there.

Kerry said the new assistance was not a “quickly conceived reaction to any events in the region” but rather a “gradual and deliberate expansion” of U.S. support as part of the Obama administration’s broader decision to refocus attention on the Asia-Pacific.

But the step is almost certain to anger Beijing, which bristles at what it sees as U.S. interference in areas it views as China’s “core interest.” Beijing looks dimly on Washington’s push to increase the U.S. military presence and strengthen its alliances in Asia as it ends a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, calling it an attempt to contain China.

In a reminder of the high stakes in play, U.S. and Chinese naval vessels came close to colliding in the South China Sea on Dec. 5, the most serious incident between the two navies since 2009.

The U.S. Pacific Fleet said Saturday that USS Cowpens was operating in international waters and had to maneuver to avoid hitting China’s lone aircraft carrier. The Liaoning, a symbol of China’s ambition to develop a navy that operates further from its own shores, only entered service last year and was on its first-ever sea trials in the South China Sea.

Beijing has not formally commented on the incident, but the state-run Global Times newspaper reported on Monday that the U.S. ship had first harassed the Liaoning and its group of support ships, getting too close to a Chinese naval drill and entering within 30 miles of the Chinese fleet’s “inner defense layer.”

As China expands its navy’s reach and starts to challenge decades of American military predominance in the region, it’s becoming more common for vessels of the two nations to operate in close proximity. The Obama administration has made it a priority to seek closer military cooperation with China to prevent misunderstandings that could spark a clash — part of a broader push to foster friendly ties between the established world power and the emerging one.

Beijing’s unilateral declaration in late November of its East China Sea air defense identification zone was a setback, and has ratcheted up tensions with Japan over disputed islands within that zone. All aircraft entering the zone must notify Chinese authorities beforehand, and China has said it would take unspecified defensive measures against those that don’t comply.

The U.S., Japan and South Korea have said they will not honor the new zone, and in a show of defiance soon after China announced it, the U.S. flew two B-52 bombers through the area.

The issue loomed large during meetings in Beijing between Vice President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in early December, and Kerry offered harsh words about the zone in Hanoi Monday. He said it “clearly increases the risk of a dangerous miscalculation or an accident.” He called for intensified diplomacy to address the issue.

“The zone should not be implemented, and China should refrain from taking similar unilateral actions elsewhere, particularly in the South China Sea,” Kerry said, reiterating that such moves by Beijing would not affect U.S. military operations in the region.

Three years ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, also in Hanoi, raised hackles in Beijing by declaring that the U.S. had a national interest in the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea, where China, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam have competing claims. Those disputes have occasionally flared, including a 1988 naval battle between China and Vietnam that left 70 Vietnamese sailors dead.

Washington has supported efforts by Southeast Asia’s regional bloc to negotiate collectively with their larger neighbor China on a legally binding code of conduct to manage the disputes. Stressing U.S. neutrality on the competing sovereignty claims, Kerry again called for quick agreement on the code and peaceful resolution of disputes.

Those efforts have made some headway in the past year, but Beijing would still prefer to negotiate with each country separately. It regards the entire South China Sea and island groups within it as its own and interprets international law as giving it the right to police foreign naval activity there.",Q1

The Defense proposal, part of the Obama administration's full budget rollout, is an increase of just $1.2 billion from the prior year.

Under the plan, the budget would terminate ""lower-priority and poorly performing weapons programs,"" according to a statement from the department.

The Pentagon also says it intends to look into consolidating its existing defense infrastructure and combining military treatment facilities.

The proposal also calls for another round of base closures and consolidation in 2015, a program known as Base Realignment and Closing, or BRAC. That will likely trigger debate on Capitol Hill because the last effort to consolidate bases, in 2005, is still costing Defense than it's saving.

""BRAC is a comprehensive and fair tool that allows communities a role in re-use decisions by them for their property and provides it redevelopment assistance,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said at a briefing. ""This process is an imperfect process and there are upfront costs for BRAC.""

""This budget adds $2.4 billion over the next five years to pay for those costs but in the long term, there are significant savings, as we've seen from past BRAC decisions,"" Hagel added.

The Pentagon won't see a return on the cost of the 2005 effort until 2018, a department source said. At that rate, a new base closing initiative would be a drain on the Defense budget until at least 2028.

The department said the budget also""slows the growth of military pay and benefits. But it does not reduce the number of soldiers or Marines any further than had been planned for the past several months.

""These changes, which have the strong support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, save about $1.4 billion in FY 2014 and a total of $12.8 billion over the next five years,"" Hagel said.

The army is aiming for 490,000 soldiers and the Marine Corps is set to get its numbers down to 182,000.

The proposed budget seeks to sidestep the contentious issue of forced budget cuts known as the sequester.

""Unfortunately, FY 2014 programs will be significantly and adversely affected by sequester budget cuts in FY 2013,"" the release said. ""Training cutbacks, civilian furloughs, deferral of equipment and facility maintenance...will inevitably have rippling effects into FY 2014.,"" the release said.

Related: Wasteful spending targeted in budget.

The Pentagon said the president's proposal includes enough deficit reduction plans to would allow Congress to replace and repeal any reductions forced by the sequester.

There is no ""war budget"" in this request. The so-called Overseas Contingencies Operation was delayed by the planning for troop levels in Afghanistan completed just this February. The request will be sent to Congress ""in coming weeks.""

Spending on many of the Pentagon's most expensive new weapons systems will decrease under this proposal compared to what was spent on the programs in 2012.

For example, for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the department's most expensive weapons program, the budget calls for spending $8.4 billion down from the $9.1 billion spent on the F-35 in 2012.

Spending on the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft is down to $1.8 billion in the proposal compared to $2.8 billion in 2012.

And the Pentagon is proposing spending less on its most high-profile unmanned aircraft, the Predator, Reaper and Global Hawk. Spending on the three drones will be down to $2.06 billion in this budget compared to the $3.6 billion spent in 2012.

Spending is up on some systems, including the C-130 cargo jet, the KC-46A midair refueling tanker and the Littoral Combat Ship, a new class of warship designed to fight in shallow waters such as harbors or rivers.",Q1

Robert Bales, who pleaded guilty to killing 16 Afghan civilians, to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Bales, 40, entered the guilty plea last June in a deal to avoid the death penalty.

During his court-martial here Thursday, Bales had apologized for his actions but did not offer an explanation for the violence. He described the killings as an “act of cowardice, behind a mask of fear, bulls -- and bravado.”

“I’m truly, truly sorry to those people whose families got taken away,” the father of two said. “I can’t comprehend their loss. I think about it every time I look at my kids.”

The six-member military jury deliberated about two hours Friday morning following closing arguments. As a result of Bales’ guilty plea, jurors were only deciding whether he would be eligible for parole.

During the proceeding, his defense sought to humanize him as a dependable and upstanding man -- a good father, a good soldier, a good friend -- who had been tormented by war.

Noting his use of steroids and alcohol, prosecutors countered that Bales has a troubled history with his marriage, finances and authority figures. They also focused on the toll the rampage took on the families he attacked and on the military’s relationships in Afghanistan.

Marine Corps photo / Lance Cpl. David N. Hersey Marines board a KC-130J Hercules aircraft Sunday in Japan, bound for the typhoon-ravaged Philippines.

Nearly 100 U.S. Marines and sailors are already on the ground in the Philippines, amid the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan, the vanguard of a U.S. military force that is sure to balloon in coming days.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the U.S. Pacific Command into action following the weekend storm, which may have left 10,000 Filipinos dead. The initial batch of 90 Marines and sailors flew more than 1,500 miles south before arriving Sunday in the Philippines from the Marines’ air station at Futenma, Japan, on a pair of KC-130J cargo planes. Their initial efforts will involve search and rescue before transitioning to transportation and logistics.

They arrived in the hard-hit city of Tacloban Monday afternoon. “Roads are impassable, trees are all down, posts are down, power is down,” Marine Brigadier General Paul Kennedy, the commanding general of the Okinawa-based 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, told reporters. “I am not sure what else is there. I am not sure how else to describe this destruction.” Another 180 Marines are en route, U.S. officials said, and the Pentagon is standing by for expected requests for additional aid from the Philippine government.

“Our hearts go out to the people of the Philippines,” Pentagon spokesman George Little said. “This is a tremendously damaging storm.”

The Pentagon is working alongside the U.S. Agency for International Development in coordinating aid. “Within hours, the U.S. embassy in Manila provided substantial financial assistance for health, water and sanitation,” Secretary of State John Kerry said. “The U.S. government is organizing emergency shipments of critically needed material to provide shelter to the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos driven from their homes by this unprecedented typhoon.”

Over the Veterans Day weekend, Team Rubicon, a nonprofit group of U.S. veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq, announced it was deploying ex-troops to help in the rescue effort. “The primary objectives of Operation: Seabird are facilitating search and rescue efforts and providing medical triage for a full-scale field hospital in Tacloban,” the group said.

The Philippine government said the disaster affected more than 4.2 million people in the central part of the Philippine archipelago. The death toll from one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall has already reached about 1,000, but is expected to climb as rescuers reach and communications are restored to the region.

The U.S. has only a “small footprint” in the Philippines, Little said. It’s a far cry from the 40,000 U.S. troops who used to call Subic Bay and Clark airfield home. The Filipino government ordered the U.S. Navy out of Subic Bay in 1991, nearly a century after the U.S. captured the islands from Spain (the eruption of Mount Pinatubo forced the closure of Clark earlier that same year). Last year, Manila said the U.S. military could return to Subic and Clark.

Regardless of that history, the U.S. military was the most visible sign of international aid following Mother Nature’s carnage. When a destructive storm hits hapless innocents, the U.S. military generally is among the first to arrive with water, food, tents and medical aid. Since 1990, in fact, the U.S. government has helped Manila respond to more than 40 disasters, including droughts, floods and volcanoes.

“It’s the right thing to do,” Navy Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, the Pacom commander, told the American Forces Press Service. “If something is going to happen in the Pacific that is going to create a churn in the security environment, the most likely thing will be a humanitarian disaster problem of some kind.” That’s quite a statement, given the wars in Korea and Vietnam, the non-stop provocations from North Korea, and the perpetual whispering campaign in some U.S. quarters to turn China into the next big U.S. foe.",Q1

Cop Hears Screaming at Fire, Rescues Two","Feb. 01--As officer Jeremy Wallace arrived at the home on West Powell Street late Thursday night he saw heavy smoke and flames shooting into the air.

Wallace, a patrol officer with the Dothan Police Department, responded to an emergency dispatch call of a fire at a home that possibly had two people inside, including a blind woman who was also an amputee. Wallace was the first of emergency personnel on the scene of the fire.

""I just felt like I needed to get in there and get these people out,"" Wallace said. ""I could hear them screaming. I just did what I thought was right.""

Wallace went to a side door and found it cracked open. As he entered the home he found what initially appeared, amid thick smoke, to be a woman.

""I couldn't see because there was so much smoke. She was just kind of standing over him, I guess like a protective mom, but they were both screaming,"" Wallace said. ""I just kind of picked her up and carried her outside, and I just kind of picked him up off the floor like a sack a potatoes.""

Using a flashlight, he believes he found the mother and son inside a laundry room.

Wallace guided the woman down a chain link fence before heading back inside the burning house a second time for the woman's son, who he found on the floor. After getting the man outside to safety Wallace inquired about other occupants in the home. He was told there were none. But the man asked about his mother. Wallace told him she was safe.

Dothan Fire Department Battalion Chief Chris Etheredge said no one was injured in the fire. He also said the fire appeared to be an accident.

The man and his mother could not be located Friday for comment.

Dothan Police Capt. David Jay, the supervisor of the patrol division, said a patrol officer is automatically dispatched to all fire dispatch calls in the city.

""It's not unheard of for officers to go and help people out of burning structures,"" Jay said. ""That's what we do. We're here to protect the lives of our citizens any way we can.""

Jay said it appeared Wallace had responded to the emergency fire call and was at the home within minutes. Paramedics checked out the home's occupants along with Wallace at the scene of fire.

Wallace recalled how he and the two people in the home had been coughing afterward from some apparent smoke inhalation. But no one was taken to a hospital.

Wallace, a two-year officer with the Dothan Police Department, said it was the first time he went in a burning building to rescue anyone.

""I was in the Army before this, and did three tours overseas (in Iraq and Afghanistan) so I've seen my fair share,"" Wallace said. ""I just felt like I did what any good person would do, the best they could to help. As long as they're OK that's all that really matters at the end of the day. ""

“We wanted this murderer to be executed,” said Hajji Mohammad Wazir, who lost 11 family members in the attack by Staff Sgt. Robert Bales. “We were brought all the way from Afghanistan to see if justice would be served. Not our way — justice was served the American way.”

Bales, 40, pleaded guilty in June in a deal to avoid the death penalty for his March 11, 2012, raids near his remote outpost in Kandahar province, when he stalked through mud-walled compounds and shot 22 people — 17 of them women and children. Some screamed for mercy, while others didn’t even have a chance to get out of bed.

The soldier showed no emotion as the sentence was announced at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, south of Seattle.

His mother, sitting in the front row of the court, bowed her head, rocked in her seat, and wept.

An interpreter flashed a thumbs-up sign to a row of Afghan villagers who were either wounded or lost family members in the March 11, 2012, attacks.

“I saw his mother trying to cry, but at least she can go visit him,” Hajji Mohammad Naim, who was shot in the neck, said after the sentencing. “What about us? Our family members are actually 6 feet under.”

The villagers, who traveled nearly 7,000 miles to testify against Bales, spoke with reporters and asked through an interpreter what it would be like for someone to break into American homes and slaughter their families.

Bales never offered an explanation for why he armed himself with a 9 mm pistol and an M-4 rifle and left his post on the killing mission, but he apologized on the witness stand Thursday and described the slaughter as an “act of cowardice, behind a mask of fear, bulls— and bravado.”

The six-member jury weighing whether he would be eligible for parole after 20 years took about 90 minutes to decide the case in favor of prosecutors who described Bales as a “man of no moral compass.”

“In just a few short hours, Sgt. Bales wiped out generations,” Lt. Col. Jay Morse told the jury in his closing argument. “Sgt. Bales dares to ask you for mercy when he has shown none.”

A commanding general overseeing the court-martial has the option of reducing the sentence to life with the possibility of parole.

Defense attorney Emma Scanlan argued for the lighter sentence, begging jurors to consider her client’s prior life and years of good military service and suggested he snapped under the weight of his fourth combat deployment. She read from a letter Bales sent to his two children 10 weeks before the killing: “The children here are a lot like you. They like to eat candy and play soccer. They all know me because I juggle rocks for them.”

“These aren’t the words of a cold-blooded murderer,” Scanlan said.

She also read from a letter sent by a fellow soldier, a captain who said that Bales seemed to have trouble handling a decade of war and death: “The darkness that had been tugging at him for the last 10 years swallowed him whole.”

Prosecutors laying out the case for a life term, argued that Bales’ own “stomach-churning” words demonstrated that he knew exactly what he was doing.

“My count is 20,” Bales told another soldier when he returned to the base.

Morse displayed a photograph of a girl’s bloodied corpse and described how Bales executed her where she should have felt safest — beside her father, who was also slain.

Morse also played a surveillance video of Bales returning to the base after the killings, marching with “the methodical, confident gait of a man who’s accomplished his mission.”

Bales, an Ohio native who lived in Lake Tapps, Wash., was under personal, financial and professional stress at the time. He had stopped paying the mortgage on one of his houses, was concerned about his wife’s spending and hadn’t received a promotion he wanted.

“Sgt. Bales commits these barbaric acts because he takes stock of his life,” Morse said. “Sgt. Bales thinks the rest of the world is not giving him what he deserves.”

The closing arguments came a day after Bales apologized for the attack, saying he’d bring back the victims “in a heartbeat” if he could.

“I’m truly, truly sorry to those people whose families got taken away,” he said in a mostly steady voice during questions from one of his lawyers. “I can’t comprehend their loss. I think about it every time I look at my kids.”

He said he hoped his words would be translated for the nine villagers who traveled from Afghanistan to testify against him — none of whom elected to be in court to hear him testify.",Q1

KABUL, Afghanistan, Oct. 10 (UPI) -- Dozens of Taliban fighters were killed or injured Thursday in clashes with Afghan security forces over control of a former coalition base, local officials say. The base formerly occupied by NATO troops in Daykundi province was seized by militants five days ago, Khaama Press reported. Advertisement

Provincial governor Abdul Haq Shafiq said local residents assisted security forces in driving the militants from the area.

“Although, the PTI government had announced to issue these bonds after coming into power, the initiative

was halted for a short period, but now I have received the go-ahead from the prime minister,” said the finance minister.

He said although these were debt instruments, they would also be working on inviting overseas Pakistanis for equity investments.

In this process, the Board of Investment (BoI) and Special Assistant to Prime Minister for Overseas Pakistanis would have a pivotal role. They have to design and market these products,” Asad Umar said this while giving a live interview on the PTI’s social media page on Saturday night (Oct 13).

Asad said the foreign exchange earnings come through exports, remittances, foreign direct investment (FDI) or you borrow loans. Whereas outflows are on imports, profit repatriation of foreigners on their investment in Pakistan, debt servicing and repayments.

This constitutes the broader measurement of economic balances i.e. Current Account Deficit (CAD).

When the IMF latest programme ended in October 2016, there was $18.9 billion forex reserves, but in last 24 months these have gone down to $8.2 billion.

In last few months, the slide in reserve accelerated fast as on average addition in CAD was recorded at $2 billion a month. The market got nervous and caused the rupee to depreciate, as dollar supply was low, so bailout package was imminent.

Regarding the public concern that why the government delayed approach to the IMF, he said, “If we had approached the IMF on the first day, they would have started blaming us for not seeking and exploring other avenues.”

Asad said he had taken oath on August 20 and exactly after two weeks he had talked to the IMF.

He said it was one of the options that we were trying to explore simultaneously and exactly the same was told to the IMF official.

“We also asked the Fund for sending a staff mission to Pakistan and it came on September 27 to October 4, 2018. The mission did an evaluation and shared with us a concept note.

Meantime, we were in discussion with China and its foreign minister visited Pakistan. The prime minister also visited Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

We got phenomenally positive response in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In follow-up, a high-powered Saudi delegation visited Pakistan for five days. Another high-powered team of the UAE is also coming to Pakistan on October 19.

In recent IMF/World Bank meeting, I had meetings with the finance ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE. We had also taken inputs from country’s top economists on this issue.

Regarding decline in the Pakistani stock market by nine percent, he asked why India stock market got down by 10pc and so of Malaysia.

Almost all emerging markets are on the decline because of international economic scenario, as the US interest rate is going up, there is China-US trade war, oil prices are going up fast. So it is because of global scenario and no link with delay in going to the IMF.

In December 2017, Pakistani rupee had also devaluated from Rs105 and in August 2018 when the PTI came into power it was at Rs128 to a dollar. This was not because of the IMF but due to declining reserves and increasing financial gaps.

This proposed program with the IMF is the 19th program with the Fund of the country’s history. The PPP and PML have done it, and even military governments had availed themselves of these programs for seven times.

He said at the moment, Pakistan’s ‘economic jehad’ is exports. We should focus on it more. Look towards increasing exports business, garments, IT, software, business process outsourcing, SMEs, manufacturing and value added agriculture. Through, focusing it, Pakistan can come out of the crises.",Q1

Angie Stone's soldier son Gregg was killed last year in Afghanistan

Her daughter Jennie was tragically killed in a car crash this February

Now her other daughter Rosie-Ann is being prosecuted for the crash

Devastated Mrs Stone says she is trapped in a 'bad, bad dream'



A mother has described how she is living in a 'bad, bad dream' after her daughter was told she would be prosecuted for killing her sibling in a car crash.

Angie Stone said the family was already coping with the grief of losing her son, Gregg, 20, a few months earlier after being shot dead in Afghanistan when daughter Jennie, 29, died in the collision.

Her third child, Rosie-Ann, 20, was behind the wheel of her own car when Jennie's vehicle hit a tree in Fraisthorpe, West Yorkshire, and she is now facing prosecution.

Describing the pain the family has had to cope with already, she said the decision by the CPS was like 'losing another of our babies'.

Tragic: Jennie Stone was killed in February when the car she was travelling in hit a tree. Her sister is being prosecuted for the crash and last year, her brother died in Afghanistan

Mrs Stone, 56, said: 'Have our family not lost enough already? It is like being trapped in a bad, bad dream.'

She, who said the sisters were extremely close, has vowed to fight the decision 'tooth and nail' and said she cannot mourn properly with a court case hanging over the family.

She believes Jennie would be appalled by the CPS’s decision if she was still alive.



She said: 'This is not going to achieve anything at all, no good outcome whatsoever.

'Even Jennie’s son Charlie knew Rosie was in the other car and he said to us ""I don’t want anything to happen to you, Rosie. I don’t want you to go to court and get in trouble"".

'There is nothing to be achieved apart from destroying the family even more. I thought the CPS was human. Enough, enough, the family have suffered enough.'

A CPS spokeswoman said: 'Rosie-Ann Stone has been reported for summons for driving without due care and causing a fatality.

Private Gregg Thomas Stone, from the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was the first of the sibling to be killed. He died in Afghanistan on Sunday June 3 2012 when trying to rescue an Afghan policeman

'We are aware of the incredibly emotive circumstances of this case but must adhere to the Code for Crown Prosecutors which requires our lawyers to consider two things.

'The first is whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Where this is met, and it is in this case, we must consider whether it is in the public interest to prosecute.

'To make this decision we have sought the views of all parties including the Stones’ family and Jennie’s immediate family.

'Taking into account all of the information available to us at this time, we have concluded that it is in the public interest to prosecute Rosie-Ann and have advised Humberside Police to report her for summons.'

Jennie, a final-year student at the University of Lincoln’s Hull campus, had been driving a Peugeot 206 towards Bridlington when she was in collision with a Vauxhall Astra, driven by her younger sister Rosie-Ann, before crashing into a tree.

She had just dropped her son Charlie, then aged nine, at Skipsea Primary School.

Ms Stone says Jennie, pictured, would be mortified at the thought of her sister being prosecuted for the car crash

According to police at the time, both cars were travelling in the same direction and were trying to overtake a truck which was also travelling north.

Jennie had moved in with her partner, Dave Parker, just 24 hours before she was killed.

Rosie-Ann Stone is expected to appear in court before magistrates in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, next month.

'These guys aim to achieve something quite remarkable, and in doing so will prove to everybody else that even though you've lost a leg or lost an arm, or whatever your illness may be, that you can achieve pretty much anything if you put your mind to it.'

He added: 'This trip is another way of reminding everybody that as Afghanistan draws down and these guys aren't in the news any more... the support must continue.'

Speaking at London Heathrow Airport on Sunday before departing, British army veteran Ibrar Ali, whose right arm was amputated after a roadside bombing in Afghanistan in 2007, felt both nervous and excited about the challenge ahead.



'A bit like pre-tour when you're just about sat at Brize Norton (airbase) when you're just about to go out to Iraq or Afghanistan,' he said.

Speaking of Harry's involvement, he added: 'He's a great team member and just fits in really well so no different to anyone else.'

Harry, who is fourth in line to the throne, joined the Walking With The Wounded trek to the North Pole in 2011.

http://www.dvidshub.net/news/111867/medic-takes-flight,Medic takes flight,"KANDAHAR AIRFIELD, Afghanistan – Army Sgt. Jason Daniels, a native of Sand Rock, Ala., and flight medic assigned to C Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment, has played a key role in Task Force Knighthawk’s medical evacuation program.



According to his supervisors, Daniels embodies the skill-set necessary to be an aviation flight medic – a key component to Task Force Knighthawk’s medevac success during Operation Enduring Freedom XII-XIII under Task Force Falcon.



When asked why he chose to become a flight medic, Daniels said, “There is no other occupation for him because this is by far the most rewarding job in the Army, and I am honored to have the opportunity to make a difference.”



Daniels enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves in 2004 to establish himself in a profession that would make his family proud and to serve his country. Three years later, he made the decision to enlist active duty. He has been saving the lives of Afghan National Security Forces and local national civilians during his current tour in Afghanistan with Task Force Knighthawk.



“There is a lot of history in Army medevac and it is amazing to see how far we have come with patient treatment,” said Daniels. “I’m just proud to be a part of it.”



The patient treatment Daniels is referring to is the “Vampire” program. According to Maj. Jason Jones, commander, C Company, the administration of packed red blood cells on board medevac helicopters is not new to trauma medicine, but the far-forward use of PRBCs, potentially within minutes of injury, is definitely on the leading edge of pre-hospital care. Jones says that pre-hospital use of blood as fluid therapy in trauma is not yet proven to change the patient’s outcome.



Daniels, who works with the blood program, also works as one of the medical training noncommissioned officers charged with teaching junior flight medics from the task force. Earlier this year, he was crucial to the Kandahar Air Wing flight medic training that certified the KAW flight medics on in-flight care. Task Force Knighthawk certified Afghan air force flight medics and instructors to sustain the program.



""Afghan medics now have the mental skill set and knowledge to facilitate a transition from coalition-provided health care to health care provided by their own,” said Daniels. “The Afghan medics have been very receptive toward the instruction that was provided because of their willingness to learn and take care of their own.""



Army 1st Sgt. Jay Shearer is Daniels’ company first sergeant. He says Daniels' performance over the past nine months has been nothing short of phenomenal. Shearer goes further to say that not only has Daniels’ vast knowledge benefited Regional Commands South and Southwest, but also the Afghan National Security Forces.



“His instruction of the blood program has expanded the knowledge of the Afghan flight medics and has paved the way forward for Afghanistan and their healthcare system,” said Shearer.

The plans will let around 600 interpreters who have worked on the front line for more than a year to relocate to Britain on a five-year visa. Those who do not meet the requirement will get a training and education package with the Afghan security forces and wages equivalent to their current salary.

Downing Street said Wednesday officials are expected to finalize them within days, though British media, quoting government sources, reported that the plans have already been approved.

A huge bravo to Lee Cataluna for having the courage to print the other side of the story regarding Monsanto (“Those wary of Monsanto’s aim should tour their property,” Star-Advertiser, Dec. 20).

Anti-GMO groups use intimidation and bullying to stifle the truth and get their way. Cataluna could have remained quiet. She spoke the truth because it was the right thing to do.

From the time that Monsanto acquired its Kunia property, it worked closely with the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii, spending more than $1 million and many man-hours to facilitate the adoption of 120 acres of the Honouliuli World War II internment site by the National Parks Service.

President Barack Obama officially proclaimed Honouliuli as a National Monument. Monsanto did not have to do this and did it with no publicity. Monsanto did it because it was the right thing to do.

Anti-GMO book might alter Cataluna’s views

Does Lee Cataluna think you can look at an ear of corn and know anything about the effects of genetic engineering?

Or listen to the paid programming of Monsanto employees and understand the science?

It’s probably too much to ask Cataluna to read something like “Altered Genes, Twisted Truth: How the Venture to Genetically Engineer Our Food Has Subverted Science, Corrupted Government, and Systematically Deceived the Public,” by Steven M. Druker.

If she were to, she might be a little less glib about “the hysterical distrust of science” and whether distrust of the genetic engineering project is “fearmongering,” “wildly untruthful” and “unproductive.”

Many rail riders will still have to catch buses

Many Ewa commuters will want to go to the University of Hawaii-Manoa or Waikiki, not downtown or Ala Moana, so with the current plans for rail transit, they eventually will have to transfer to a bus.

If we convert the rail guideways to bus guideways and end them at Middle Street or Iwilei, individual buses could continue on surface roads to various express destinations. Commuters could get over freeway bottlenecks and would have to catch only one express bus to do it.

Modern express buses are far more comfortable than many realize. Transit time for the existing express bus from Kapolei to Ala Moana is only about 10 minutes more than what is projected for the train, and the articulated buses currently on Honolulu roads have a capacity equal to the planned train cars.

This option could be both better and cheaper than rail. Both the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation and the Federal Transit Authority should consider it.

Seems like president took Gabbard’s advice

I have always had great respect for our U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Recently she said the United States should leave Syrian President Bashar Assad alone and let the local people handle the situation. America must stay out of changing other countries’ policies, whether democratic or not.

Look at what happened in Iraq, although its leader was insane. Now it appear that the White House is in agreement.

Good for Gabbard. I hope she keeps it up.

http://www.livemint.com/Politics/jMSmPsA7YXXJf7dQ2wcLrL/Suspected-US-drone-kills-1-in-Pakistan.html,Suspected US drone kills 1 in Pakistan,"Islamabad: A suspected US drone strike killed an alleged militant in Pakistan’s northwest tribal region, intelligence officials said on Friday, the latest indication Washington has no intention of throttling back its unmanned aircraft attacks despite increasing tension with Pakistan over the attacks.

The overnight strike targetted a house in Qazi Kot village in the North Waziristan tribal area, said Pakistani intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. A suspected member of Punjabi branch of the Pakistani Taliban was killed, they said.

The attack came a little over a day after a Pakistani political party revealed what it said was the name of the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) top spy in the country and called for him and the head of the agency to be tried for murder for a recent drone strike.

The party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, has also been trying to block trucks carrying North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troop supplies to and from neighbouring Afghanistan to protest drone attacks. Pakistan’s federal government has also been critical of the strikes, calling them a violation of the country’s sovereignty and saying they kill too many civilians. That has made the attacks widely unpopular among the Pakistani public.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif however has shown little interest in sparking a crisis with the US over drones. The issue is also clouded by the fact that Pakistan’s government and military is known to have supported at least some of the strikes in the past, and suspicion lingers that some level of complicity continues—although Islamabad denies the allegation.

The US rarely discusses the covert CIA drone program in Pakistan in public, but US officials have made clear that Washington views the attacks as a vital tool to target al-Qaida and Taliban militants in Pakistan who are outside the reach of American soldiers. The CIA has not confirmed whether the name revealed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Wednesday is actually the agency’s station chief in Islamabad.

It was the second time in recent years that Pakistanis opposed to drone strikes have claimed to reveal the identity of the top CIA spy in the country. In December 2010, the CIA pulled its top spy out of Pakistan after a lawsuit accused him of killing civilians in drone strikes. The Pakistani lawsuit listed a name lawyers said was the station chief, but the AP learned at the time it was not correct. Nevertheless, CIA pulled the station chief out of the country after militants threatened to kill him.

The drones have been a complicated issue for Pakistan’s powerful former army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, during the six years that he had led the force. The army held an elaborate ceremony on Friday marking the end of Kayani’s time as chief and the elevation of his successor, General Raheel Sharif. The culmination of the ceremony in the garrison city of Rawalpindi included Kayani handing over a wooden baton symbolizing the change of command.

The army is considered the most powerful institution in Pakistan, which has experienced three military coups, and Kayani has played a hugely influential role in the country. But unlike many of his predecessors, Kayani was publicly adamant that the army should not overtly interfere in politics.

That stance allowed Pakistan to experience its first successful transition between democratically elected governments earlier this year—although the army has continued to play a powerful political role in the background, especially regarding policy toward the Afghan war and Pakistan’s arch enemy India.

Retired army officers have said they expect the new army chief will largely continue the policies of his predecessor. Kayani was a critical figure for the US, which relies on Pakistan for support in battling Islamic militants and negotiating an end to the war in Afghanistan.

The US was initially heartened by Kayani’s appointment as army chief in 2007 because of his stated desire to stay out of politics. But the relationship between Kayani and his US counterparts eventually deteriorated, especially following the covert American raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Kayani and other officials were outraged by the operation because they were not told about it beforehand.

The relationship also faced constant strain because of US allegations that Pakistan’s army supported Afghan Taliban militants staging attacks against American troops in Afghanistan. Pakistan denied the allegations, but analysts widely believe the country has maintained its historical ties to the militants because it views them as potential allies in Afghanistan after foreign forces withdraw.

Kayani also faced a vicious insurgency by domestic Taliban militants that killed thousands of security personnel and civilians. The Afghan and Pakistani Taliban are allies, but have generally focused their attacks on opposite sides of the border.

Kayani launched scores of operations against the Pakistani Taliban in their sanctuaries in the northwest, but the attacks have continued. He refused US demands to target their final sanctuary in North Waziristan, a move that analysts say was driven by his desire not to cross Afghan militants based there with whom the army had ties.",Q1

“We have started an investigation to unearth facts whether the jirga issued a decree for the demand of Rs1 million from the bridegroom and if it was proved we would take to justice those involved in it,” Tasveer Shah, the SHO Balakot told reporters on Tuesday.

The best historical parallels — the 1998 cruise missile strikes on targets in Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan — are rife with unintended consequences and feature little success.

“The one thing we should learn is you can’t get a little bit pregnant,” said retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was at the helm of U.S. Central Command when the Pentagon launched cruise missiles at suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and weapons facilities in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. “If you do a one-and-done and say you’re going to repeat it if unacceptable things happen, you might find these people keep doing unacceptable things. It will suck you in.”

Images of the glassy-eyed corpses of civilians, including children, killed in last week's chemical attack in a Damascus suburb struck a powerful chord in Washington, where until now there has been little appetite for a military intervention. With U.S. Navy destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean, the White House is scrambling to assemble international support for a days-long bombing campaign targeting military sites, which appears to have robust support from Congress.

The United States has at best a mixed record of success with such operations. In late August 1998, the Pentagon fired cruise missiles at suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan and the pharmaceutical factory in Sudan that was presumed to be producing chemical weapons. The campaign, called Operation Infinite Reach, was in response to the bombings on Aug. 7, 1998, of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which were the first al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. targets.

The strikes in Afghanistan failed to kill al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or his top lieutenants. The one in Sudan became an embarrassment for the Pentagon because the intelligence that put a pharmaceutical factory on the target list turned out to be faulty.

In December of that year, the Clinton administration lobbed cruise missiles at military targets in Iraq in response to Hussein’s refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions that condemned Iraq’s weapons program.

Former U.S. officials said neither operation dealt much of a strategic setback to the targets. But they enraged many in the Muslim world, prompting angry demonstrations, including an attempted siege of the U.S. Embassy in Damascus by a mob that later ransacked the ambassador’s residence.

“We didn’t really gain anything,” said longtime U.S. diplomat Ryan C. Crocker, who was the ambassador in Damascus at the time. “The behavior of our adversaries did not change. A couple of cruise missiles are not going to change their way of thinking.”

With Congress in recess, the lead-up to a military strike on Syria has unfolded with relatively little substantive debate on Capitol Hill about the risks and merits of a cruise missile strike. Potential pitfalls include strengthening rebel factions aligned with al-Qaeda and triggering even more brutal attacks by the regime.

The limited debate about the anticipated operation in Syria has centered on questions of presidential powers.

After a few conservative Republicans insisted that the Obama administration needed congressional authorization before ordering a strike, House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) urged the White house to conduct “meaningful consultation with members of Congress” and articulate “clearly defined objectives” before giving the Pentagon the green light.

Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a frequent critic of President Obama, was one of at least 20 lawmakers who signed a letter written by Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) arguing that it would be illegal for the White House to authorize an attack on Syria without a congressional sign-off.

A swift military response is justified if the United States faces an imminent threat, Rigell said in an interview. But the situation in Syria “is not that circumstance,” he argued, adding, “A threat is not imminent.”

Lawmakers have often been quick to back military interventions begun in response to the type of international outrage sparked by Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons last week, the first major nerve gas attack in more than 25 years.

“When there is a humanitarian disaster, people want to see something happen,” Zinni said. “You’ll knee-jerk into the first option, blowing something up, without thinking through what this could lead to.”

In an operation some policy analysts have used as a template, the United States and NATO allies started a bombing campaign in 1999 in an effort to stop ethnic cleansing and drive Serbian forces from Kosovo. American diplomat Christopher R. Hill, who was dispatched as a special envoy to Kosovo, said there was an expectation that U.S. military intervention would be short and decisive. Some thought the bombing campaign would last a few days, Hill said, but it dragged on for 78.

“The problem is that people expect when U.S. military assets are deployed that we will do so until the regime goes away,” he said.

Hill said he understands and supports the White House’s desire to launch a strike, but with a major caveat.

“The problem with Syria is that it’s bombing in the absence of a political plan,” said Hill, who worries that the government of President Bashar al-Assad could respond with even more chemical attacks. “I think we’re opening a big door. Every time you drop bombs on something, you can’t entirely predict the results.”

Christopher Harmer, a former Navy planner who is an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said a quick military campaign that is not accompanied by a clear end goal is a terrible idea.

""Conducting a punitive attack that does not fundamentally alter the balance of power is in my opinion worse than doing nothing,"" said Harmer, who last month drafted a report outlining how cruise missile strikes could degrade Syria's air force and air defenses. U.S. bombs raining down on Damascus could boost Assad's standing, giving credence that the war he is waging is one against external threats.",Q1

NEW DELHI: The establishment of war-torn Afghanistan's first agriculture university with India's help in the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar is a breakthrough in Indo-Afghan strategic partnership, external affairs minister Salman Khurshid has said.""For India, a strong, prosperous and economically independent Afghanistan is a strategic priority and a key element of our Strategic Partnership Agreement,"" said Khurshid, who returned last night from Kandahar after inaugurating the Afghan National Agricultural Sciences and Technology University (ANASTU) in the sprawling Tarnak farm.""We, therefore, see our participation in this Agriculture University project as an important activity of the India- Afghanistan strategic partnership,"" he said.Interestingly, the Tarnak farm was al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden's main Afghan residence during much of the late 1990s. From there he oversaw al-Qaeda's plot to fly hijacked airliners into the World Trade Centre in New York and Pentagon in Washington in an attack that killed nearly 3,000 people.Khurshid noted that India has already offered 614 agricultural scholarships for Afghan students who are presently being trained at Indian agriculture institutes. He hoped that many of those being trained in India would one day return as professors to ANASTU in which India has invested up to $8 million.About 80 per cent of Afghan people depends on agriculture for livelihood. Also, nearly 60 per cent of GDP of the country is from the farm sector which still lacks modern agriculture practices.Khurshid said Afghan President Hamid Karzai treats the agriculture university as an ""extremely important legacy issue for him.""The Karzai government has transferred to the university 2,810 acres of land with irrigation facilities.""Generally it is a very breakthrough step that we have been able to take up in Afghanistan. It is a small beginning because it is a very difficult place both in terms of connectivity and safety and communications,"" he said.Khurshid is the first external affairs minister to visit Kandahar, the second largest city in Afghanistan, since 1999 when the then minister Jaswant Singh came with three terrorists released in exchange for the hostages of a hijacked Indian Airlines flight.The plane was hijacked during its flight from Kathmandu to Delhi on December 24 and the crisis ended with the hostages being released on January 1, 2000 in exchange for terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar, Omar Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar.In his speech at the inauguration of ANASTU yesterday, Khurshid recalled that Jaswant Singh had visited the city in ""very difficult, different circumstances"".""I recall that in 1999, my predecessor came to Kandahar in very difficult, very different circumstances,"" he said.""So I think, all in all, it was important, critical. He (Karzai) wanted to do it before he lays down office and was very glad that I was able to come,"" Khurshid said.Afghanistan is set to hold presidential election on April 5 ahead of the drawdown of US-led troops later this year.Earlier, speaking to Indian reporters in Kandahar, Karzai said the opening of the agriculture university was a ""significant"" event in Afghanistan's history.""India has taken yet one more significant step in helping Afghanistan,"" he said, noting that India had given aid worth $2 billion though it is not a traditional donor.",Q1
http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/05/20/wiki-m20.html,Why the SEP does not endorse the WikiLeaks Party,"WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange has launched a new party ahead of the federal election in Australia on September 14. From the Ecuadorian embassy in London—where he remains under siege by the British authorities, who are denying his democratic right to accept political asylum in the South American state—Assange is heading a slate of Senate candidates for Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia.

At a time of widespread disgust with the major political parties among ordinary working people, the WikiLeaks Party (WLP) is appealing to growing anti-establishment sentiment that finds no expression whatsoever within the major parliamentary parties. Assange is regarded as a courageous figure for his role in exposing thousands of documents detailing US killings of civilians and complicity in torture in Afghanistan, along with numerous other crimes previously hidden from the world’s population.

The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) has opposed the efforts of the Obama administration, assisted by the Labor government in Australia, to railroad Assange into jail through baseless sexual misconduct allegations in Sweden and an espionage case being prepared in Washington. We have sought to mobilise the working class in Australia and internationally against his persecution.

However our long-standing defence of Assange against a state frame-up does not obligate us to support his senate candidacy or his newly formed political party.

Principled socialist politics is not based on personalities but on the interests of the working class. We evaluate parties and the candidates who represent them on the basis of their political history, program and class orientation. Proceeding from these criteria, political support cannot be extended by the SEP to the WikiLeaks Party, which has been formed around Julian Assange’s person. To the extent that the WLP has attempted to formulate its programmatic demands, it remains within the framework of bourgeois-reformist parliamentary politics.

Julian Assange has played an important role as a journalist and whistle blower. His political conceptions and activities are another matter. Assange’s politics are an eclectic combination of libertarianism and reformism. However sincere his intentions, Assange’s political associations have been all over the map and reveal a man whose decisions are influenced by impressionism, naiveté and short-sighted opportunism.

Within Australia, Assange has sought to cultivate relations with elements of the political establishment, such as the WLP’s campaign director and most prominent spokesperson, Greg Barns, a barrister and former senior advisor to the conservative Liberal-National government of John Howard.

As for the structure of the WLP, office holders and members of the new party include a wildly heterogeneous political mixture of disaffected Liberals, and libertarians and various currents of middle-class protest politics. While the WLP is yet to announce its full slate of senate candidates, its national council comprises Assange’s family members and former colleagues, activists with the WikiLeaks Australian Citizens Alliance, lawyer and human rights advocate Kellie Tranter, peace campaigner Gail Malone, Aboriginal educational consultant Luke Pearson, and Omar Todd, a filmmaker and activist with the anti-whaling Sea Shepherd group.

The party is yet to issue a program. Its constitution outlines several reformist objectives, including “promoting transparency of governmental action, policy and information [and] transparency of corporations’ and non-government organisations’ actions, information and policies”, and “ensuring that governments, corporations, entities, associations, trade unions and the persons associated with such bodies, such as politicians and corporate executives, are held accountable for their policies and actions.”

According to one account of a discussion with Assange earlier this year, the WikiLeaks’ editor believes that if he is elected to the Australian senate then the US Grand Jury espionage case against him will be dropped, because “the US Department of Justice won’t want to spark an international diplomatic row.” He likewise believes that the British government would capitulate on its Swedish extradition threat, because “the political costs of the current standoff will be higher still.”

If this is, indeed, the basis of Assange’s decision to run for parliament, then he has apparently learned very little from his own experiences. Far from the Australian parliament becoming the vehicle for his exoneration and release, it has been, and will remain, a vital cog in the conspiracy against him. The Obama administration is determined to make an example out of Assange, declared a “high tech terrorist” by Vice President Joe Biden, to intimidate all opponents to US imperialism. No-one within the administration will give a second thought to any “senator elect” status that Assange may be able to claim after September 14. Washington’s contempt for diplomatic norms, and for the Australian parliament, was made perfectly clear in the leaked cables released by WikiLeaks itself.

In the course of our federal election campaign, the Socialist Equality Party will continue to fight unequivocally for the defence of Julian Assange. We will do so on the basis of our struggle to develop an independent and unified political movement of the working class, directed at the overthrow of the capitalist profit system. That is the only viable way to advance the struggle for democratic rights.

A co-worker said they died trying to protect firefighters by removing ammunition and propane tanks from their home and loading them into their car.

The victims were identified by the El Paso County Sheriff’s office as Marc Allen Herklotz, 52, and his wife, Robin Lauran Herklotz, 50.

Their bodies were found in the garage of their home on Jicarilla Drive in Black Forest, near the area where investigators believe the fire began. Officials said the doors of their car were open and it appeared they were trying to evacuate. The home sat on a heavily wooded 2.6-acre lot, according to county records.

Investigators spoke to someone who talked to the victims by phone at about 5 p.m. on June 11, just hours after the fire started, Sheriff Terry Maketa said last week. In the background of the phone call, the person could hear popping sounds.

“All indications on scene is that they were planning on leaving quickly,” Maketa said.

Neighbors Bob and Barbara Schmidt told The Associated Press that they last saw the Herklotzes about 4:35 p.m. The Schmidts said the Herklotzes told them they had not received an automated evacuation call but were packing and “they’d leave when they needed to.”

Identification of the bodies was difficult because the fire burned for several days in that area at about 2,500 degrees, Maketa said Tuesday. The bodies were identified through a cooperative effort by the El Paso County coroner’s office and a forensic dentist.

Sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Jeff Kramer said investigators have learned little about the circumstances of the couple’s deaths.

“The coroner had very little in the way of remains to work with,” he said.

James Wing, a co-worker and friend of the couple, described them as happy and inseparable.

“It’s a small consolation for those that knew them that they were together in the end, but it would not have been a small consolation to them,” Wing said.

Wing said Marc was a radio-control enthusiast like his father, and had rare and impressive model airplanes hanging in his office where he worked writing intelligence software for the Air Force.

In their death, Wing said he learned the couple was thinking of the safety of firefighters first, likely causing them to take too long to evacuate when the fire was approaching.

“Marc was a shooting enthusiast and he had lots of ammunition and also propane tanks,” Wing said. “A neighbor saw them loading them, trying to remove all of it, so that it wouldn’t pose a danger to firefighters.”

A son of the couple is on tour in Afghanistan, Wing said.

An Air Force news release said Marc Herklotz served in the Air Force from 1983-87 and worked as a civilian employee in the Innovation Division of Space Command’s Air, Space and Cyberspace Operations Directorate. Robin Herklotz was an Air Force contractor.

“Both were longtime members of Air Force Space Command, supporting critical air, space and cyberspace operational missions from offices on Schriever Air Force Base,” the release said.

The fire began at about 2 p.m. on June 11 in Black Forest north of Colorado Springs, and it quickly raced through ponderosa pine and shrub oak.

It has burned 14,280 acres and destroyed 509 homes. Maketa said there are still 937 homes and 9,830 acres under the mandatory evacuation order. About 2,600 people remain out of their homes; at the high point of the fire, almost 40,000 people were evacuated.

As of Tuesday evening, the fire was 85 percent contained.

As people return, Maketa said to remember those who no longer have homes.

“We need to not lose sight of those who lost every memory they ever created,” he said.

The cause of the fire has not been determined. Maketa has said investigators believe it was human-caused and are narrowing in on a point of origin. He said Tuesday that area is 40 feet square.

“It’s certainly something you do not rush,” Maketa said. “It is important to determine if the fire was caused accidentally or intentionally.”

The sheriff’s office Tuesday downgraded additional mandatory evacuation areas, allowing residents like Robert Runyard to go home for the first time in a week.

Runyard is admittedly sentimental, but he held his cool as he bounded down the winding roads of Black Forest for his first glimpse of the rubble and wreckage he once called home.

The skeletal trees and charred rolling hills offered further proof of what he already knew: The house on Swan Road had become part of the landscape. A lone brick wall, streaked black with smoke, jutted out like a beacon.

“This is my neighborhood,” he said. “What a mess.”

Camera in hand and girlfriend Amy Feik by his side, he took stock of the remains: a pile of blackened nails from inside a melted bucket, a motorcycle helmet that crumbled at the touch, a Subaru station wagon, mangled and gutted.

“My first souvenir!” Runyard said, grabbing its license plate from the ground. The numbers had burned off.

But, at least for the moment, Runyard didn’t flinch. The veteran was “back in battle mode.”

“I saw parts of Kuwait like this,” he said, sifting through the ashes of his two-story barn. He’d lived in the home since 1986. He designed it himself and made many upgrades.

“I’ll cry when you leave,” he said.

The couple wandered further into the disorienting landscape. They uncovered the twisted remains of rifles, a battered washing machine.

“The wheelbarrow is still there!” Feik yelled.

“This is the hose!” Runyard shouted.

“Oh my God, do you remember when I took a pottery class and made a little bowl?” Feik said pulling it from the rubble. Later, a shattered coffee mug made her smile.

“Every object you find has a story,” Runyard said. “Some of the things I thought would survive the fire didn’t, but I guess that’s not surprising.”

http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/opinion/05-Feb-2014/pak-us-strategic-dialogue,Pak-US strategic dialogue,"In the post 9/11-phase, it is the year 2014 that is bound to test the veracity of the oft repeated and oft eulogised “strong relationship and enduring partnership” between Pakistan and the US. On January 27, the advisor to the prime minister of Pakistan on national security and foreign affairs, Sartaj Aziz, and US Secretary of State John Kerry met in Washington for the ministerial meeting of the Pak-US strategic dialogue and issued a joint statement. This round of dialogue was the first one after the dialogue process that began in 2010 stalled in 2011 in the wake of the Abbottabad raid. The dialogue focused on five areas, which were dealt with by establishing working groups: first came energy, second security, strategic stability and nonproliferation, third the defence consultative group, fourth law enforcement and counterterrorism, and fifth was economics and finance. As per the joint statement, meetings of the first three working groups have already been convened in late 2013.

Out of these five areas, the first (energy) and the fifth (economics and finance) are those where Pakistan is in immediate need of help. That is, Pakistan requires sufficient energy to run its industries and ease the lives of its people from the clutches of load shedding. Similarly, if not aid, Pakistan requires trade and foreign investment to strengthen its foreign reserves and economy. The US might have added 1,000 megawatts of electricity to Pakistan’s national grid system but neither has there taken place any considerable development in offering export opportunities to Pakistani exporters nor has there been any substantial foreign investment by US investors in Pakistan. Nevertheless, these are the two areas that are pushing Pakistan to listen to the US in the other areas.

The common thread that runs through the other three areas is terrorism (or how to deal with terrorism) but the adjunct is the word ‘nuclear’. This is where the word ‘shared’ (emphasised by both countries in their joint statement) is relevant. The word ‘shared’ is not devoid of (diplomatic) connotations, ranging from “the US wants Pakistan to look after its own security strategies, whether inside the country or in the region, in a certain way” to “Pakistan is enmeshed in a security crisis (whether internal or external) and yearns for an outsider’s help.” Apparently ‘terrorism’ is a simple word but when it is seen in the context of a country having nuclear weapons, the concern of anyone becomes serious. The added urgency sprouts from the history of nuclear proliferation. The way terrorism is taking over Pakistan, anyone could become apprehensive of any untoward incident, which may bring the words ‘terrorism’ and ‘nuclear’ closer to each other. This is the point where Pakistan has been feeling trapped.

Pakistan feels trapped because the US has declined to embrace it into its nuclear energy fold, like the one offered by the US to India in 2008 through the 123 Agreement. It is now obvious that the US is ready to help Pakistan in any energy harnessing domain except nuclear. Secondly, it is also obvious that the US is unwilling to give any impression of legitimacy to Pakistan’s nuclear status. Nevertheless, even if nuclear proliferation is the reason for turning down Pakistan’s request for entering into a similar 123 Agreement, the US has not articulated in how many years Pakistan will be able to prove its nuclear nonproliferation resolve. This is the point where the blackmailing option enters the scene. If the US is such a partner and enjoys such a strategic, shared vision with Pakistan, should Pakistan be subjected to any kind of nuclear blackmail, which may be implicit, if not explicit? Pakistan does not deserve this kind of treatment.

In the joint statement, hidden in the sentence “cross-border militancy is a serious threat to both Pakistan and Afghanistan” is the point that the agents of instability and disruption are common in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Nevertheless, it is now obvious that Pakistan has inched closer to fighting its part in the war on terror (or its part in the hammer-and-anvil operation). It is because the situation has reached the point where Pakistan has to prove that it takes care not only of its own security but also of the (part of the) region affected by its strategies. Secondly, it is also because Pakistan has to prove that it is a country that takes care of its nuclear assets on its own and does not need any help from an outsider.

If the direction of cross-border militancy is supposed to be from Pakistan to Afghanistan, the former has to show that it is not exporting militancy. The ripe time for Pakistan’s coming into action may be in March. This is because there is a direct relationship between such cross-border militancy and the bleak chances of the smooth conduct of the presidential elections in Afghanistan in April. The success of these elections and that of the ensuing transition of power are not only vital to the future of Afghanistan but are also important to vindicate the worth of the efforts of the US-NATO forces in Afghanistan in the past decade. On the other hand, if the direction of cross-border militancy is supposed from Afghanistan to Pakistan, the latter has to show that it cannot be overrun by the agents of militancy.

In a way, the Pakistan of today is trapped between two forces: first, those who are seeing the future of nuclear capability of Pakistan with doubt and, secondly, those who are inflicting acts of militancy (or terrorism) on Pakistan. Every single act of terrorism launched by the latter brings Pakistan one step closer to get entangled with the former. The earlier Pakistan realises this drift, the better it is. Nonetheless, the future of Pak-US strategic dialogue hinges on the future of Afghanistan. The scepticism of the US about the role of Pakistan in Afghanistan is the major hindrance in the way of Pak-US cooperation in the area of trade and investment.

http://www.nj.com/washington-township-times/index.ssf/2013/11/veterans_honored_for_service_s.html,"Veterans honored for service, sacrifice at Washington Township schools","From the seas of the South Pacific to the deserts of Afghanistan, local veterans who fought on battlefields around the world gathered at Chestnut Ridge Middle School in Washington Township on Monday morning, part of the district's Veterans Day festivities.

“We feel veterans have sacrificed so much for all of us, for our freedoms and our rights, and it’s our duty to honor them,” said Linda Martin, team leader of the middle school’s Shining Stars team, which organized a special breakfast and assembly for the veterans.

The breakfast prior to the assembly — where the veterans spoke about their service and the students read essays about what their sacrifices mean to them — dates back to the school’s beginnings in 1989.

Then, Martins said, it started with just one veteran — Vietnam veteran Joe Rullo — who is joined by friends and fellow veterans who Martins said are now “like family.”

Weeks before the assembly, students learned about veterans in a range of interdisciplinary subjects, she said, from reading and writing about them to using coordinate points to mathematically draw a picture of a veteran.

“[The students] love it,” Martins said. “They’re very respectful.”

After the school’s band and choir played patriotic tunes during the assembly, each veteran spoke briefly about his service.

“We’re proud to be veterans and honored we had a chance to serve,” said Bob Abbott, chairman of the township’s Veterans Advisory Board and member of the Board of Education. “[Veterans Day] is a celebration, a time you can come out and say ‘Gee, thanks.’”

It’s especially important to Vietnam veterans, Abbott said, who were “dishonored in every way possible” when they returned home.

“Things have changed and we can thank God for that,” Abbott said.

Other attendees included Bill Braker, a paratrooper during the Korean War and Russ Price, who was in the Army during World War II and spent six months in Europe before V-J day sent him home. Veteran Ed Lonegan, who served in the Air Force in France and England during the Vietnam War, was new to the event, after his granddaughter, a student, asked if he could come and be honored as well.

Larry Silverman, who served as a lance corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps in Vietnam, said it’s about helping the students understand exactly what it means to serve in the Armed Forces, for both veterans and the civilians they’re fighting to protect.

“A lot of people don’t understand,” Silverman said. “They don’t respect veterans.” Even for him, reaction is mixed when he goes out in public. When some spot his Vietnam veterans hat, he receives warm gratitude, while at other times it’s just a side-eyed glance of judgment, he said.

To help the newest generations understand veterans' sacrifices, U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Ray Sambor said he directs the students’ questions away from morbid curiosity and video game-centric ideas of war. He said he relishes the chance to tell them about his love for his career, and the seriousness of veterans' sacrifices.

“It’s about doing a job and completing your mission,” Sambor said. “It’s not a video game, it’s not Call of Duty where you get three lives and you come back.”

Meanwhile on Monday, students at the district’s Orchard Valley Middle School got the promised reward from their month of fundraising for a veterans’ charity, when teacher Bob Rourke got his beard partially shaved off by colleague Chris Janeczko during the morning announcements. Broadcast to the entire school, the shaving was a part of “Mustaches for Veterans,” a friendly competition Janeczko thought up as a way to raise money for Homes for Our Troops, a non-profit organization that builds specially adapted homes for disabled veterans.

Teachers grew out mustaches, and the class that collected the most money won the chance to see their teacher given a unique shave.

“I though it’d be a fun kind of thing,” said Janeczko.

“It gets the kids into it,” Rourke added. “They were constantly threatening to put $20 bills in. We had fun with it.”

And for the partially-shaved goatee combo he had to sport all day — he didn’t mind, much.

“It’s a little embarrassing,” he said. “But it’s for a good cause.”

Addressing a press conference at the Pentagon, Little said US and coalition military leaders ""remain very confident in the growing capabilities of the Afghan national security forces.""

Noting that enemy attacks are a part of war, he said: ""We know that we have to continue to pursue our campaign as a war effort.""

Although he acknowledged that Afghan security forces suffered casualties in the recent militant attacks, Little stressed that the Afghan forces have taken the fight to the Taliban and are ""in this to win it.""

""We believe progress in the war effort continues. The fact remains that the Taliban have not been able to seize back territory that they once had -- and that's just one indicator of the progress we've made in Afghanistan,"" he added.

Currently, there are over 100,000 foreign troops from more than 48 countries in Afghanistan to contain the Taliban insurgency. The U.S. remains the single biggest contributor to the ISAF, with 68,000 soldiers on the ground.

The US and other allied nations involved in the Afghan mission are currently making efforts to get Afghan security forces ready and capable of handling the country's security before the planned withdrawal of coalition troops by end 2014.

The NATO-led coalition force has already begun the process of entrusting security responsibilities of several provinces to Afghan forces. However, there are wide concerns about the ability of Afghan security forces to counter Taliban insurgency without the same level of foreign military assistance and presence.

Dallen Atack said the Utah National Guard’s top priority has always been and always will be taking care of soldiers and their families while they’re away.

“We’ll always look at our deployed soldiers and their families as our number one priority -- so that is not going to be affected,” Atack said. “We are going to take care of those families above all else, but it does put an extra burden on those families in those outlying armories.”

Atack testified before a legislative committee Tuesday that 181 of the Utah Guard’s 252 civilian employees have been furloughed because of the government shutdown.

While the government says it will reimburse the Utah Guard for the costs of operation and maintenance, employees who have been sent home won’t be getting paid.

“We know that we're going to have a number if families that will struggle, just like anybody would, if you went two weeks and didn't receive a paycheck,” Atack said.

Despite cuts, Atack said, the most important thing for people to know is that the national guard will continue to stand ready to serve all the needs of its citizens.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/07/pervez-musharraf-pakistan-election,Pervez Musharraf approved to run in Pakistan election,"Pakistan's former military ruler General Pervez Musharraf has been given approval to run for parliament in a remote northern district after being rejected in two other parts of the country, his aide said.

Rashid Qureshi said election officials in Chitral, near the Afghan border, had accepted Musharraf's nomination papers.

Musharraf, who seized power in a military coup in 1999 and was forced to step down nearly a decade later, returned to Pakistan from exile last month to run for the national assembly.

The elections on 11 May will mark the first transition between two democratically elected governments in the 65-year history of Pakistan, a country that has experienced three military coups and constant political instability.

Musharraf's two other applications to run in districts in southern and central Pakistan were rejected, and a third in Islamabad is pending.

Opponents have filed objections based on actions he took while ruling Pakistan. His opponents allege that he violated the constitution by overthrowing an elected government in 1999, was involved in the killing of a nationalist leader, ousted superior judiciary judges and ordered a raid against a mosque in downtown Islamabad that had become a sanctuary for militants.

Election commission officials could not be reached for comment to explain why Musharraf was being allowed to run in one constituency after being rejected in two others.

A judge rejected Musharraf's candidacy in an area of Karachi after Musharraf failed to appear before the court to respond to objections raised by his opponents. His lawyer, Shafiq Ahmad, told the court that Musharraf would appeal.

Musharraf landed in Karachi on 24 March after more than four years in self-exile. The outgoing Zardari government forced him to step down in August 2008.

Musharraf is viewed as an enemy by many Islamic militants and others for his decision to side with the US in the response to the 9/11 attacks. The Pakistani Taliban have threatened to kill him.

Musharraf also faces legal charges, including some originating from an investigation into the 2007 assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.",Q1

Lance Corporal Liam Culverhouse lost his right eye in the shootings at an Afghan National Police checkpoint in Nad-e-Ali, Helmand province, in November 2009.

Five of his comrades were killed in the attack.

Eighteen months after returning home, Culverhouse assaulted his then seven-week-old daughter Khloe Abrams at the family home in Northampton, leaving her fighting for her life in hospital for nearly 18 months.

Today at Nottingham Crown Court, Culverhouse, who was medically discharged from the Army in April, pleaded guilty to causing or allowing the death of the toddler.

Khloe was admitted to Northampton General Hospital on May 8, 2011 with severe injuries.

She never recovered and died at the Rainbow Children's Hospice in Loughborough on November 7 last year.

In a statement Northamptonshire Police said: ""Khloe Abrams died at the Rainbow Children's Hospice in Loughborough on November 7, 2012. She was 19 months old.

""Khloe died as a result of a severe trauma following an assault which took place in May 2011 when she was seven weeks old.""

Culverhouse, of Kingsthorpe, Northampton, appeared in the dock at Nottingham Crown Court today alongside his former partner, Khloe's mother Clare Abrams.

Wearing a black suit with blue shirt and tie, he showed no emotion during the hearing.

Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, told the court Culverhouse had pleaded guilty ""to causing or allowing the death of Khloe Abrams under the heading of causing the death of Khloe Abrams"".

She added: ""Mr Culverhouse is accepting that he is responsible for the unlawful act that caused the death of the child.""

No details of the assault were heard in court.

Miss Abrams, wearing a black suit and pink top, pleaded not guilty to the joint charge of causing or allowing the death of her daughter.

After a review of the evidence, Miss Abrams, of Lloyd Road, Abington, Northampton, was cleared of the charge.

Miss Howes said: ""The Crown would offer no evidence against Miss Abrams in relation to these counts and invite a verdict of not guilty.""

David Howell, defending Culverhouse, told the court his client was an ex-member of the military who had suffered extensive injuries as a result of operational service in Afghanistan in 2009, including the loss of his right eye.

Culverhouse was granted bail to allow him to receive rehabilitation support, the court heard.

Adjourning the hearing for pre-sentence and medical reports, the judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told Culverhouse: ""Please understand, and I am sure you do, it is extremely likely you will be facing a significant custodial sentence when you return to court.""

David Howell, defending the soldier, said: “He is an ex-member of the military and has extensive injuries as a result of operational service where he was shot in the right eye.

“He is still undergoing rehabilitation, and was medically discharged in April this year.”

Mr Howell added he would be referring to ‘regimental reports’ including medical evidence when Culverhouse is sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court in December.",Q1

Taxpayers are shelling out £77million a year on work-related compensation for NHS workers

Ministry of Defence spends just £44million a year on injured servicemen

A hospital chief executive has been paid almost half a million pounds in compensation after he fainted in his office and claimed he could no longer work because of stress.



Roger Tarver, 68, was awarded a £370,000 lump sum – plus £24,000 a year for life – after claiming the stress of the job left him psychologically scarred and damaged his heart.



His payout from an official NHS compensation scheme for work-related injuries dwarfs that given to many soldiers who have sustained horrendous battlefield wounds fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.



Compensation: Government figures show that the Department of Health in England is currently paying out £47million a year under the NHS Injury Benefits Scheme, to 8,000 former employees who were injured before 1997

The case illustrates just how generously NHS employees are treated after claiming they cannot work, compared to servicemen who receive a medical discharge.



Taxpayers are shelling out £77 million a year on work-related compensation for doctors, nurses, hospital managers and other NHS staff in England, The Mail on Sunday has found.



By comparison the Ministry of Defence's spend on injured servicemen, through the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, is just £44million a year.



Campaigners last night said the figures, and Mr Tarver's case in particular, showed how soldiers' lives were regarded as 'cheap'.



Mr Tarver, former chief executive of City Hospital in Birmingham, is being paid under the NHS Injury Benefits Scheme.

Described as 'the best-kept secret in the NHS' by health unions, it gives payments of up to 85 per cent of a claimant's final salary every year for life, if their ability to work has been impaired.

Mr Tarver was medically retired in 1996, aged 51, months after collapsing in his office. He was taken to the cardiac unit with a racing pulse and later diagnosed with acute stress and heart problems.

He retired on his NHS pension but in 2009 won a claim under the injury benefits scheme, for £370,550 to be paid retrospectively, plus £24,000 a year for life.



By comparison, Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson was initially offered just £152,000 plus a £19,000-a-year pension after he lost both legs in an Afghanistan landmine explosion in 2006.



His mother Diane Dernie, who fought a successful campaign to more than triple his payout, last night criticised the disparity between the sums given to NHS staff and servicemen.



She said: 'The figures are pretty indicative of the way that soldiers' lives are held to be cheap.'



Mr Tarver yesterday defended his payout, but agreed many would think it unfair compared to those awarded to many soldiers.



Speaking from his detached home in Dorridge, West Midlands, he said: 'I don't think my payment was generous – I worked bloody hard for the NHS for 30-odd years.



'The job was impossible. It was daft. I had to make decisions that resulted in patients dying, like who can have the intensive care bed.



'I was in a position of having to act as God. Would you want that?'



Asked if his payout was unfair compared to those paid to many soldiers, he said: 'I agree – but I don't negotiate the conditions of service.'



Government figures show that the Department of Health in England is currently paying out £47 million a year under the NHS Injury Benefits Scheme, to 8,000 former employees who were injured before 1997.

That puts the annual average award at £5,875 – more than twice the average annual payment under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme of £2,750, once lump sums are factored in.



But the true annual cost of the NHS scheme to the taxpayers is likely to be a quarter higher, at almost £59 million, because when post-1997 claims are included the number of cases still being paid increases by 25 per cent to 10,129.



Further costs: Every year about 1,800 former health workers receive £18million in one-off compensation payments outside the government's existing scheme, raising the total annual payout to £77million

In addition, every year about 1,800 former health workers receive another £18 million in one-off compensation payments outside the scheme.



That puts the total annual compensation figure for NHS staff in England alone at £77 million.



The NHS Injury Benefits Scheme was replaced in April with a far less generous version called the NHS Injury Allowance Scheme.



The main difference is that payments are limited to a year's salary per incident. But because the original scheme pays out for life, huge sums will continue to be paid for years to come.

Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said Parliament needed to examine whether the military covenant – the agreement under which the state pledges to look after its servicemen – was being upheld 'not just in spirit but in action'.



He added: 'The Government wants to make sure we give priority to our servicemen, particularly to those who are injured and put their lives on the line.



'With the best will in the world, that's not what NHS people do.'



A Department of Health spokesman said the injury benefits scheme had been scrapped because it was 'archaic and expensive'.



An MoD spokesman said: 'We are committed to making sure that those injured as a result of their service get all the financial and welfare support they need.'

The Chancellor’s father-in-law put the Howell into “howler” last week by describing the North-east as “desolate” during a debate on gas fracking.



What he meant was there was plenty of land for fracking without it impacting on highly populated areas. What he said came out as an insult to the residents of one of the most breathtakingly beautiful parts of our country. Two days of uproar and one apology later, Lord Howell compounded the blunder by explaining his “stupid error” was saying the North-east when he meant the North-west.



The most memorable Westminster gaffes are those which serve to reinforce public prejudice about the political class (“they are out of touch, in it for themselves” etc). With a single word, Lord Howell has torpedoed Tory attempts to fight off perceptions of a party dominated by a metropolitan London elite running government for the sole benefit of the South-east.



Just last month Conservative MPs and campaigners launched Renewal, a group designed to appeal to parts of the country which felt overlooked by the Tories. This includes union members, two million of whom voted Tory in 2010, public sector workers and voters in the North whose support is vital if the party is to secure a majority in 2015.



One supporter of Renewal grumbled in private that Howell’s blunder would come back to bite the party “again and again on the doorstep”. No one at Conservative campaign headquarters can take comfort that this unfortunate slip will be forgotten any time soon.



The most toxic political gaffes are harder to shake off than a pitbull’s jaws. The Tory Party is still trying to climb out from under the “nasty party” shadow Theresa May so helpfully threw it under as its newly appointed chairwoman in 2002. As a Home Secretary Mrs May has proved one of the most surefooted and capable in recent history but even Mr Magoo could have seen this scripted phrase would backfire faster than a rusty musket.



Language can be such a minefield for politicians that sometimes even what you don’t say can harm you. Consider those words never quite uttered by Labour’s former defence secretary John Reid about getting British soldiers out of Afghanistan “without a single shot being fired”.



As he committed 3,300 troops to Afghanistan’s Helmand province in 2006, Dr Reid actually said: “We would be perfectly happy to leave in three years and without firing one shot, because our job is to protect the reconstruction.”



Yet it joins a rich pantheon of famous misquotes from “play it again, Sam” to “elementary, my dear Watson” and “the white heat of technology”. In the case of “Pleb-gate”, it was not whether former chief whip Andrew Mitchell actually hurled this insult at police officers that mattered, it was the public readiness to believe him capable of doing so.



Ultimately no one is immune from the gaffe trap, not even prime ministers. In recent years two have fallen victim to that new breed of political howler, the microphone gaffe. In 1993 former Tory PM John Major had just finished an interview with then ITN political editor Michael Brunson over a series of bruising internal battles over Europe (what else?). Thinking the microphone was off, Major slammed Cabinet colleagues as “bastards” and promised to “crucify” them.",Q1

Abdul Malik/Reuters

A top policewoman in southern Afghanistan has died after being shot by unknown attackers, months after her predecessor was slain under similar circumstances. Her death is the latest of a string of attacks on prominent Afghan women.

Sub-inspector Negar, who like many Afghans goes by one name, was outside her home buying grass for her lambs Sunday when two gunmen drove up on a motorbike and shot her in the neck, said Omar Zawak, a spokesman for the governor of the southern province of Helmand.

Doctors tried to save her, but she died early Monday, police spokesman Fareed Ahmad Obaidi said. Zawak also confirmed her death.

Kandahar government spokesman Javid Faisal told Al Jazeera that Negar believed that what she was doing was important for all women in Helmand.

""She was considered the most effective female police commander in the province, and she believed her duty was the most crucial and most important for women in Helmand province,"" Faisal said.

He also said that insurgents and extremists are against women's rights and women's independence in the country.

Another policewoman, Malalai, who also goes by one name, told The Associated Press that extremists ""have given us warning that one of us will be killed every three months and we will be killed one by one.""

Malalai did not say who was behind the killing, but the Taliban are believed to be behind many of the recent assaults on Afghan women. The insurgents have not claimed responsibility for the attack on Negar, and a Taliban spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Officials have given different ages for Negar, including 35 and 38, and varying accounts of her work history.

http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/50020/,"‘Article 226 makes it clear that all elections, except for PM and Ms, would be held by secret ballot’","ISLAMABAD (APP): The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday adjourned hearing in a presidential reference seeking opinion on open balloting for the upcoming Senate elections till Thursday.

A five-member larger bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mushir Alam, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi heard the reference.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, while continuing his arguments, said the Constitution did not mention the procedure for the election of NA speaker and deputy speaker and Senate chairman and deputy chairman.

The house officials conducted the elections where the Constitution did not specify the procedure, he said. The outgoing speaker served as returning officer for the election of the next one, he added.

He said the elections whose procedure was stipulated in the Constitution, would be considered under the Constitution.

The Constitution called for the creation of national and provincial assemblies, he added.

Justice Ijaz observed that the court understood the crux of his argument that the Constitution called to form offices and bodies, but the method of their election was in the law not in the Constitution.

The AGP said the offices of national and provincial assemblies were not constituted under the Constitution but under the law. The Constitution provided their composition, but laws and acts had been made for their elections, he added.

He said the duration of the parliament, the modus operandi, the number of sittings, etcetera were stated but the Constitution did not specify the procedure for the elections.

He said only the number of elected representatives was mentioned in the Constitution, but laws and acts were made for their election by the constituents.

The AGP said the number of special seats for women and minority and full composition of the parliament were provided in the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz asked how the elections were held for the women reserved seats.

The AGP replied that women seats were allocated by the winning ratio of the political parties. It was written in the Constitution that the National Assembly (NA) elections were held under the law, he added.

Addressing the AGP, the CJP said according to him (AGP) the NA elections were held by law.

Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan said the Act 2017 called for elections by secret ballot.

The AGP said Article 59 provided the composition of the Senate. The word act was also used for women in the Senate, he added.

He said direct votes and constituencies had been mentioned for the NA but direct elections were not mentioned for the Senate.

Justice Bandial said the formal procedure for the election of NA members was given in the law but not for the Senate.

The AGP said the procedure for Senate elections was different as members of provincial assemblies proposed the candidates for the Senate. Independent candidates could also participate in the Senate elections, he added.

Justice Ijaz said the members of the provincial assemblies should be allowed to exercise their votes freely.

The attorney general said elections of Senate chairman, deputy chairman, prime minister and the chief ministers were not clear in the Election Commission and the Election Act. Article 60 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the Senate chairman, he added.

Justice Ijaz said Articles 53 and 60 of the Constitution did not mention that there would be open ballot elections or secret elections.

The attorney general said the elections of the NA speaker and Senate chairman would be held through secret balloting under the Article 266.

He said it was clear in the Constitution that the outgoing NA speaker would conduct the election of the speaker. The first task of the elected assembly would be the election of the speaker, he added.

He said the elections of the prime minister, NA speaker and Senate chairman were not conducted under the Election Act.

He said the parliament itself conducted the elections of the prime minister, Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.

He said Article 53 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the speaker but Senate and NA elections were not held under the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz said Article 226 made it clear that all elections, except for the prime minister and the chief ministers, would be held by the secret ballot.

The AGP said the chapter on elections held under the law was different.

The Article 226 did not apply to every election, he added.

The chief justice said if Article 226 applied, the elections for reserved seats could not take place.

He said elections for the national and provincial assemblies were held under the law.

The attorney general said all laws were framed in accordance with the Constitution.

He said political parties submit lists for representation on reserved seats.

He said an independent candidate could contest the Senate election if he was nominated and proposed by a member of the provincial assembly.

Justice Ijaz said if any member of the provincial assembly wanted to vote against the party, he should use open balloting.

The attorney general said generally people considered election only on voting day but the election machinery was also part of the voting process. Elections were not just about voting as it had many stages, he added.

He said constituency elections, preparation of voter lists, delimitation, nomination papers, voting schedule, voting and results were all the stages.

The chief justice said those were the stages of direct elections.

The attorney general said whether there was an assembly or not, the president could issue an ordinance related to the elections.

He said the Senate Election Act of 1975 also laid down the procedure for holding Senate elections.

He said elections under the law could not be challenged but only elections held under the statute could be challenged in tribunals.

Justice Ijaz said elections under the law could be challenged under the Constitution.

The attorney general said the vote of an ordinary citizen was free but the vote of a member of provincial assembly (MPA) given to a senator was not free.

When the MPA’s vote for the Senate could not be free, then the ballot could not be secret, he added.

Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan said it was unwise to vote for another senator by secret ballot in violation of party discipline.

The MPA violating party discipline should have moral courage to openly say that he had voted against the party discipline, he added.

Upon this, Justice Bandial said this was moral, not legal. The MPA had the right to vote according to his will, he added.

The chief justice said the courts were the guardians of the Constitution.

Justice Yahya Afridi addressing the AGP said his argument was moral in nature and the matter was political.

He said the question raised in the presidential reference was legal and ethical but the matter was political.

He asked the attorney general that his case was based on ethics while the issue was political.

He asked why the government was seeking the opinion of the court instead of approaching the parliament?

The attorney general said the government had only approached the SC for an opinion.

If the opinion of the SC was in government’s favour, the final decision was to be taken by the parliament, he added.

He said the SC had given its opinion on the NA’s resolution regarding recognizing Bangladesh.

Justice Afridi said the AGP’s argument regarding Bangladesh was correct.

The attorney general said he could give eleven examples of cases in which the court ruled despite the presence of political aspects.

He said the apex court disqualified politicians by interpreting the law in dual citizenship cases.

He said the issue of disclosure of assets of parliamentarians was political but the SC also interpreted the law on it.

The government had come to the SC to stop the sale and purchase of votes and for transparency, he added.

Justice Ijaz asked the AGP whether he was just asking the court to interpret the Article 226 only?

The attorney general responded that he could not put it more simply.",Q1

https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/12/07/isra-d07.html,Israel’s Netanyahu weakened by US shift on Iran/Syria,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has come under sustained attack for opposing President Barack Obama’s deal with Iran. He and his officials had called it “appeasement,” an “historic mistake,” a “sell-out,” “tantamount to the plague and cholera” and “a danger to Israel’s very existence.”

Former senior Israeli national security officials have called Netanyahu’s attitude potentially damaging to Israel’s strategic ties to Washington, as have neoconservatives and other supporters of Israel in the United States.

Isaac Herzog, the newly elected leader of the opposition Labour Party, said, “The deal that was struck between the world powers and Iran is a fact, and Israel must adjust itself to the new situation.” He called on Netanyahu to “fix the damage that was caused from the public clash with the US and return to an intimate relationship with President Obama and other world leaders.”

An Israeli state official said of Washington, “They are starting to get offended. The personal things said by anonymous sources in Israel about [US Secretary of State John] Kerry were exaggerated and should not have been said.”

British Foreign Secretary William Hague commented, “We would discourage anybody in the world, including Israel, from taking any steps that would undermine this agreement and we will make that very clear to all concerned.”

His was a clear warning to Israel to refrain from any provocations against Iran or its allies that might derail the rapprochement with Tehran.

Kerry, visiting Israel, made it clear that Netanyahu had got the message, saying that in three meetings the prime minister had “been extremely constructive… He understands that we are now in the real negotiations… Israel and the United States are absolutely in synch.”

The agreement with Tehran—the first in more than 30 years—is a major blow for Netanyahu and his co-thinkers in the US, who for years had sought to push the White House into mounting military strikes, or supporting Israel’s attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

No sooner had the ink dried on the Geneva agreement than international diplomats from the Gulf, Turkey and Britain were booking their flights to Tehran. The energy corporations were dusting off their plans for investment and the US was said to be in talks with Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia closely allied with Iran. Israel’s business leaders clearly felt that the deal opened up opportunities, with the Tel Aviv stock exchange hitting a new high.

Washington’s abandonment of its long anticipated air strike against Syria, Iran’s chief Arab ally in the region, and the Geneva agreement with Iran do not represent a turn away from militarism. Rather, they express US imperialism’s drive to utilise its military strength to more effectively dominate the world’s most important oil and gas-exporting region.

While Obama tried to signal a more conciliatory approach to US foreign policy in the Middle East in his Cairo speech in 2009, he continued the military policies of the previous Bush administration, most recently using NATO to back Islamist forces to topple the Gaddafi regime in Libya in 2011. He gave every indication of doing the same in Syria.

But the widespread public opposition at home and in allied states such as the UK finally convinced the White House of the necessity of changing tack. The Obama administration calculated that it could pressure Tehran into granting its energy corporations privileged access to Iran’s oil and natural gas, aiding in suppressing opposition to US foreign policy throughout the region from Afghanistan to Lebanon.

This would underpin the broader strategy of its “pivot to Asia,” since by shoring up the region against its rivals Russia and above all China, the US would better able to encircle and confront China and ensure its hegemony across the Eurasian landmass.

In making this turn, the US could rely on the urgent desire of the Iranian bourgeoisie to reach an accommodation. Tehran faces crippling US sanctions and, no less than its Arab counterparts, growing hostility from its youthful population. More than half of Iran’s 75 million people are under 30, including many either unemployed or underemployed and an impoverished working class.

Iran’s theocratic–led nationalist regime, despite its rhetoric about leading a “Resistance Front”, never wanted conflict with the US. It had made several efforts to reach an accommodation with the US. To this end, it worked with the US in ousting the Taliban in Afghanistan and reining in Muqtada al-Sadr’s Shi’ite forces in Iraq to stabilise the US-puppet Maliki government.

It is the fear that Tehran could become a crucial US ally whose usefulness would outweigh its own that lies behind Netanyahu’s rage over the Geneva deal. The US had long used Israel to control the region through its suppression of Palestinians and military assaults on its neighbours. Israel’s 2006 war on Lebanon was conceived by the Bush administration as the means of destroying Hezbollah militarily and politically and installing a more pliant pro-US government, and it had even called on Israel to attack Syria as part of a broader plan of taking on Iran.

To the extent that the 8-million-strong Israel is today a strong regional player, this is a product both of US aid and the economic, technical, political and military weakness of the other Middle East states.

Tel Aviv, the region’s sole nuclear power, has since the early 1990s used unsubstantiated claims that Iran’s nuclear energy programme serves as a front for the development of nuclear weapons, as a means of furthering its opposition to Tehran.

The Shi’ite regime had sponsored Hezbollah in Lebanon that since the early 1980s had been Israel’s chief opponent in Lebanon, forcing it out of Lebanon in May 2000. But this was no barrier to Israel’s providing support to Iran during the eight-year-long Iraq-Iran war to help defeat Baghdad, which had long sponsored Palestinian groups opposed to Israel.

It was only after the US-led Gulf War in 1991 decisively defeated Iraq and shifted the regional balance of power in Iran’s favour that Israel began its sustained propaganda campaign against Tehran in earnest. It asserted that Iran was just months away from developing a nuclear bomb and was the centre of world terrorism.

Israel’s threats grew in the aftermath of the defeat of the second Palestinian intifada and the virtual imprisonment of former Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in his Ramallah compound. Indeed, Iran and the “Shi’a arc of extremism” came to replace the Palestinians as the most cited “existential threat” to Israel.

In 2004, as Washington became increasingly preoccupied with Iraq and unwilling to engage in another theatre of war, Israel began to issue ultimatums and threats of unilateral strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites.

Like Saudi Arabia, Israel had lobbied intensively for a US assault on Syria in a bid to support the Islamist forces being sponsored by the CIA, Riyadh, Doha and Ankara, to overthrow the Assad regime and bring about regime change in Iran. It was furious at Washington’s turn to diplomacy, having worked closely with the Syrian opposition forces, providing vital intelligence information and training and launching air strikes targeting weapons shipments to the Syrian regime and Hezbollah.

But there has always been a significant layer within the top ranks of the Israeli military, intelligence, political and financial establishment opposed to a military strike against Iran. Former Mossad Director Meir Dagan and former Shin Bet Director Yuval Diskin blocked an Israeli offensive, fearing that war with Iran would leave Tel Aviv imperilled in the Middle East and politically isolated on the international arena. In 2011, Dagan said that a military strike was “the stupidest thing I have ever heard” and “patently illegal under international law.”",Q1

""Afghan and coalition forces returned fire and required defensive air support to suppress the enemy fire.""ISAF added that one of its soldiers was killed in the fighting, as well as at least 10 insurgents.In a statement released later, ISAF said it ""regrets"" that civilians were killed in the operation.The statement added that the mission, led by commandos of the 6th Special Operations Kandak and supported by ISAF special operations advisers, was conducted to disrupt activities by insurgents linked to the Haqqani network in the district, including attacks on Bagram Airfield, and in support of Afghan National Security Forces' tactical priorities.A Taliban spokesperson said that 12 Afghan soldiers had been killed, but the insurgents often exaggerate death tolls.Siahgird district, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Kabul, is on the main road from the capital to Bamiyan.The route was considered safe, but the region has become increasingly violent with major clashes between Afghan security forces and the Taliban erupting since October.Late last year, Karzai made a surprise decision not to promptly sign the bilateral security agreement (BSA) with the United States, leading to the threat of a complete withdrawal of NATO troops by the end of 2014.The BSA would see several thousand US troops remain in Afghanistan to provide training and assistance in the battle against the Taliban after the NATO combat mission ends in December.Signing the agreement is also a precondition for the delivery of billions of dollars in Western aid for Afghanistan, which will hold an election to choose Karzai's successor in April.Afghanistan's army and police have developed rapidly in the past four years, but the country risks slipping into turmoil without foreign assistance if Islamist militias and warlords vie for power.Relations between the United States and Afghanistan also worsened when Kabul last week said it would release scores of alleged Taliban fighters from jail as there was no evidence against them.US President Barack Obama on Monday insisted he had faith in his Afghan war strategy after former defense secretary Robert Gates claimed the president had soured on his 2009 decision to send in 30,000 extra troops.",Q1

Iran Press TV

Tue Feb 11, 2014 10:59AM GMT

Afghanistan says it will release 65 inmates from the controversial Bagram air base prison despite US pressure against the move.

Afghanistan's attorney general issued a final decree on Monday to free the group of prisoners, some of whom were jailed by US forces, from Bagram Prison, which is located north of the capital, Kabul.

Basir Azizi, a spokesman for the attorney general, said, ""The tasked panel of Attorney General Office has addressed the prisoners' cases, resulted in issuing the order for releasing 65 prisoners from Bagram Prison.""

The panel would keep on reviewing the cases of 23 other prisoners, he added.

The exact date of the release has not been announced yet.

The decision comes despite a warning by Washington about the planned release of 88 detainees at the Bagram prison.

The United States claims that some of the prisoners are dangerous criminals and pose a serious security threat.

However, Afghanistan says it has not found sufficient evidence to keep the inmates in prison.

The release comes as the US and Afghanistan are still at loggerheads over a bilateral security deal.

Washington and Kabul signed the deal, under which the US gave control of Bagram to Afghan forces.

In November 2012, Afghan President Hamid Karzai ordered the country's forces to take control of the prison and accused US officials of failing to fully comply with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding on Detentions signed between Kabul and Washington.

Human rights groups say the Bagram detainees were abused and kept in solitary confinement in windowless cells.

http://guardianlv.com/2014/02/taliban-offers-deal-to-release-american-pow/,Taliban Offers Deal to Release American POW,"The Obama administration has renewed talks with the Taliban to make a deal to release an American Prisoner of War being held in Pakistan in exchange for five Taliban members held in Guantanamo Bay. The Taliban offered the U.S. the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2009. The Taliban took credit for the capture and initially offered a deal for Bergdahl in exchange for $21 million along with 21 Afghan prisoners, but the group eventually broke off the negotiations.

Officials from the Obama administration, the Pentagon, and the State Department have reportedly decided to accept the exchange, although no official agreement has been made. The talks continued last month after officials at the Pentagon received video of Bergdahl, who is now 27-years-old, looking in poorer health than he had in previous videos sent from the Taliban. It was the first evidence that Bergdahl was alive in nearly three years. The administration intends to free Bergdahl before the bulk of the armed forces leaves Afghanistan in the next year.

Bergdahl, an Army infantryman, was taken captive after wandering off base in the Paktika Province in Afghanistan. The Taliban claim they captured him after he drunkenly stumbled out of his garrison. Rolling Stone ran an article in 2012 that featured Bergdahl and certain aspects of his story raised the question of whether he was captured or abandoned his post.

“If this deployment is lame, I’m just going to walk off into the mountains of Pakistan,” Bergdahl told former Specialist Jason Fry.

In the last email Bergdahl sent to his parents before being captured, he wrote that life is too short to spend helping fools with their ideas that are wrong and that he was ashamed to be an American.

The article called into question his loyalty to the U.S. but officials are focused on bringing him home safely. The Pentagon’s press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said that Bergdahl has been gone too long and the government has not stopped trying to get him home.

Last year, the Taliban offered a deal to the U.S. in which they would release Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban prisoners imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, but President Obama refused based on the U.S.’s longstanding policy of not negotiating with terrorists.

Since there is no concrete evidence of Bergdahl’s location, there is no plan for a rescue mission. But officials believe Bergdahl is being held in Pakistan by the Haqqani network.

The Pentagon has considered negotiating the terms of Bergdahl’s release directly with the Haqqani network, which falls under the Taliban insurgency but operates separately. The U.S. holds a number of Haqqani prisoners in Afghanistan.

The renewed talks come amid an issue the administration has with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has refused to sign a security pact with the U.S. that would allow some military forces to remain in Afghanistan. Without the agreement, the U.S. will have no presence in Afghanistan, which will reduce its leverage with the Taliban.

Despite the Taliban’s offer to the U.S. to release a POW, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, James Dobbins, has publicly stated that he doubts the Taliban are ready to make the deal.

Now, 12 years later, will they stay to battle the Taliban?

During his speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, President Obama said the core of al Qaeda – the terror group that U.S. and NATO troops have been battling for more than a decade – has been dismantled. Afghan Foreign Minister Zalmai Rassoul said he agrees with that assessment, but his country still needs help battling the Taliban.

“[The] Taliban is not powerful enough in Afghanistan, but they continue to disturb our security,” Rassoui told CNN’s Situation Room on Thursday. “One thing that we're focusing on now is the peace process to convince those in Taliban to come to the peace process, join Afghanistan and stop fighting.”

On Monday, a Taliban ambush on a border post in southern Afghanistan killed 11 police officers. And earlier this month, Taliban militants used car bombs to attack a U.S. consulate in western Afghanistan, killing two Afghans and wounding 17 other Afghans.

The remaining 60,000 U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan are scheduled to leave by the end of 2014, but both sides are still trying to hammer out a deal to keep a small number behind to continue to train and advise the Afghan army and police. At issue is whether those troops would be immune from prosecution under Afghan law while they remain in the country – the same issue that derailed an agreement to leave U.S. troops behind in Iraq.

“The transition of the security has been fairly finished. The third phase has started. We need not a sudden disruption of the security. By the time our security forces are fighting and replacing the NATO forces, we need their training and equipping the Afghan security force,” Rassoui said. “We're in discussions with United States on a security agreement to which a number, a limited number of United States forces and also other NATO forces would stay in Afghanistan.”

Rassoui said he believes that about 10,000 U.S. and NATO troops would stay past 2014, about the same number that top U.S. generals have been floating. But the two sides have yet to be able to sign a Bilateral Security Agreement that sets out immunity and other conditions. U.S. officials ideally would like that agreement in place before next spring’s presidential elections to replace Hamid Karzai. Rassoui is a top candidate to run for the nation’s highest office, but he said he hasn’t yet decided.

Still, as negotiations continue, Rassoui said Afghan-U.S. relations are “solid.”",Q1

The country was writhing under martial law. Not a single newspaper editor had dared to write the truth about why General Zia ul Haq had used “preventive detention” laws to jail me. In fact they had all readily clutched at the officially sponsored lies about my case. One day, I silently raged, I would have my own paper and it would stand up to tyranny and expose the lies and fear that stalk our everyday lives.

General Zia ul Haq didn’t like me. I had published “From Jinnah to Zia” by Justice (retd) Mohammad Munir after every major publisher in the country had turned it down because it was overly critical of the dictator. After the author’s death a couple of years later, a khaki emissary advised me to quietly withdraw the book from sale. “You can ban it”, I had demurred. Then I published a book on US-Pak Relations whose cover was taken from a painting by the famous artist Mian Ijaz ul Hasan. It showed the US Aid emblem in which there are two clasped hands in friendship, except that Mian Ijaz had rendered one of the hands as a skeleton and squeezed a drop of blood out of it. The then US Ambassador to Pakistan protested to General Zia and the dye was cast. When Henry Kissinger complained about his book being pirated by a bookseller in Karachi, they went instead for me in Lahore and bunged me in as a “terrorist”. Amnesty International and BBC investigated the case and rubbished the authorities. But not a single Pakistani newspaper was prepared to expose the lie. In the event, no charges were formally pressed and I was released a month later. But by then an idea had begun to germinate whose time would come one day.

There is a passage in Emma Duncan’s wonderful book on Pakistan written in 1987 (Breaking the Curfew) that describes the path Jugnu Mohsin, my wife and TFT’s publisher, had to take during 1985-1988 for permission to publish TFT.

In order to start a magazine, an applicant has to have his form cleared and stamped by, in turn, the city magistrate, the local police, the city magistrate, the provincial press information department, the chief minister’s office, the provincial press information department, the federal press information department, the intelligence bureau, the federal press information department, the provincial press information department, the deputy commissioner and, once again, for luck, the provincial press information department.

In order to start a magazine, an applicant has to have his form cleared and stamped by, in turn, the city magistrate, the local police, the city magistrate

Several decisions were critical and some moments were noteworthy. Jugnu had to be the listed as the “publisher” because I was too notorious an offender for comfort. Then we waited to apply pending the arrival of a City Magistrate who might be more sympathetic than curious. As luck would have it, Mr Sher Afghan, with antecedents in Okara from where Jugnu’s family hails, arrived on the scene in 1985 and helped push the application along. Then a friendly Director General Public Relations Punjab nudged the file to chief minister Nawaz Sharif’s office where it lay in cold storage for months until Jugnu’s cousin-in-law Javed Bokhari was appointed principal secretary to the CM and put up the file to Nawaz Sharif.

When Jugnu was called for an interview with Mr Sharif, she was pregnant with Mira and looking sufficiently benign. Nawaz was pleased to note that she was the niece of Syed Sajjad Haider, a stalwart of the Muslim League from Okara. But he was more than a little curious when she confirmed for him that she was Syeda Abida Hussain’s cousin. “Ah”, said Nawaz, his eyes narrowing, “is this going to be a political paper?”. “Of course not”, Jugnu smiled back, feigning innocence, “it’s going to be a social chit chat thing, you know, with lots of pictures of parties and weddings”.

“Good”, advised Nawaz, adding “I hope you won’t get me into trouble”. And with a flourish he signed the paper.

A month later, there was a knock on my office door and in walked a thick set, rather ominous looking Police Inspector with a file under his arm.

“Najam Aziz Sethi, s/o Abdul Aziz Sethi?”, he inquired in an officious manner. “Yes”, I mumbled.

“I’m from the IB”, he explained in Urdu, “Have you applied for permission to start a weekly paper?”

“No”, I said quickly, my heart skipping a beat. “But my wife wants to take out a social chit-chat thingie”, I volunteered eagerly.

His eyes twinkled. He smiled wryly and leaned over the table.

“Same difference, Sethi Sahib.”

Silence. I rubbed my hands under the table. He smiled, surveyed my office, pulled out a chair and made himself comfortable.

“Would you like some tea?” I asked.

“No sugar, please, I have diabetes”.

“Is there a problem with the permission?”, I asked innocently.

“There could be”, he pursed his lips mysteriously, “if you are involved”.

“But I’m not involved. You see…”.

“Come, come Sethi Sahib, we know all about you. You’re a trouble maker, aren’t you, always upsetting people and going to prison”, he said menacingly. “Your wife is fronting for you, isn’t she? There’s no way you can be cleared.”

“Hmmn”, I nodded glumly, not to affirm that I was a “trouble maker” but to confirm to myself that the game was over.

The tea arrived. He stirred it, helped himself to a handful of biscuits.

“How did my book sell?” he asked.

I was nonplussed and couldn’t place the Urdu book in question. It must have showed on my expression.

“Forgotten about it, haven’t you?” he chuckled. “I’ve seen a lot of unsold copies lying about in your shop”, he noted.

“Hmmn”.

“But if they haven’t sold out, why have you paid the supplier in full?”, he inquired. Then he proceeded to pull a book out of his file and placed it on the table in front of me.

“Oh, this, yes, yes, some fellow came to see me some months ago and said he was hard up and wanted me to sell this book. It didn’t sell at all but I gave him the cash anyway because he seemed genuinely in difficulty”, I explained.

“Do you remember who that fellow was?”, he grinned mysteriously.

Oh no, I thought, maybe there’s some subversive material in this book and they’re going to pin it on me.

“No, I don’t remember”, I said flatly.

“I see”, he said softly. Silence. A long silence. He slurped his tea with evident pleasure.

“This book, Sethi Sahib, is written by my deceased father”, he finally explained, “I was in civvies when I brought it to your shop three months ago after every bookseller in Lahore had refused to stock it, let alone sell it. I didn’t tell you I worked for the IB. But you not only took it, you gave me full payment in cash last month even though many copies remain unsold”.

“Really?”, I said dumbly, with vague recollections of someone imploring me to buy the book because he needed the money desperately.

“Really!”, he exclaimed emphatically. “You may be a trouble maker for some but for me you’re an angel”.

Relief. Smiles all round. More slurping of tea. He got up, shook my hand, and turned on his heel. At the door, he turned around, bowed, and said: “Good luck with your paper, sir, the IB is going to say that Jugnu Mohsin Sahiba’s father is in the clear and we shall omit to note whether she is married or not”.

Permission to publish TFT arrived in the post to Jugnu in 1987, three years after the application was submitted in 1985.

But General Zia was still around. And there was no sign of any press freedom. In fact, only months earlier, Aziz Siddiqui, the gentle editor of the Frontier Post in Peshawar, had been relieved under ISI pressure because he had published a small item about how Mrs Zia ul Haq had drawn on the public exchequer for medical treatment abroad. So we determined to lie low.

But that was easier said than done. Under the law, we were obliged to publish the paper within three months, failing which the permission would lapse. So Jugnu did the unprecedented thing of writing for permission to the DC to delay the publication of TFT for one year because of circumstances beyond her control. She explained that she had just had a baby and was too busy being a mother to be an editor or publisher. The usual “family” strings were pulled and permission was duly granted. We were in the throes of asking for another year’s extension when General Zia ul Haq perished in an air crash.

That night Jugnu and I sat up until the early hours of the morning planning the new paper. In the following weeks, we marshaled our meager resources and by December were ensconced in a small office on Turner Road, just behind the Lahore High Court. I went around Lahore and Karachi to the offices of the Big Wigs in the media asking for advice. One media baron bluntly said “If you’re got money to throw away, give it to charity”; another advised “It’s more difficult than a daily, that’s why we’ve not ventured into an English weekly”. But five months later, in May 1989, Jugnu and I launched TFT without a thought of how it would survive in the big bad world out there.",Q1

The Government will shortly flesh out its strategic vision for the future of the UK arms industry when further details of its much-vaunted Defence Growth Partnership (DGP) are unveiled.



Timed to coincide with DSEI, an annual defence and security trade show in London, ministers from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Ministry of Defence will explain how they intend to boost exports, create jobs and sustain the crucial supply chain, which includes many small to medium-sized companies.



Our defence manufacturing sector is clearly important. It contributes £22billion to the economy, with some £5.4billion coming from export markets, and directly employs 107,000 people.



Investment is vital for the survival of the arms industry

When launched in December 2012, the stated aims of the DGP included looking at how the links between civil and military technologies can be better exploited as well as what skills the sector needs in future and whether these could be transferred between defence and other manufacturing industries.



Relations between defence firms and the Government have been strained by a raft of over-budget and late projects, some of which were cancelled.



But one struggles to exist without the other. The only alternative is to buy equipment off the shelf from foreign nations. Yet behind the scenes industry insiders have suggested the DGP has met stiff resistance at the Ministry of Defence.



One said the MoD has been doing its best to kill off the initiative, adding that defence mandarins detest the DGP because it is a nuisance at a time when they are coping with drastically reduced budgets and the drawdown of activity in Afghanistan.



To date there has been only the announcement establishing the group and the appointment of Steve Wadey, of missile systems firm MBDA, as the industry’s chairman to work alongside business minister Michael Fallon.

But more importantly, the DGP has yet to have any money allocated to it.

In contrast, the Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP) – launched two-and-a-half years ago and declared a resounding success – has seen more than £1billion of investment committed by the Government over a seven-year period.



Why the disparity? For one, the wider aerospace industry is much bigger than its defence sibling. But civil aerospace companies are also eager to invest in new products and technology amid huge growth forecasts for the sector.



Defence firms are more reluctant largely because global defence cuts mean there is not necessarily an end customer for their products.



Whitehall currently spends just 2 per cent of the annual defence budget of around £25billion on research and development.



Any hopes that the DGP can emulate its aerospace forerunner can only be fulfilled if there is a commitment of serious cash. One industry source suggested a mere £150million from government, to be matched by industry, would be the opening salvo for the DGP.



MoD, naturally, denies there is any rift over the DGP. Procurement minister Philip Dunne has, after all, made several supportive-sounding speeches on the subject.

And there can be no denying the policy is rebalancing the economy away from the consumer-driven service sector and growing manufacturing and exports.



Overseas sales are increasingly important as UK and US defence budgets are squeezed. BAE Systems, maker of the Typhoon jet fighter and Hawk training aircraft, is just one example of a defence business that is adept at punting its wares to foreign powers having sold everything from aircraft to ships and tanks in the past.



By 2016 international sales will account for half the revenues at BAE’s military aviation business. This can only happen through strong connections with foreign governments.



Overseas customers, who are also looking for inward investment into their economies, want a clear demonstration of faith in a military asset like an aircraft, tank or ship by the home government.



In other words, they want to buy proven technology that is being used by UK armed forces and our allies. There can be no better shop window for any piece of UK-made military hardware than its selection for service with HM Armed Forces.

http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/03/analysis-trimming-us-military-might-20143683828811494.html,Analysis: Trimming US military might,"With tensions running high between the US and Russia over the latter’s military intervention in Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has advised his Russian counterparts to be cautious.

“Let’s keep the tensions down, let’s see no provocative actions by anyone. This is a time for very cool, wise leadership,” Hagel said.

But a very different, more combative US defence secretary took the podium a week earlier at the Pentagon. That time, his words weren’t directed at a foreign power, but at his own government. On February 25, Chuck Hagel unveiled the Pentagon’s budgetary plans for 2015, wading into an ongoing struggle with the US Congress over curbing defence spending by drastically cutting the size of the military.

“On March 1, 2013 – one year ago this week – steep and abrupt automatic spending cuts were imposed on the department of defence and other agencies across the government under the mechanism of sequestration,” said Hagel. “The reality of reduced resources requires some difficult choices.”

The past decade has seen gigantic Pentagon budgets: In 2011, US defence spending reached $711bn, an amount several times bigger than the comparable figure for China, the world’s second-biggest military spender. A majority of US military spending went towards maintaining large troop presences in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Hagel laid out a meticulous plan to cut troop numbers from 450,000 to 420,000 by 2016, bringing overall troop numbers down to levels last seen before World War II.

“I think Secretary Hagel is trying to make the best of a very difficult situation,” said former Defense Secretary William Cohen to Al Jazeera, referring to the automatic spending cuts, known as “sequestration”, imposed on the US budget after legislators failed to agree on deficit reduction measures by the end of 2012. “This has a devastating impact across the board, without any regard to the overall military strategy.”

Pricey weapons



Hagel’s announcement came following years of haggling over the size of the US military. Since 9/11, US military strategists have preferred to operate a cheaper fleet of drones to hunt for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, instead of bulkier, more expensive options.

The Joint Strike Fighter, better known as the F-35, is one such expensive weapon. The programme has been 11 years in the making and has already cost American taxpayers close to $400bn, running 70 percent over budget.

The Pentagon has plans to induct more than 2,400 F-35 fighter jets into the military, but has earmarked funds for only 35 of the controversial planes in next year’s budget. “Almost every hardware programme the Pentagon buys costs twice as much and takes twice as long to deliver – and it gives you about half the performance you thought you were going to get in the beginning,” said Gordon Adams, a defence budget analyst at the Stimson Center.

Official figures reveal that in 2008, when American troop numbers peaked in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US had spent more than $100bn to maintain around 187,900 soldiers in both conflicts that year – an average of about $532,000 per soldier deployed. More than two million US soldiers have been deployed in wars since 2001.

In their budget estimates to Congress, Pentagon officials claimed $130,000 as the annual cost of stationing one US soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan. “The cost included combat pay, travel to the battle front and the incremental cost to house and feed one soldier in theatre,” said former Pentagon and Rand Corporation defence analyst Stuart E Johnson. In measuring the cost of war, Johnson said, “the Pentagon repeatedly singled out this figure to base their assumptions on war financing”.

Ambitious estimates



In trying to quantify costs, Pentagon officials insisted on a “number value” that at least gave the illusion of accountability. “When it comes to funding wars, illusions matter,” said Malou Innocent, a foreign policy analyst with the Cato Institute. “As the war goals were recklessly ambitious, so too was spending. The real cost of war will start to emerge once the wars end.”

“The numbers are an illusion,” said David Gold, a professor at the New School and co-founder of the Study Group on the Economics of Security. “The department of defence reached conflicting estimates by a complex process of divisions to keep the estimates low.”

But why would officials want to underestimate total costs? Wouldn’t the urge be to exaggerate demands to get more funding?

Gold explains that by systematically underestimating costs, administrations have been more easily able to win Congressional approval for defence spending. “Because of the politics of budgets, it’s easier to get funding through the US Congress if budgets are lower.”

Furthermore, estimates of the cost of war seldom account for the investments made to buy peace. US aid money to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan – the three major foreign aid recipients since 9/11 – run in the tens of billions of dollars, but are not included in war funding estimates. Instead, they are included in other pieces of legislation or are hidden in discretionary spending clauses and amendments.

What’s the ‘real cost’?



A 2013 report by Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic Studies put the cost of funding the war in Afghanistan at $443.12bn up to 2011. But $198bn was released in 2012 alone. “It is a clear case of too much, too late,” said the report. “The surge in aid spending creates the irony that the maximum actual cash flow disbursements is only occurring now that transition is in place and major cuts are coming between 2012 and 2014.”

The Pentagon has already appropriated $1tn from US taxpayers to fund a decade of wars. But Columbia professor and Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz has controversially argued that the true figure is “much more like $5tn”.

The actual number, said Gold, remains elusive because of the flawed way in which military funding is appropriated and spent. “The real cost can never be truly determined.”",Q1

The leader of the Pakistani Taliban is reported to have been killed by a U.S. drone strike. Hakimullah Mehsud's group is believed responsible for attacks across Pakistan. He is also implicated in the attack that killed seven CIA employees at a CIA base in Afghanistan in late 2009. Mehsud has been reported to have been killed before, but sources are confident this time.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

The leader of the Pakistan's Taliban is reported to have been killed by a U.S. drone strike. Hakimullah Mehsud has been a target before and past reports of his death have proved false. If he is dead - and a large number of reports suggest that he is - it would be an important development because Mehsud had a critical role inside Pakistan. NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman has been reporting on this story and joins us now. And, Tom, first, what more can you tell us about Hakimullah Mehsud?

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Well, Robert, as you said, he's the leader of Pakistani Taliban, and that group is basically focused on attacks inside Pakistan. And his organization has been targeted by the U.S. drone campaign. U.S. is actually working in tandem with Pakistani intelligence officials on going after this particular group.

SIEGEL: But there have been reports in the past that he had been killed, obviously reports that didn't bear out. Why do officials seem so confident that this attack did get him?

BOWMAN: Well, they're saying it was a drone strike in North Waziristan, in the Miran Shah area, and that's in the Pakistani tribal area just across the border from Afghanistan. And we understand from reports both in the United States and in Pakistan that there were multiple strikes from drones. Intelligence sources told NPR in Pakistan that Mehsud had come to attend a meeting at a mosque. And as soon as he reached his home, he was hit by the drone strike. And we're told his uncle was killed as well.

Now, the reason they're confident is that his own Taliban organization said in a statement that he'd be buried tomorrow. Usually, if something like this didn't happen, the Taliban would say, well, he's alive and well and there were no truth to the reports that he'd been killed. And besides this, there were numerous reports out of Pakistan's media and officials in Pakistan that he had indeed been killed in the drone strike.

SIEGEL: And there was a $5 million bounty on Mehsud's head. Why was he such a high priority for the U.S.?

BOWMAN: Well, as I said, many of the attacks his group launched took place in Pakistan. And in those attacks, many civilians and Pakistani security officials were killed. But there was one attack in particular that took place in Afghanistan, just across the border. This is 2009 and seven CIA officials and security personnel were killed in a brazen suicide attack at a CIA outpost in Khost, again, just across the border.

And those who've seen the movie ""Zero Dark Thirty"" may remember this scene. It's a gripping scene in which CIA personnel are talking to a person that came in. They were going to interrogate him. And they didn't check him sufficiently enough and he was wearing a bomb, detonated himself and killed some CIA officials.

SIEGEL: And Mehsud is linked to that plot.

BOWMAN: Exactly. Mehsud was linked to that plot, so, obviously, he was very high on the CIA's list.

SIEGEL: Now, as you said, this was apparently a drone strike that targeted Mehsud. And I assume we'll be hearing that this shows the effectiveness of drone strikes. But it's a very controversial policy, the use of U.S. drones

BOWMAN: Absolutely. Just this week, two human rights groups, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, came out with a report citing civilian deaths from drones, hundreds if not thousands killed in this U.S. campaign. And just this week, several family members of drone victims were on Capitol Hill as well. Of course, President Obama has promised to limit drone strikes. But I think, clearly, if they have someone in their sights like this, like Hakimullah Mehsud, they're going to continue to use those drone strikes.

SIEGEL: That's NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, thank you.

BOWMAN: You're welcome, Robert.

http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-198033-A-moment-of-truth,Indian general credits ISPR on doing excellent work for Pakistan,"LONDON: Retired senior Indian military commander Lt General (R) Syed Ata Hasnain has praised Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) for doing a phenomenal job in disseminating information, connecting with the masses and setting the correct narrative beyond just Pakistani sphere.

The former General Officer Commanding 15 Corps (HQs Srinagar), Indian Army, was speaking at a seminar organised by International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) on the subject of “Civil Society in Jammu & Kashmir: democracy vs terrorism”. Rahul Roy-Chaudhry, Senior Fellow for South Asia IISS chaired the seminar and other speakers included Dr Shabir Chaudhry, President Foreign Affairs Committee of United Kashmir People's National Party (UKPNP) and Nitin A. Gokhale, Chief Executive Officer and Editor-in-Chief, Bharat Shakti, India.

One of India’s most decorated military officers, General Ata spoke about the ISPR in his opening remarks and then returned to discuss it various times during the question and answer session. He retired in June 2013 as the Military Secretary, after 40 years of service in the Indian armed forces. In occupied Jammu and Kashmir he served as the GOC 15 Corps, with Headquarters in Srinagar, from 2010 to 2012.

“I give full marks to Pakistan for the manner in which it has played out the information strategy. The ISPR has done an outstanding work for Pakistan,” he said in his speech claiming that India started losing narrative in Held Kashmir in 90s and has not been able to wrest control.

He said that in India “everyone knows what the ISI but nobody what the ISPR is” and only military professionals know about the ISPR.

General Ata Hasnain said that the aspect of hybrid warfare has not been understood in India and authorities in India have failed to grasp that “the hybrid can only be countered by hybrid and not by conventional means”. He gave examples of Iraq and Afghanistan where the Americans have spent billions of dollars but failed to achieve the desired results. “Hybrid in Iraq and Afghanistan should have been fought by hybrid but hybrid was fought by going conventional”.

He advised India to take a leaf out of Pakistan’s strategy and use information strategy, counter radicalisation to connect with Kashmiris if it was serious to address the causes of alienation. He said that for India-Pakistan relations Pervez Musharaff’s period of 2004-2008 was the best as it looked like that borders will become irrelevant and the issues will be resolved but then it became apparent that Musharraf’s formula didn’t have acceptance within the Pakistan army. General Ata said India has made many mistakes in its military approach but one the biggest ones has been about “the Military-Civic Action (MCA)”. He added: “The MCA is not soft power. It’s not psychological. In 30 years Indian has made many mistakes as far its strategy is concerned but one of the major mistakes is to think that the MCA is a psychological operation, it’s information operation. It’s not.

“If anyone has taught us how to play information operation it’s the ISPR of Pakistan who have done it marvellously, I would like to give it back to them, always. Credit to them.”

He claimed that India and Pakistan have been engaged in hybrid war in Kashmir where sometime India had upper hand and sometime Pakistan but “from 2012 onwards Pakistan got upper hand and the change of the generation and social media made all the difference. We didn’t know how to carry the information side of things but Pakistan has done it extremely well”.

He said that India has been thwarted in Kashmir by the rise of social media from 2010 onwards. He said the new generation of Kashmir used social media to promote “Azaadi” narrative and that has gone against India. He said that the character of Kashmir has changed locally from once being home to Sufiism and shrines to the radicalisation of these mosques and tremendous amount of passion at funeral of Kashmiris killed by Indian forces and religious affiliation.

He defended the use of hard power in Kashmir but agreed that it has not worked but said that in the end India will come to give up the muscular power and come to the soft power.

Nitin Gokhale defended use of power by India against Kashmiris. He said that India tried all other options but failed and then decided to use the harshest methods including choking finances of the pro-independence leadership. He justified that India was right to use all kinds of methods.

Rahul Roy-Chaudhry told this scribe: “In view of the Pulwama suicide bombing attack that led to India and Pakistan almost coming to the brink of war, this session focused on key issues of governance, radicalisation, separatism, terrorism and the media in Kashmir, amidst looming parliamentary elections. It provided an opportunity to ‘look forward’, not ‘backwards’, towards political and regional stability.”

Dr Shabir Chaudhry condemned illegal detention of Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) leader Yasin Malik and other Kashmiris. He criticised Indian government for banning the JKLF last week. He said that use of hard power by India – such as pellet guns, torture and killings - had played a big part in the alienation of Kashmiris.",Q1

Islamabad: The Pakistani Taliban, today, named Khan Syed Mehsud alias Sajna as its new chief, a day after a US drone strike killed its former leader Hakimullah Mehsud in the lawless North Waziristan tribal region.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan’s Shura (Council), media reports said. Most of the members of the council were present in the meeting held at an undisclosed location though all could not attend it.

All 43 members of the Shura attending the meeting voted in favour of Sajna, militants sources were quoted as saying by Dawn News. It said the election was not confirmed by factions of the militant grouping.

Sajna, 36, is believed to have been involved in an attack on a naval base in Karachi and is credited with masterminding a 2012 jailbreak in which the Taliban freed nearly 400 inmates in the northwestern city of Bannu. “Sajna has no basic education, conventional or religious, but he is battle-hardened and has experience of fighting in Afghanistan,” an official had said earlier.

Sajna was heading the South Waziristan Taliban. The council considered four names for the top post, including Sajna, Umar Khalid Khurasani, Mullah Fazlullah and Ghalib Mehsud.

Mohmand Taliban chief Umar Khalid Khurasani was a strong contender as he was the only surviving senior commander who had directly led operations under Hakimullah. Mullah Fazlullah, chief of the Swat Taliban, was another possible choice but he is currently in Afghanistan.

A number of our warriors are returning with multiple injuries%2C many of which are severe.

Jay Briseno Jr.%27s parents are like so many who provide around-the-clock care.

This July 4%2C take the pledge. This is a societal problem that requires a national response.

This is a unique time in our country. We are in the longest war in U.S. history. Advances in battlefield medicine mean that many of our troops are surviving who would have lost their lives in previous wars. But a number of our warriors are returning with multiple injuries and illnesses, many of which are severe.

In June 2003, about three months after his military deployment to Iraq, a bullet fired at point-blank range tore through the neck of Joseph ""Jay"" Briseno Jr. It severed his spinal cord, leaving the 20-year-old blind and paralyzed from the shoulders down.

Jay underwent a series of surgeries and was eventually released into the care of his family. His father, Joseph, converted their living room into an intensive care unit and, over time, taught himself to be Jay's physical therapist, respiratory therapist, wound care nurse, and GI nurse. Every day Joseph and his wife, Eva, watch over their son's breathing, check vital signs, monitor tubes and wires, and oversee over 100 medicines and medical supplies.

In addition to providing around-the-clock care, they serve as case managers and advocates. They must navigate care across multiple health care systems that include the Department of Defense, Veterans Health Administration, and private providers -- no easy task given different structures and eligibility criteria. They also handle their son's legal and financial matters. They represent as many as 1 million people across America caring for military members and veterans injured in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I first began hearing stories like the Briseno's in 2010, when my husband, Bob, was hospitalized. Because he is a WWII veteran, he was treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I became a caregiver, visiting Bob regularly in what became an extended stay of 11 months, and meeting dozens of wounded warriors and their caregivers. I saw a wife sleeping on a makeshift pallet at the side of her husband's bed. I watched a mother tape Bible verses to the walls of her son's hospital room for inspiration and encouragement. I listened to veterans such as Chaz Allen, a double amputee, whose wife, Jessica, cares for him. Caregivers, I learned, face steep challenges as they strive to understand differing eligibility criteria regarding their loved one's qualifications for benefits.

A comprehensive, evidence-based study by the RAND Corporation, which my foundation commissioned last year, confirms the depth of such problems. Preliminary findings released in March show that government programs are still in their infancy and community resources, while well-intentioned, are scattered and uncoordinated. They are not holistic.

RAND explored how military caregiving is unique from other forms of caregiving. Military and veteran caregivers often provide care continuously, day and night. Such care may be labor-intensive, and the caregiver is sometimes the only available, knowledgeable, or trusted person to provide it. For example, a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) only felt safe with his immediate family. When his spouse was unavailable, their children had to assume caregiving duties. Military caregivers, in particular, may be required to provide high levels of emotional support.

According to RAND, approximately 725,000 service members deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan may have experienced PTSD or TBI and over 60,000 have been physically wounded. Behind each of these numbers is a military caregiver whose life changed the moment an insurgent detonated a roadside bomb, pulled the trigger of a gun, or launched a rocket-propelled grenade.

They are people like Joseph and Eva Briseno, hidden heroes who save our country millions in health care costs as they generously and lovingly provide hope and healing to a wounded warrior, often for a lifetime. RAND's research to be completed in early 2014 will provide actionable, measurable recommendations for the public, private, and non-profit sectors leading to a national strategy. This is a societal problem that requires a national response.

On this Independence Day, I'm asking citizens in every corner of the country to adopt America's Pledge to Military and Veteran Caregivers. America's wounded warriors have nobly earned our deepest respect and appreciation -- so too have their caregivers. These hidden heroes toil for years, even decades, in quiet, humble service. They have laid profound and costly sacrifices, to borrow President Lincoln's words, ""upon the alter of freedom.""

http://www.palestinechronicle.com/give-peace-a-chance/,No More Sanctions on Iran: Give Peace a Chance,"By Ron Forthofer

The U.S. has often resorted to military means as a way of settling disputes with far weaker nations during the last fifty years. Frequently these attacks have been unwarranted as well as violations of international law. U.S. attacks on Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Serbia and Iraq (2003) are a few examples of these illegal conflicts.

We are currently fighting in Afghanistan and illegally using drones to kill in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. After long years of fighting and losing wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. public is fed up with senseless conflicts. This point was made clear recently by the huge public outcry against illegally bombing Syria.

Besides the millions it killed and the incredible destruction it wreaked on far weaker nations, the U.S. has incurred costs as well. Tens of thousands of U.S, soldiers were killed and hundreds of thousands more were wounded. The families of these physically and/or mentally/emotionally wounded veterans also continue to pay an enormous and incalculable price. These unnecessary campaigns cost trillions of dollars, money that could have been far better used domestically to improve the real security of our people. The bottom line is that these wars have been counterproductive, increasing the hatred towards the U.S. and decreasing ours and the world’s security.

Thus it is not surprising at all that there was tremendous public relief here at home and worldwide about the interim agreement negotiated in Geneva and signed on November 24th between Iran and the P5+1 nations (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany). This agreement essentially calls for a short-term freeze on some of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programs in exchange for some very limited relief from economic sanctions, including allowing Iran access to a pittance of its own money held in other countries. The goal is a permanent agreement that will greatly reduce the threat to world peace.

Despite widespread relief and praise for the deal, unsurprisingly, there are some hardliners in Iran, the U.S. and Israel who expressed opposition. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was particularly vociferous in his condemnation of the deal, and Israeli officials did not rule out an illegal Israeli attack on Iran during the next six months. Interestingly, Israeli President Peres had a somewhat different reaction. According to a CNN article, Peres said: “This is an interim deal. The success or failure of the deal will be judged by results, not by words.”

Netanyahu and his U.S. Congressional supporters continue to hammer on the disputed idea of an existential threat to Israel of an Iranian nuclear weapon. They somehow manage to ignore assessments by U.S., Israeli and British intelligence agencies that Iran currently does not have a nuclear weapons program. This has been the conclusion of the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate since 2007 and was reiterated in testimony to Congress in 2011 and 2012. The Estimate said that Iran stopped it nuclear weapons program in 2003.

The assessment added that Iran has the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon eventually, making the central issue the political will to do so. Regarding the political will, the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a fatwa saying the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons was forbidden under Islam.

Numerous U.S. and Israeli military and political leaders think that a military attack on Iran would be unsuccessful and would drive Iran to build nuclear weapons to defend itself. The Friends Committee on National Legislation has compiled many quotes on this point and the insanity of an attack.

One quote from the above site by Meir Dagan, former head of Israel’s Mossad, captures the sense of these officials. In a 2011 article he said: “[Attacking Iran is] ‘the stupidest thing I have ever heard…It will be followed by a war with Iran. It is the kind of thing where we know how it starts, but not how it will end.”

If we want to stop another insane, counterproductive, illegal, unwarranted and costly conflict, tell Congress that it must not enact more sanctions on Iran, sanctions that would suggest the U.S. is not negotiating in good faith. Supporting Netanyahu harms U.S. interests.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., March 3 (Reuters) - The rare court-martial of a U.S. Army general charged with sex crimes will delve into explicit details of his adulterous affair with a female captain in two war zones, and alleged inappropriate email exchanges with several other subordinates.

The accusations led to Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair's removal from command in Afghanistan in 2012 and his trial, set to begin on Tuesday at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, will shed light on how the military handles such complaints.

Proponents of military justice reform say the case underscores broader problems with the U.S. armed forces' approach to sexual assault prosecutions and shows the need for an overhaul as such crime reports increase.

A chief concern, reform advocates say, is that the current system gives military commanders without legal training control over prosecutions, prompting accusations of partiality.

""This case is illustrating why the current system can be very counter-productive,"" said Diane Mazur, a former Air Force officer and professor of military and constitutional law at the University of Florida.

Sinclair's attorneys argue that defense officials facing intense political pressure to curb sexual violence in the military have targeted an officer who has served five combat tours with sex charges that hang on weak evidence and an unreliable primary witness.

The lead prosecutor in the case resigned less than a month before trial because military leaders were ordering him to proceed despite his doubts about the main accuser's trustworthiness, according to the defense.

Claims of unlawful command influence and questions about the accuser's credibility have overshadowed the array of disciplinary lapses of which Sinclair stands accused, including seeking nude photos from female soldiers, possessing pornography while deployed and mistreating subordinates.

SEXUAL ASSAULT REPORTS RISE

Preliminary data shows the military received approximately 5,400 reports of sexual assault in fiscal year 2013, a 60 percent increase over the 3,374 victims' reports received in fiscal year 2012, a Defense Department spokeswoman said.

Lieutenant Colonel Cathy Wilkinson said Pentagon officials consider the rise in reports a positive sign that their efforts in the past year to crack down on sexual violence have bolstered victims' confidence in the military's response.

Defense officials oppose a Senate plan that would transfer the power to decide whether to try sexual assault cases to an independent military prosecutor. The military prides itself on being apolitical, and outside scrutiny has not factored into which cases result in charged offenses, Wilkinson said.

""They are pursued because they've been independently investigated and there's been evidence that supports charging these crimes,"" she said.

Whether Sinclair, who is among only a handful of generals to face a court-martial in recent decades, is guilty of sexual assault will be a central question posed to the five other generals who sit as panel members.

Sinclair, 51, a married father of two school-age children, admits to an affair with an unmarried 34-year-old captain. It began when they deployed to Iraq in 2009 and continued for several years through deployments in Germany and Afghanistan and time spent back in the United States.

Text messages, some of them sexually provocative, between the two soldiers reveal their mutual affection. ""You make me happy,"" Sinclair wrote in April 2011.

""You are my heart and world you beautiful magnificent man,"" said the captain, whose name is being withheld by Reuters due to the nature of the charges.

But prosecutors also said the general threatened to harm her career and family if she exposed their relationship, and twice forced her to perform oral sex. The latter allegation is the basis for another charge, forcible sodomy, that could send Sinclair to prison for life, if he is convicted.

The Part Time Praetorian

by James Dunnigan

December 9, 2013 The Italian manufacturer of the 28 ton C-27J transport is building a gunship version called the MC-27J Praetorian. This would equip the twin-engine aircraft with an automatic cannon (probably 30mm), night vision sensors, laser designators, and guided missiles (like Hellfire, 70mm, and other small ones like Griffin). The weapons and sensors would be on pallets and would allow a C-27J to be quickly converted to a gunship by installing the pallets and attaching the missile launchers and sensor antennae to the outside of the aircraft. The C-27J can carry three HCU-6/E pallets. Each is 224 cm (88 inches) wide, 274 cm (108 inches) long, and 57mm (2.25 inches) high and can carry up to 4.5 tons. The pallets are loaded via the rear ramp. The first Praetorian will begin testing in early 2014 and if that goes well the Italian special operations forces will have three of them by 2016. Back in 2008, the air force portion of U.S. SOCOM (AFSOC, Air Force Special Operations Command) looked into using light (two engine) C-27J transports for ""light gunships."" This aircraft can carry 9 tons for up to 2,500 kilometers and land on smaller airfields than the four engine transports can handle. SOCOM planned to take a C-27J and mount one or two 30mm automatic cannon on it, along with the AC-130 gunship sensors and communications gear, as well as guided missiles. Called the ""AC-XX"", this C-27J experiment didn't work out (mainly for political reasons) and SOCOM stuck with the AC-130. The Italians feel there might be an international market for a twin engine gunship using the American system of pallets to quickly convert a transport into a gunship. The Praetorian will have sensors and communications gear, and some of the weapons, to be mounted on pallets, which would be placed in the aircraft via the rear cargo ramp and hooked up to aircraft power and communications systems. Some weapons (missiles) would be mounted on external racks. The Italians are encouraged by the American experience with ""instant gunships"" (Harvest Hawk and Dragon Spear). Meanwhile, U.S. SOCOM (Special Operations Command) has equipped and deployed 14 MC-130W ""Dragon Spear"" gunships since 2010. The first MC-130W arrived in Afghanistan in late 2010, and a month later it had fired one of its weapons (a Hellfire missile) for the first time (killing five Taliban). Getting 14 new gunships into action so quickly was only possible because SOCOM adopted an idea developed by the U.S. Marine Corps: the ""instant gunship."" Called ""Harvest Hawk,"" the marine instant gunship system works using weapons and sensors that can be quickly rolled into a C-130 transport and hooked up. This takes a few hours and turns the C-130 into a gunship (similar in capabilities existing on AC-130 gunships). The sensor package consists of day/night vidcams with magnification capability. The weapons currently consist of 10 Griffin missiles and 4 Hellfires. A 30mm autocannon is optional. The 15.6 kg (34.5 pound) Griffin had earlier entered service in Afghanistan aboard UAVs. The older Hellfire II weighs 48.2 kg (106 pounds), carries a 9 kg (20 pound) warhead, and has a range of 8,000 meters. The Griffin has a 5.9 kg (13 pound) warhead which is larger, in proportion to its size, than the one carried by the heavier Hellfire. Griffin has pop-out wings, allowing it to glide and thus has a longer range (15 kilometers) than Hellfire. UAVs can carry more of the smaller missiles, typically two of them in place of one Hellfire. This use of missiles instead of cannon has allowed for a major change in how gunships are used. As a result, in 2011 SOCOM, for the first time since the Vietnam War, allowed its MC-130 gunships to operate in daytime. For the last four decades it was believed too dangerous for these low, slow flying, heavily armed aircraft to operate when the sun was up. The key to this change is the use of missiles by gunships. The new, small missiles enable the slow, large, MC-130s to operate above the range of ground fire and still hit their targets. Dragon Spear is based on the earlier Harvest Hawk system, which enabled marine KC-130J tankers to be transformed into a gunship, with the addition of the portable weapons and sensors. The marines had long noted the success of the U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunships that SOCOM (Special Operations Command) uses. But they couldn't afford them, as an AC-130 costs more than three times as much as a marine KC-130J aerial refueling aircraft. But the marines developed a solution. This is something the marines often do. The KC-130J is the latest, and largest, USMC version of the C-130 transport used for aerial refueling. The KC-130J can also carry cargo and weapons (bombs and missiles) hung from the wings. Thus the Harvest Hawk version of the KC-130J adds a targeting pod, with the data going to a special cargo container containing control equipment (computers, commo, and displays) enabling operators use of the day/night sensors of the targeting pod, to fire missiles hung from the wings. The SOCOM version is the MC-130W. The original plan was to have a 30mm Bushmaster cannon fired out the door, so that there would be gunfire support as well. But this was made optional, as the 14 missiles seemed to provide sufficient firepower. It also means less for Harvest Hawk to carry. The Mk44 30mm Bushmaster cannon weighs 157 kg (344 pounds) and fires at 200 or 400 rounds per minute (up to 7 per second). The cannon has 160 rounds available, before needing a reload. That means the gunner has 25-50 seconds worth of ammo, depending on rate of fire used. Each 30mm round weighs about 714 g (25 ounces, depending on type). Explosive anti-personnel rounds are fired when used in gunships. The fire control system, and night vision sensors, enable the 30mm gunners to accurately hit targets with high explosive shells. Existing SOCOM AC-130 gunships are armed with a 105mm howitzer and a 25mm and 40mm automatic cannon. But the two smaller caliber guns are being phased out of military service. The air force is considering equipping its gunships just with smart bombs and missiles. The big thing with gunships is their sensors, not their weapons. Operating at night, the gunships can see what is going on below, in great detail. Using on-board weapons, gunships can immediately engage targets. But with the appearance of smart bombs (GPS and laser guided), aerial weapons are more available to hit any target that is found. So Harvest Hawk would be able to hit targets that were ""time sensitive"" (had to be hit before they got away) but could also call on smart bombs or laser guided missiles for targets that weren't going anywhere right away. Most of what Harvest Hawk does in Afghanistan is look for roadside bombs or the guys who plant them. These the marines want to track back to their base and then take out an entire roadside bomb operation. Ultimately, the air force and SOCOM see the potential for the Harvest Hawk/Dragon Spear approach replacing custom built AC-130 gunships. There would still be a need for specially trained gunship crews. But they, and the several cargo containers of Harvest Hawk gear, could be held ready to go wherever they are most needed. Cargo aircraft serving as gunships first appeared, using twin-engine World War II era C-47 transports, in the 1960s over Vietnam. The troops called the gunships, which liked to operate at night, ""Spooky."" The gunships quickly moved to four engine C-130 transports but the nickname stuck.

While doing so we must remember that any initiative to assist Afghanistan undertaken with inadequate preparation and not wholly executed is far more dangerous than no initiative at all,"" Singh said, articulating India's position on the peace process.



The Foreign Secretary was speaking at a meeting of senior officials representing the Istanbul Process.



Singh lauded the efforts of President Hamid Karzai for holding Presidential elections in April and observed that the polls face threats from the extremist groups.



""We think that all the building blocks for an election that will unite the whole of Afghanistan are already in place. The main threat to this election process is the continued efforts by extremist groups to undermine security and deny the Afghan citizens the right to freely exercise his or her franchise,"" she said.



Singh said there was ""never any justification"" for terrorism and India strongly believes that it was only thorough international cooperation that the evil scourge of terror will be defeated.



""Afghan President Hamid Karzai has made great efforts to ensure that required legislation for an independent Election Commission and an independent Election Complaints Commission



have been put in place in time for these elections,"" she said.



Noting that economic growth was key for Afghanistan's development, she said India held a meeting of leading businessmen recently to encourage them to do business in the country.



The Foreign Secretary said ""consistent and clear message"" received from the business community was about lack of connectivity of Afghanistan to major markets in the region.



""While they all see the potential of Afghanistan as a major economic hub for energy, raw material and trade, connectivity to the major markets of the region remains a major impediment ""The time has come to seriously discuss the issue of transit arrangements for Afghanistan that can be provided by Afghanistan's neighbours,"" Singh said.



The Foreign Secretary highlighted India's initiative to develop the Chabahar port in Iran which could act as a major transit point to Afghanistan.



Chabahar port is strategically crucial as it gives access route to Afghanistan. The port, which is surrounded by a free trade zone, is vital for transit facility from India to Afghanistan.



""India, Iran and Afghanistan are already discussing the possibilities of cooperation centred on future development of the Chabahar port in Iran and we hope to see other such projects fructify in near future,"" she said.



Singh said India was committed to work with the like-minded countries to ensure overall development of Afghanistan.







""India is committed to working together with all like minded countries to ensure that the narrative of hope and progress is acknowledge and given all the importance that it deserves,"" she said.







The Foreign Secretary also underlined the need for focusing on implementing various confidence building measures in Afghanistan ""It is important to shift gear from planning stage to implementation stage.""







Afghanistan's Deputy Foreign Minister Ershad Ahmadi said there has been an ""increasing awareness and momentum"" to deal with various challenges facing his country.







Chinese Ambassador Luo Zhaouhui said ""leading countries"" of the region must play a key role in ensuring peace and stability in Afghanistan. He also mentioned about China's push for setting up an Asean Infrastructure Bank to fund major infrastructure projects. He said it could help Afghanistan also.

http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/leisure/latest/11038516.Play_explores_the_story_of_injured_soldiers/,Play explores the story of injured soldiers,"He said following an injury of this kind you don't know who you are any more but this ground breaking show gave him back his sense of being. It is coming to Aylesbury next month.

In the centenary anniversary of the outbreak of World War 1, The Two Worlds of Charlie F, which was first performed in January 2012 at two charity fund-raising evenings at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, will start a new UK tour in 2014 at Aylesbury Waterside Theatre.

The play is a soldier's view of service, injury and recovery from the war in Afghanistan to the morphine induced physiotherapy rooms. It will be performed by medically discharged military personnel, as well as professional actors.

Cassidy plays the lead role of Marine Charlie Fowler and has been part of it from the beginning when he first met writer Owen Sheers.

He said: ""I was at Headley Court. It was about two and a half months after being injured in Afghanistan. I was told there is a writer and director in the common room who are thinking about doing a small in-theatre show about injured service men before and after injury. Why don’t you give it a go? I thought let’s do it.

""That is the neat part of the show- we were all involved in the writing. Owen Sheers wrote it- he is a beautiful poet- an amazing poet. He imposed himself in with us. He didn’t live with us and brush our hair. He got involved every day for hours and hours and just asked us questions.

""Not questions like what’s your favourite colour or do you hide crayons when you are bored but tell me about some funny things that happen in the forces; tell me things you regret. He went through a long list of things like that.""

Cassidy, who was born in Canada and did performance arts in the US, said Owen then went away and came up with the script for the play. So how did he feel when he saw the final result?

He said: ""I was a little agitated- he had given 80 per cent of the dialogue to me. I was kind of sitting there on enough drugs to kill a small animal at the time. I said What are you doing? You are killing me here. How am I going to upload this into this polluted brain of mine.""

But of course, he did, and the show has had an amazing response. The tour, which will be supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England, will be supporting The Royal British Legion by raising funds at each performance.

The cast will also include ex-servicemen and women Bombardier (Rtd) Gareth Crabbe, Rifleman (Rtd) Daniel Shaw, Darren ""Swifty"" Swift and Lieutenant Col (Rtd) Stewart Hill. So does he get nervous before a show?

Cassidy said: ""There is always a part of me that thinks at this one performance I will be judged and our stories will be judged. And I worry they would be not cheers of approval but rather because it is a forces show with a bunch of disabled people on stage.

""But I have to be confident. Like at past performances there have been standing ovations every night and on their feet every time we have done. And they are not standing because we are disabled but because it is a good show. I have to believe that.""

He moved to Britain to become a stand up comedian, and then because of a bet, he joined the Marines. Really? A bet?

He said: ""I am a man who likes getting in the river and seeing where it goes. If I get bored I just paddle faster- that is simple.

""I was given the opportunity to come to the UK and not because I thought I might join the Marines or be a stand up comedian but because I was jumping in the river to see where it goes.""

He has been in the Marines for eight years and was on his second tour with 42 Commando near Nad-e-Ali in Helmand in May 2011 when the medic was blow up after his patrol set off an old IED. Two Marines were killed.

Cassidy, who was the poster boy for the Royal British Legion's poppy appeal last year, said: ""I don’t block things out- I explore everything. I have no regrets. If I had to do everything again then I would step two feet to the right instead. ""I lost some good friends that day. That is the part I feel sad about. If I could change anything I would change that.""

And he said the play gave him something to focus and on and something to be proud of. He said he felt very determined at the first show.

He said: ""We are all insecure, especially when the ego takes such a battering as losing a leg or a leg covered in scars or a brain injury. You don’t know who you are. Your body recovers a lot quicker than your mind does.""

And he means ego in your sense of being and who you are.

He added: ""That takes a real clattering when you get blown up. You become self conscious about even leaving the house. You stay at home and play video games and drink vodka. You get paid by the military and get time off.""

He said: ""I will always be recovering from an injury which is the unfortunate truth of this beautiful tale. Any injured serviceman will spend the rest of their life recovering from it. That is a fact- not negative or positive. It is as simple as that.""

The play will be directed once again by Stephen Rayne, with music by Jason Carr, design by Anthony Lamble, lighting and projection design by Will Reynolds, sound by Colin Pink and choreography by Lilly Phillips. And what is it about the show which people have been drawn to?

Cassidy said: ""You don’t need to be in the military to relive the trauma. We are living on an overcrowded planet right now- there is a lot of trauma going on around here...

""You don’t have to lose your leg in Afghanistan to know what it is like to go through trauma. You don’t feel you belong in a normal society- you feel something wrong has happened.

""When you watch the show it is about people who have found the strength to go off and do incredible things.""

During the visit, the Crowned Prince held talks with the President, the Prime Minister and other high level officials. The nature of the frequent visits mirrored the level of understanding, affection and mutual respect between the people of Pakistan and the Saudi Kingdom.

A call was made by both sides to take advantage of the opportunities available in both countries, to further strengthen cooperation in various fields and to fortify existing political relations between both countries. Both sides also expressed the need to improve bilateral cooperation in the field of defense and the importance of completing necessary measures for signing of the agreements and MoUs in various fields.

On international issues, the two sides echoed the need of finding a quick solution of the existing conflict in Syria; one that would reinstate peace and security in the country and protect the Syrians from further harm. Both sides called for an immediate withdrawal of all foreign armed forces and elements from Syrian territory, lifting siege of the Syrian towns and villages, setting up of safe corridors and regions to deliver food and humanitarian aid to besieged Syrian citizens. Foreign fighters are believed to be prolonging the Syrian war.

Regarding Palestine, the two sides reaffirmed their consistent stand to support the Palestinian right to arrive at a just solution which means standing against Israeli practices. They believe peace efforts should be based on Arab peace initiatives and the relevant UN Resolutions.

http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/06/25/eight-taliban-fighters-attack-afghan-presidential-palace,Taliban Fighters Attack Presidential Palace,"Eight Taliban fighters waged a brazen offensive on the Afghan presidential palace on Tuesday, using false papers to sneak vehicles packed with explosives through checkpoints before jumping out and opening fire on the compound.

The Associated Press reports fighters in one of the vehicles got caught between two checkpoints and detonated their bomb. All of the insurgents died in the attack and one security guard was wounded by gunfire.

The daylight attack on the fortified compound, which also serves as the headquarters for the U.S. Embassy and NATO-led coalition troops, comes amid potential peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban, which have infuriated the Afghan government. It also followed an announcement last week that Afghan forces are now taking the lead in the country's security operations.

James Cunningham, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, condemned the attacks in a written statement early Tuesday and persisted in hopes for a diplomatic solution.

""All of the attackers were killed, without success in achieving their goals,"" Cunningham said. ""This again demonstrates the futility of the Taliban's efforts to use violence and terror to achieve their aims.""

He called on the Taliban to return to the negotiating table to discuss peace and reconciliation.

""We remain steadfast in supporting the Afghan government and people against the scourge of terrorism and the violence directed against them,"" he said.

The attack came a week after the Taliban raised a flag for the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,"" used during their pre-2001 rule of the country, over its delegation office in Doha, Qatar ahead of planned peace talks there. The Afghan government is still waiting for answers on how this happened.

Tuesday's attack a few hours after sunrise was witnessed by journalists waiting to cover an event in which Afghan President Hamid Karzai would speak with children about the peace efforts with the Taliban.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the militant political group was responsible for the attack via an email statement to the AP. The eight bombers wielded hand grenades, a machine gun and rocket-propelled grenades and were able to reach ""the most secure area of Kabul,"" he said. They were targeting the CIA headquarters, the palace and the Afghan Ministry of Defense.

These unconfirmed tweets depict the heavily fortified presidential palace in what appears to be the aftermath of the attack:

The six who were employed by French orgnisation Acted, were shot dead on Wednesday morning and a colleague was wounded in the northern Afghan problem of

Faryab, local police chief Nabi Jan Mullakhail announced.

They were dragged from their car in the Pashtun Kot district of Faryab province, which borders Turkmenistan, before being gunned down, he said.

He blamed Taliban insurgents fighting international forces and forces loyal to the government of President Hamid Karzai.

The news was confirmed by Faryab development projects chief Mohammad Alem Murad.

Acted released a statement from Paris condemning the killings and correcting an earlier report that the death toll was seven.

""Six Afghan employees were killed following an ambush that targeted a team of seven people. One person was injured,"" it said. ""They were killed in the course of their work to support the developement in the north. We deplore the deaths of our colleagues while they were carrying out their duties.""

Acted, which is based in Paris, works on development projects in 31 countries.

It was founded in Afghanistan in 1993 and has 34 projects there, employing 864 local staff and 13 international staff, according to its website.

Although they have reduced the number of attacks on schools and clinics under local pressure, some Taliban regard NGOs, especially foreign ones, as agents of the international intervention that drove them out of power in 2001.

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130624000998,‘Soft’ partition may be best for Afghanistan,"NEW DELHI ― The United States, still mired in a protracted war in Afghanistan that has exacted a staggering cost in blood and treasure, will formally open peace talks with the Taliban, its main battlefield opponent, in the coming days (apparently despite last-minute opposition from Afghan President Hamid Karzai). With the U.S. determined to withdraw its forces after more than a decade of fighting, the talks in Doha, Qatar, are largely intended to allow it to do so “honorably.”

How the end of U.S.-led combat operations shapes Afghanistan’s future will affect the security of countries nearby and beyond. Here the most important question is whether the fate of Afghanistan, which was created as a buffer between Czarist Russia and British India, will be ― or should be ― different from that of Iraq and Libya (two other imperial creations where the U.S. has intervened militarily in recent years).

Foreign military intervention can effect regime change, but it evidently cannot reestablish order based on centralized government. Iraq has been partitioned in all but name into Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish regions, while Libya seems headed toward a similar tripartite, tribal-based territorial arrangement. In Afghanistan, too, an Iraq-style “soft” partition may be the best possible outcome.

Afghanistan’s large ethnic groups already enjoy de facto autonomy, which they secured after their Northern Alliance played a central role in the U.S.-led ouster of the Taliban from power in late 2001. Having enjoyed virtual self-rule since then, they will fiercely resist falling back under the sway of the Pashtuns, who have ruled the country for most of its history.

For their part, the Pashtuns, despite their tribal divisions, will not be content with control of a rump Afghanistan consisting of its current eastern and southeastern provinces. They will eventually seek integration with fellow Pashtuns in Pakistan, across the British-drawn Durand Line ― a border that Afghanistan has never recognized. The demand for a “Greater Pashtunistan” would then challenge the territorial integrity of Pakistan (itself another artificial imperial construct).

The fact that Afghanistan’s ethnic groups are concentrated in distinct geographical zones would simplify partition and make the resulting borders more likely to last, unlike those drawn by colonial officials, who invented countries with no national identity or historical roots. Indeed, both geographically and demographically, Afghanistan’s non-Pashtun groups account for more than half of the country, with Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras alone making up close to 50 percent of the population.

After waging the longest war in its history, at a cost of tens of thousands of lives and nearly a trillion dollars, the U.S. is combat-weary and financially strapped. But the American effort to cut a deal with the Pashtun-based, Pakistan-backed Taliban is stirring deep unease among the non-Pashtun groups, which suffered greatly under the Taliban and its five-year rule. (The historically persecuted Hazaras, for example, suffered several large-scale massacres.)

While Karzai has been fickle, to say the least, about cooperation with the Americans (indeed, he has since backed away from participation in the Doha talks), the rupture of his political alliance with non-Pashtun leaders has also fueled ethnic polarization. Some non-Pashtun power brokers continue to support Karzai, but many others are now leading the opposition National Front.

These leaders are unlikely to accept any power-sharing arrangement that includes the Taliban. In fact, they suspect that Karzai’s ultimate goal is to restore Pashtun dominance throughout Afghanistan.

Their misgivings have been strengthened by the “Peace Process Roadmap to 2015,” a document prepared by the Karzai-constituted Afghan High Peace Council that sketches several potential concessions to the Taliban and Pakistan, ranging from the Taliban’s recognition as a political party to a role for Pakistan in Afghanistan’s internal affairs. The roadmap even dangles the carrot of cabinet posts and provincial governorships to prominent Taliban figures.

The most serious problem today is that the country’s ethnic tensions and recriminations threaten to undermine the cohesion of the fledgling, multiethnic Afghan Army. Indeed, the splits today resemble those that occurred when Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, an exit that led to civil war and the Taliban’s eventual capture of the capital, Kabul.

This time, the non-Pashtun communities are better armed and prepared to defend their interests after the U.S. withdrawal. Thus, in seeking to co-opt the Taliban, the U.S. is not only bestowing legitimacy on a thuggish militia; it also risks unwittingly reigniting Afghanistan’s ethnic strife, which would most likely tear the country apart for good.

This raises a fundamental question: Is Afghanistan’s territorial unity really essential for regional or international security?

To be sure, the sanctity of existing borders has become a powerful norm in world politics. Yet this norm has permitted the emergence of ungovernable and unmanageable states, whose internal wars spill across international boundaries, fueling regional tensions and insecurity.

With a war-exhausted U.S. having run out of patience, outside forces are in no position to prevent Afghanistan’s partition along Iraqi (or even post-Yugoslav) lines, with the bloodiest battles expected to rage over control of ethnically mixed strategic areas, including Kabul. In this scenario, Pakistani generals, instead of continuing to sponsor Afghan Pashtun militant groups (like the Taliban and their allies like the Haqqani network), would be compelled to fend off a potentially grave threat to Pakistan’s unity.

A weak, partitioned Afghanistan may not be a desirable outcome; but a “soft” partition now would be far better than a “hard” partition later, after years of chaos and bloodletting ― and infinitely better than the medieval Taliban’s return to power and a fresh reign of terror. Indeed, partition may be the only way to prevent Afghanistan from sliding into large-scale civil war and to thwart transnational terrorists from reestablishing a base of operations in the rubble.

According to them, there should be no further delay in the extension work as the hospital is catering to the needs of a large number of people and the present building does not have the capacity to fulfil the requirements of all.

They said with the completion of expansion plan, more facilities will be available for patients and the hospital will offer modern healthcare equipment.

Aleem Khan, a citizen said that the Polyclinic is situated in the centre of the city and asked the authorities concerned to take immediate steps for its up-gradation to serve the patients.

He said due to limited space and lack of facilities, patients have been facing a lot of problems including limited beds, limited emergency staff and other employees of the hospital besides medical equipment.

Another patient, Imran Khalil said the authorities concerned should avoid further delay in the project as it was the dire need to start work on hospital extension plan keeping in view the patients burden.

He said that the incumbent government should take action against those who are intentionally delaying the hospital extension plan.

He said that extension project will ensure better health facilities at hospital for patients.

When contacted an official from the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination said that the government is planning vertical and horizontal extension of the FGPC hospital, in a purpose built structure.

He said that the additional 2.54 acres land was allocated from the adjacent Argentina Park in ­2015. A PC-­II for extension of FGPC amounting to Rs47.896 million has already been approved by Department Development Working Party (DDWP).

He said that the Planning Commission has allocated Rs 100 million for extension of FGPC with regard to its construction while Rs12 million for feasibility study in the last financial year 2017-­18. He however, said that the amount has been surrendered, due to court case.

He said that the case is under trial in Islamabad High Court Islamabad.

The statement comes days after media reports quoted U.S. authorities as saying the Obama administration has renewed efforts at talks with the Afghan insurgent group to trade five senior Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.



This is the first direct confirmation from either side that talks have taken place in recent weeks between the United States and the Taliban on a possible exchange of prisoners before the planned withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Afghanistan in December.



A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, in a statement issued Sunday says its representatives were conducting the discussions through their “political office” in Qatar, and authorities in the gulf state acted as mediators.



Under the reported proposed deal, five Taliban detainees would be released from Guantanamo prison to protective custody in Qatar in exchange for U.S. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured nearly five years ago (June 2009). The 27-year-old American soldier is the only known U.S. prisoner of war in Afghanistan. He was last seen in a video released in December.



The Taliban spokesman says the footage was released as a “proof of life” demanded by the United States to ensure progress in the secret discussions on the possible exchange of prisoners.



However, he added the Taliban has decided to suspend the talks for some time “due to the political complexity of the current situation” in Afghanistan. Without elaborating, he said that “the prisoner exchange process stands delayed until further notice.""



White House spokesman Jay Carney in a recent news conference (last Tuesday) explained the United States continues to call for and work towards Sgt. Bergdahl’s safe and immediate release. But he stopped short of offering direct comments on reported contacts with the Taliban on the issue.



“We are not involved in active negotiations with the Taliban,"" said Carney. ""If negotiations were to resume, we would certainly press the case of Sergeant Bergdahl. In the meantime, we are actively engaged in an effort to see his return. I can’t document every effort, but that includes our military, our intelligence and our diplomatic tools.”



Media reports suggest attempts to arrange the exchange of prisoners are part of wider U.S. efforts to jump-start a troubled peace and reconciliation process between the Afghan government and the Taliban that stalled in June.



U.S.-led coalition combat troops are preparing to leave Afghanistan in December, prompting fears the Taliban will try to capitalize on the absence of international forces. A proposed residual American military presence past 2014 to assist Afghan security forces remains uncertain because President Hamid Karzai has so far refused to sign a bilateral security pact with the United States.



The threat was highlighted by Sunday’s Taliban assault on an Afghan military outpost that killed at least 19 soldiers. The attack occurred in a province that borders Pakistan and has prompted the Afghan president to postpone his planned visit to Sri Lanka.",Q1

Countercurrents.org

Dear President Maduro, slanderous Western media, promoting war and violence for capital gains of the mercilessly amoral automaton functioning speculative interest banking industry, has put you in their spotlight to better target you with defamation. This is then your opportunity to be heard a bit world-wide. In telling the truth about the USA, you will be protecting all of us, Venezuela included.

Good President Maduro, please don't argue with the likes of Obama, or McCain, John Kerry or others guilty of so many documented murderous crimes against humanity. Remember, their handlers on Wall Street control most of the world's media, which will twist whatever you say about Venezuela as it twists what is happening in your country and in Syria, the Ukraine, in Afghanistan and a dozen other places.

President Maduro, please, please, quote Martin Luther King Jr.! Your government is in the gun-sights of the superpower and it allies for the usual predatory business expectations. Quote King the way Chavez quoted Noam Chomsky to the UN General Assembly. Quote King crying out, ""my own government is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world!""

Tell Americans and the world that the corporate media that works to destroy the beautiful Chavista peaceful revolution for a government of all Venezuelans and not just mostly for the rich, is the same media Martin Luther King condemned for lying and promoting US ""atrocity wars and covert violence on three continents, since 1945, meant to maintain unjust predatory investments""

Have Telesur repeat it as a sound bite! ""atrocity wars and covert violence meant to maintain unjust predatory investments on three continents!"" Yes, that's right that American ikon, Rev. Martin Luther King, the only American with a national holiday on his birthday said this, and gave the gory details of the true and bloody history of US genocide in Vietnam and elsewhere.

Millions upon millions of people in the USA and around the world will be just as shocked as when King thundered these words nearly a half-century ago in a sermon that held all Americans responsible, including himself for, yes, ""atrocity wars and covert violence meant to maintain unjust predatory investments on three continents!""

Millions will ask, did King really say what the President of Venezuela says he said?: ""my own government is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world!"" and that it runs ""atrocity wars and covert violence meant to maintain unjust predatory investments on three continents.""

Why? Because once King was silenced with a bullet to his brain, these same deadly criminal conglomerate owned media with satellite overseas reach, have made sure no one hears even a mention of King's condemnation of his own government for the ""death of a million in Vietnam, mostly children,"" never have heard of King's words, ""They languish under our bombs and consider us ... the real enemy,"" """"A time comes when silence is betrayal."" And that time has come for us."" [Beyond Vietnam sermon] http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm

Dear President Maduro, former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark would like to see an international call for justice and the US brought before the law for a ""US foreign policy that is the greatest crime since World War II."" [The Fire this Time, US Crimes in the Gulf War]

Ramsey Clark, along with peoples historian Howard Zinn, is a co-founder of the Martin Luther King Condemned US Wars International Awareness Campaign*, and supports seeding confidence in the public consciousness world wide, that sooner of later, citizens and entities of the United States of North America will be sued for genocidal crimes against humanity and crimes against peace, for compensation for wrongful death in the millions, and injuries in the tens of millions, and for reparations for massive destruction and theft of natural resources, at a cost that will make future wars and covert violence to maintain predatory investments unprofitable. The former US Attorney General is also co-founder of Prosecute US Crimes Against Humanity Now. http://prosecuteuscrimesagainsthumanitynow.blogspot.com/ *http://kingcondemneduswars.blogspot.com/

President Maduro, if, while you are now in the limelight, point to US crimes against humanity, perhaps you will be joined enthusiastically by presidents of other US attacked, beleaguered and threatened nations: Presidents like Bashar al Assad of Syria, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Hassan Rouhani of Iran and Raul Castro of Cuba.

Remind the world of American genocide in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Iraq; USA CIA violent overthrows of democratic governments in Greece, Iran, Congo, Guatemala, Chile, Haiti, Honduras; of its Armed Forces invasions of the Dominican Republic, Panama, Cuba, Grenada, Nicaragua, its naval shelling of Lebanon, bombing of Libya, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen; funding al Qaida's genocidal destruction of Syria; US support for vicious US banking favoring brutal military dictatorships throughout the world and especially throughout Latin America as in Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia with years massacres in El Salvador and Guatemala.

The planned overthrow of your government is difficult to argue against, the enemy owns too much scurrilous and omnipresent media. But calling attention to the documentation of more bombs than in all of WWII on the agrarian Buddhist population of the small French colony of Vietnam? - a million and half dead in furious war in Iraq? - both wars shrugged off as mistakes? Just Indochina and Iraq taken together maybe as much as seven million lives. Mistake? Even if would be adjudicated as manslaughter and not genocide, compensation for wrongful death, injuries, destruction of property and theft of natural resources is due! And there is no statute of time limitations for murder or manslaughter.

Did Chavez not call for justice for all victims of the USA, and not just Venezuela, and in doing so, helped everyone and helped defend Venezuela as well? While criminal media can put you, President Maduro, in a bad light for half the world, you can turn the tables on the neo-colonialist media by reminding the whole world that the problem is not Venezuela, but the genocidal use of US military and CIA in dozens of nations that is not being prosecuted under the universally recognized Nuremberg Principles;

laws not meant only for Germans, but for citizens of all nations as stated in Nuremberg by US Chief Prosecutor Robert Jackson. Gen. Telford Turner, Consul for the Prosecution at Nuremberg, during the US war in Vietnam told CBS in an interview that was suppressed, ""I would have been glad to lead the prosecution of US bomber pilots shot down over Vietnam.""[Bomber Pilot McCain: War Heroism or War Crimes? by CBS's Robert Richter]

As the United State of (North) America knocks off and destroys country after country it is time someone of character like yourself speaks up for justice for all citizens of victim nations of the long sixty-four year apocalypse of US-NATO neocolonial imperialism.

We will be hanging on your words as you brave this latest US intention to overthrow your government.

American Forces Press Service

WASHINGTON, Aug. 5, 2013 – Sharpened by the past decade of combat operations, NATO forces are launching an ambitious effort to build on that foundation and to enhance the capabilities of the NATO Response Force, the top U.S. and NATO commander reported.

""After more than 10 years of experience fighting together in Afghanistan, we have achieved an unprecedented level of cohesiveness among allies and partners,"" Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe and commander of U.S. European Command, said in his new blog posting.

""We are operating as a seamless integrated team right now, and we aim to maintain this level of cohesion … by intensifying our education, training and exercises across the air, land and sea domains,"" he said.

Breedlove, who presided at Aug. 2 ceremonies during which Air Force Gen. Frank Gorenc assumed command of Allied Air Command, U.S. Air Forces Europe and U.S. Air Forces Africa, as well as directorship of the Joint Air Power Competence Center, called air power a key pillar of NATO's deterrence.

Several upcoming exercises will take the integration demonstrated during Operation Unified Protector in Libya to the next level, with a goal of ensuring the units and Headquarters Air Command are prepared to assume the NATO Response Force mission in 2014, Breedlove reported.

The first of them, Exercise Brilliant Arrow, will kick off later this month in central Norway. Forty fighter aircraft, two airborne early warning platforms and about 800 participants will face a tough, realistic scenario that includes air defense units on the ground, he said.

Breedlove emphasized the importance of ensuring that air power remains ready and capable despite current economic uncertainties. This will be critical, he said, to prepare for the future security environment that will require NATO's airpower to adapt to the speed and unpredictability of strategic and technological developments.

The general also underscored the continued importance of NATO's airborne early warning and surveillance and air policing missions and their peacetime role in preserving the integrity of NATO European airspace and safeguarding NATO nations from air attacks.

""But airpower is just one part of the NATO team. We must also train hard on the land and the sea,"" Breedlove said.

Exercise Brilliant Mariner, to begin in late September, will focus on training and certifying the readiness of maritime forces for their NATO Response Force rotation, he reported.

On land, Special Forces are preparing for the Exercise Brilliant Sword in Italy in October. The following month, several alliance nations, including the Baltic states and Poland, will participate in Exercise Steadfast Jazz. That exercise will bring together air, land, maritime and Special Forces components, as well as the headquarters staff from Joint Force Command Brunssum, which will lead NATO joint operations next year.

Breedlove emphasized the importance of exercises to NATO readiness.

""My aim is to make sure that our NRF deployable headquarters and troops are ready to deal with any situation in any environment,"" he said. ""The NRF and associated training is essential in maintaining and enhancing the ability of forces from across the alliance to work together.""

That, Breedlove emphasized, ""will be increasingly important as our mission in Afghanistan winds down and we prepare to meet future challenges.""

http://isnblog.ethz.ch/government/saudi-arabia-syria-and-bin-ladens-ghost,"Saudi Arabia, Syria and Bin Laden’s Ghost","This article was originally published by the Middle East Institute on 14 February 2014.

Osama bin Laden may be dead, but his ghost was in Riyadh the other day, hovering over Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah as he issued a decree making it a crime for any Saudi citizen to take part in a war outside the kingdom.

The obvious motivator was the civil war in Syria, where hundreds of young Saudis have been spotted in the ranks of the most radical jihadi groups battling both the government and other less extreme rebels. But the roots of the king’s action, and the problem it was designed to address, can be traced to the 1980s war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

In that conflict, the Afghan mujahidin were joined by units of religiously-motivated young Arabs, who saw themselves as soldiers of Allah struggling against an atheistic enemy. When that war ended in victory, these so-called “Afghan Arabs” returned to their home countries, including Saudi Arabia, energized by their cause, experienced in battle, and looking for new targets. The best-known of these militants was Osama bin Laden, and the target he chose was the al-Saud monarchy.

Bin Laden himself was sent into exile, but his acolytes, branding themselves al-Qa`ida in the Arabian Peninsula, began an armed uprising against the government in 2003. The insurrection eventually failed, but the kingdom’s rulers, who had encouraged the Afghan Arab movement, learned a harsh lesson: jihadis wage jihad, at home if not abroad.

This issue surfaced during the U.S.-led war in Iraq, when the Saudi government struggled to discourage young men from joining forces with Sunni militias, fearing what would happen when they came home. Now this phenomenon has metastasized in Syria, where there is no end in sight to the war. Restless young Saudi men, with few job prospects at home, have found it appealing to travel to Syria via Jordan or Turkey to join the ranks of the militants. Reports that Egyptian fighters who had been in Syria were attacking security forces in their home country validated Saudi fears of blowback.

The Saudi government has openly supported some of the Syrian rebels, and has been criticized for what appeared to be half-hearted or insincere attempts to keep the would-be warriors at home. Jamie Dettmer wrote for the Daily Beast, for example, that, “Saudi Arabia is playing a dangerous double game—turning a blind eye to the jihadists flocking from Riyadh to Syria while assuring the West of its commitment to fighting terror.”[1] Another article mentioned that the Saudis were going to Syria “with tacit approval from the House of Saud and financial support from wealthy Saudi elites.”[2] The New York Times reported last month that although Saudis were officially prohibited from going to Syria, “the ban is not enforced.”[3]

In December, the United States cut off non-lethal aid to Syrian rebels that it had been supporting because of concerns about rising extremist violence in the country. It might be difficult for King Abdullah to meet President Obama next month as scheduled with the issue of Saudi participation in the extremist groups hanging over him, especially since some of the jihadi bands in Syria have shown themselves to be so extreme and violent that even the leadership of al-Qa`ida has disavowed them. The king and the president have enough disagreements to address without adding this one.

In issuing his decree, which as usual for such documents included Qur’anic verses to show that it was based on the principles of Islam, the king did not specify any country. He said it was aimed at misguided people who were “targeting security, stability, tranquility and public tranquility and damaging the status of the Kingdom at the Arab, Islamic and international levels as well as its relations with other countries…”[4]

The decree establishes prison terms of three to 20 years for any Saudi citizen “participating in hostilities outside the Kingdom, in any way.”[5] The same sentences are to be applied to those joining or supporting “radical religious or intellectual currents or groups, and the like, or those classified as terrorist organizations internally, regionally or internationally, or supporting or adopting its ideology or approach in any way, or vowing sympathy with it.”[6] If the offender is a member of the armed forces, the penalty range rises to five to 30 years.

The king ordered the Ministries of Justice, Interior, Foreign Affairs and Islamic Affairs to draw up a list of groups that will be covered. When the law takes effect next month after publication in the official gazette, the king ordered, the Ministry of Interior is to “submit to us without delay the occurrence of arrests, apprehensions, investigation, and prosecution on the crimes mentioned.”[7]

It is always possible in Saudi Arabia that such a law could be used to stifle domestic dissent: anyone getting out of line could be accused of sympathizing with groups that jeopardize “tranquility,” and thrown into prison. But the Saudi government already has plenty of laws it can use to lock up dissidents, and it often does so. It is more likely that the new law reflects a genuine anxiety among the kingdom’s leaders about the potential for trouble when fighters come home from Syria, and about the outside world’s suspicion of their motives.

A jury in the defamation case against Defence Force chief Lieutenant General Rhys Jones by a freelance journalist has retired for the evening after going out to consider their verdict this afternoon.

Journalist Jon Stephenson is seeking $500,000 and costs from General Jones in the High Court at Wellington.

The jury of five women and seven men began their deliberation about 3.30pm.

Stephenson is suing General Jones for defamation over a Defence Force statement about articles written by Stephenson during 2010 and 2011.

BRAGG, N.C. — A military judge refused Tuesday to dismiss sexual assault charges against a one-star general, rejecting defense allegations that the Army has unfairly prosecuted the case in response to political pressure to crack down on sexual abuse in the ranks.

The ruling came after searing testimony about the emotional breakdown last month of the then-lead military prosecutor, described as irrational and suicidal in the days before he quit the case. Lawyers for Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair had cited comments by the former prosecutor, Lt. Col. William Helixon, in alleging “unlawful command influence” by the Army chain of command.

Helixon was described in testimony by a fellow military legal officer as “crying, irrational, incoherent” and a “functional alcoholic” holed up in a Washington, D.C., luxury hotel on the weekend of Feb. 8 and 9. Brig. Gen. Paul Wilson, a senior Army legal officer at the Pentagon, said he took Helixon to a military hospital in Virginia because he appeared suicidal.

“I’ve never seen a human being so stripped of logic and rationality,” Wilson testified, adding that he feared Helixon would deliberately step in front of a bus.

In seeking the dismissal, Sinclair’s lawyer has cited a one-hour phone call from Helixon on Feb. 9, in which he allegedly expressed serious misgivings about the Army’s handling of the case. Defense lawyer Richard L. Scheff said Helixon concluded that a female captain who accused Sinclair of forced oral sex had lied on the stand and that the general was not guilty of sexual assault.

Sinclair, 51, is charged with forcing a female captain to twice perform oral sex after she allegedly tried to break off their three-year affair, and threatening to kill her and her family if she revealed the affair. The charges are based on statements by the accuser, a captain who was 29 when the relationship began.

In addition to testimony from military lawyers about Helixon, the current lead prosecutor cross-examined Sinclair’s lawyer. At issue was what Helixon may have said about unlawful command influence and the accuser’s credibility — and whether that was relevant to how the Army prosecuted the case.

The judge, Col. James L. Pohl, ruled that the defense had not proved unlawful command influence in the Army’s rejection of Sinclair’s offer to plead guilty to adultery and conduct unbecoming an officer. Merely rejecting the plea was not evidence of improper command or political interference, Pohl said.

However, the judge said a memo from the accuser’s special victim lawyer to a three-star general who turned down the plea offer was “inappropriate” and “does cause concern.’’

Advertisement

The victim’s advocate, Capt. Cassie L. Fowler, wrote to the three-star general that accepting Sinclair’s plea would “have an adverse affect on my client and the Army’s fight against sexual assault.”

Sinclair’s case has played out at a time of heightened political and public concern about sexual assault in the military – and the role of commanders in deciding whether to bring charges. He faces life in prison if convicted on all charges.

The day’s testimony detailed weeks of furious back-and-forth negotiations in a highly publicized case. Lawyers from both sides described the internal dynamics of a rare court-martial of an active-duty general.

Scheff was questioned by his co-counsel and cross-examined by lead prosecutor Lt. Col. Robert Stelle. Two top Army legal officers were cross-examined by the defense team.

The prosecution framed Helixon’s comments as those of a man in severe emotional distress because of concerns about his father’s health, marital issues, his own drinking and pressures of the case. The defense portrayed Helixon as ethically bound to quit a case he concluded was built on politically motivated charges.

Scheff testified that Helixon told him that the prosecution was “driven by politics” and that everyone on the prosecution team had grave doubts about proving the most serious charges against Sinclair. He said Helixon refused to stay on the case unless those charges were dropped.

Stelle said Helixon had tactical concerns about proving the sexual assault charges beyond a reasonable doubt. But he said such concerns are common in “he said, she said” sexual assault cases like Sinclair’s.

Stelle argued that any comments by Helixon were his personal opinions.

“No offense to Lt. Col. Helixon, I don’t really care what he thinks,” Stelle told the judge. “Who cares? Counsels talk about cases all the time. That’s what we do.”

A prosecution witness, Lt. Col. Jerrett Dunlap, the top legal officer at Ft. Bragg, testified that no one on the prosecution team received pressure or undue influence from the chain of command. He said there were no concerns among prosecutors over charges against Sinclair not holding up in court.

Wilson said he rushed to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel when told that Helixon was drinking and acting irrationally.

Wilson said Helixon was distraught over January testimony by the accuser; forensic experts concluded that she lied on the stand about a cellphone containing messages from Sinclair. The accuser testified that she belatedly found the phone in December while unpacking boxes from Afghanistan.

Prosecutors said that although Helixon had concerns about the accuser’s phone testimony, neither he nor any other prosecutor doubted that she was telling the truth about the sexual assault. The captain testified in pretrial hearings that Sinclair grabbed her hair and forced her head down while demanding oral sex when both served in Afghanistan.

Wilson testified that Helixon said of the accuser’s cellphone statements: “She lied to me.... Why would she lie to me?”

Asked by Scheff whether he ever called Sinclair “the poster child for sexual assault,” Wilson said he didn’t recall. Asked whether he agreed with Helixon that the accuser had lied about the phone, he said he was not familiar with her testimony.

“I was concerned about saving a human being,” he said of Helixon.

Questioned by Stelle, Wilson said, “Frankly, I would’ve told him anything to get him into my car” to reach a hospital for mental health counseling. Wilson said he told Helixon’s superior that he was in no condition to remain on the case.

“He was absolutely not fit for any kind of duty. I wouldn’t let him drive a car,’’ Wilson said.

Pohl signaled earlier Tuesday that he was unconvinced by defense allegations of unlawful command influence. When defense lawyer Lathrop Nelson said Helixon had “concluded that this case was infected by politics,” the judge shot back, “That’s just his opinion.”

Afterward, Scheff said the prosecution “undertook a vicious character assault against someone they previously called their `rock star’ sex crimes prosecutor, because he was the only Army leader with the integrity to stand up to politics.’’

The court-martial resumes Wednesday with questioning of the five-member jury panel, composed of generals senior in rank to Sinclair. Opening arguments are expected Thursday.

In addition to sexual assault and sodomy, Sinclair is charged with adultery, pressuring two other female officers to send him nude photos, possessing pornography and abusing his government charge card to pursue liaisons with the captain

Charges of possessing alcohol in a war zone were dropped. The defense said Sinclair had received a gift bottle of liquor but had never cracked the seal.

Fundraiser for Gaza hospital to be held in Dearborn

A fundraising drive for the Shifa hospital and other humanitarian causes in Gaza is to be held at Riverside Academy, 7124 Miller Road in Dearborn, on Saturday Jan. 10 at 5 p.m.

The group Palestinian Unity organized the effort. Funds are to be sent to Gaza through the Palestinian Aid Society, www.palestineaidsociety.org for medical aid and ten group Islamic Relief, www.irw.org, for humanitarian aid.

According to aid workers, doctors in Gaza are struggling to treat the injured and are lacking essential medical supplies. Gaza’s 1.5 million residents were already facing the region’s worst humanitarian crisis in 30 years before the current crisis, exacerbated by the limited mobility of aid workers, depleted supplies and a massive increase of those in critical need.

California-based aid organization Islamic Relief has launched a multi-million dollar humanitarian appeal to ease suffering in the ongoing crisis. The group has an established, internationally recognized office and staff in Gaza able to provide medicine and food aid.

“The children are terrified. Adults are unable to provide them with security or warmth. Hospitals are stretched out of the limits. We need blood and medicine and surgical equipment,” said Eyad El-Sarraj, director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program.

Other fundraising efforts through Islamic Relief and other groups are being organized locally.

Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on Jarrar’s behalf.

ACLU attorney Aden Fine said, “This settlement should send a clear message to all TSA officials and airlines that they cannot discriminate against passengers based on their race or the ethnic content of their speech.”

The settlement was announced just days after the airline AirTran removed a Muslim family of nine heading to Orlando. AirTran refused to let the family fly on the airline even after they were questioned and cleared by the FBI.

http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2013/10/23/afghanistans-next-first-lady-could-be-a-christian/,Afghanistan's Next First Lady Could be a Christian,"Afghanistan’s Khaama Press yesterday reported that 10 candidates have qualified to run to replace President Hamid Karzai in the 2014 elections.

Sixteen other candidates were eliminated for reasons such as dual nationality or not gathering 100,000 voter signatures toward their election bid.

One of the candidates is Abdullah Abdullah, second from the right on the top row, a doctor and former adviser in the Northern Alliance that battled the Taliban and al-Qaeda before the coalition invasion. Abdullah was appointed foreign minister in the interim administration and held that position through the first permanent administration, stepping down in 2005. Citing Karzai’s corruption, Abdullah ran for president in 2009 but withdrew due to the tainted election process.

Afteward, Abdullah created the Coalition for Change and Hope and later the National Coalition of Afghanistan to challenge Karzai’s government.

For one, Abdullah has called out Karzai’s intention of negotiating with the Taliban just plain dumb.

“I should say that Taliban are not fighting in order to be accommodated,” Abdullah told NPR in 2010. “They are fighting in order to bring the state down. So it’s a futile exercise, and it’s just misleading. … There are groups that will fight to the death. Whether we like to talk to them or we don’t like to talk to them, they will continue to fight.”

In 2009, Abdullah caused a stir (chagrin among Islamists and excitement among Afghanistan’s women) when he voted alongside his wife at the polls. He speaks Dari, Pashto, English, Arabic and French.

“For a successful political transition, Afghanistan needs every country involved in its rebuilding effort to send a clear message to today’s Afghan leadership demanding a democratic transition of power based on the principles of free and fair elections,” Abdullah wrote in Foreign Policy in January. “Instead of abandoning democracy because it hasn’t worked under a kleptocracy, Afghanistan and the international community must clean it up.”

Hedayat Amin Arsala, bottom row center, was Karzai’s vice president. Zalmai Rassoul, second from left on the top, is a former foreign minister. Qotbuddin Helal, bottom right, is a high-ranking member of the Taliban-allied insurgent group Hizb-e-Islami Afghanistan. Qayoum Karzai, bottom left, is Hamid’s older brother. Gul Agha Sherzoi, top row right, is the former governor of Nangarhar Province. Sardar Nader Naeem, second from left on the bottom row, is King Zahir Shah’s grandson.

Rounding out the crop is another intriguing possibility, Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, top left.

The former chancellor of Kabul University worked at the World Bank and served as finance minister from 2002-04; his reputation before declining another stint in the cabinet was that he couldn’t be bribed. After the Taliban took over he taught at UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins. After the fall of the Taliban, he returned to his home after 24 years away and became chief adviser to Karzai, receiving wide coverage in international media. After resigning from the cabinet, he reinvigorated educational programs for both men and women at Kabul University.

Ghani ran against Karzai in 2009 yet finished fourth; he hired James Carville as a campaign consultant then. He’s for women’s rights but also supports negotiating with the Taliban if the terrorists agree to a ceasefire first.

Perhaps one of the most remarkable things about Ghani is his wife, Rula, whom he met while attending the American University of Beirut during the late 1970s. “For her public presence and stylish European dress, Rula Ghani stands out as the most Westernized woman among the Kabuli elite,” notes one Afghan observer. And, as a bio of Ghani’s U.S.-born son Tarek notes, Rula is a Lebanese Christian.

By Presi Mandari / AFP, BANDUNG, Indonesia





From a painting hung high on a blood-red wall, Adolf Hitler peers down on young students eating schnitzel and slurping German beer in the Soldatenkaffee (“The Soldiers’ Cafe”), Indonesia’s Nazi-themed cafe.

The coffeeshop opened its doors in the western Javanese city of Bandung in 2011, named after the popular hangout for soldiers in Germany and occupied Paris during World War II.

Eerier than the gas mask canisters and battle flags bearing swastikas is the more than two years’ silence that has followed the cafe’s grand launch.

When the cafe opened no one voiced offense at the waiters and guests dressed as Nazi soldiers — the Holocaust is weak on the radar in Indonesia, home to the world’s biggest Muslim population, where the Jewish community numbers a mere 20 people.

Yet a recent report about the Soldatenkaffee in the English-language Jakarta Globe newspaper triggered angry responses online and prompted Bandung Deputy Mayor Ayi Vivananda to summon the owner for a meeting.

“We need to ask him first in detail what his real intentions are, but what is clear is that Bandung City will not allow anyone here inciting racial hatred,” he said on Thursday.

Henry Mulyana, the cafe’s creator and owner, said he did not intend to bring back memories of the Holocaust, but was not surprised to be branded a “bad guy.”

“I don’t idolize Hitler, I simply adore the soldiers’ paraphernalia,” Mulyana, a Christian who likes playing with air rifles, told reporters at the cafe on Tuesday.

His collection is on display for diners and includes a water canteen, bayonet, goggles and a lantern, most bought online.

“The ones with swastikas on them are worth more,” he said.

The restaurant had only ever received positive press before the recent exposure in English-language media and receives a regular stream of customers.

“We’re living in Indonesia and Indonesians weren’t tortured in the Holocaust, so we don’t really care,” mining company employee Arya Setya said as he ate spaghetti at the cafe with his girlfriend.

Yet now that news of the cafe’s existence has reached a wider audience, it has sparked outrage among Jewish communities in other parts of the world.

“The Simon Wiesenthal Center is reaching out to senior Indonesian diplomats to express on behalf of our 400,000 members and victims of the Nazi Holocaust our outrage and disgust,” Rabbi Abraham Cooper from the US based Jewish human rights group told reporters by e-mail.

Under Indonesian law, anyone who deliberately shows hatred toward others based on race or ethnicity can be jailed for up to five years.

Mulyana said that his cafe has also attracted Western guests, including Germans, with one photographed on its Facebook page wearing a red swastika T-shirt along with several Indonesians in the same clothes.

He revealed he plans to set up an even bigger cafe on the resort island of Bali, which attracts throngs of tourists each year.

“I’ll certainly display Hitler’s image, as well as Winston Churchill’s and paraphernalia from American and Japanese soldiers from World War II,” he said.

His cafe could not contrast more deeply with attitudes in Europe, where several countries have criminalized the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial.

While Mulyana does not deny the Holocaust happened, he said making the tragedy taboo was hypocritical.

“If we want to speak up about humanity, why don’t they stop wars in this world now, like in Afghanistan? War always claims so many lives,” he said.

However, when contacted by reporters yesterday Mulyana said he had decided to close down the cafe temporarily, refusing to give further details.

Historian Asvi Warman Adam from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences blames Indonesia’s education system for a lack of awareness about the Holocaust.

“We don’t hear a lot of criticism against the Nazis and fascism in Indonesia,” Adam said. “Hitler’s book Mein Kampf is banned in many countries, but it’s freely distributed here.”

Islamic hardliners are unlikely to make any noise about the cafe, “but if a Jewish-themed cafe opened, they would most likely stage a protest,” Adam said.",Q1
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/afghan-forces,"Afghan forces suffering too many casualties, says top Nato commander","Afghanistan's police and army are losing too many men in battle, and may need up to five more years of western support before they can fight independently, the top US and Nato commander in the country has told the Guardian.

General Joseph Dunford also said in an interview that it was too early to judge whether Nato had been right to end combat operations in Afghanistan this spring. Western forces have officially offered only training and support to the Afghan army and police during the brutal fighting season of the summer months.

Dunford admitted that Nato and Afghan commanders are concerned about Afghan casualty rates, which have regularly topped more than 100 dead a week. ""I view it as serious, and so do all the commanders,"" Dunford said. ""I'm not assuming that those casualties are sustainable.""

The rapidly expanded security forces, now 350,000 strong, did not need help in basic battle skills, Dunford told the Guardian. But they still struggle to support themselves in areas varying from logistics and planning to intelligence-gathering and back-up from planes and helicopters in difficult battles.

The west officially stopped fighting in Afghanistan in June, shifting to a ""train, advise, assist"" role. Asked whether he thought that transfer was premature, given the problems that Afghan forces face, Dunford said it was too early to judge. ""I think time is going to tell – I don't think you can tell that today.""

Dunford's comments highlighted an apparent rift between western politicians keen to wrap up a messy war that has cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars, and military commanders on the ground who are seeing a newly formed police force and army struggling against a hardened insurgency.

Barack Obama has made it clear that he does not want American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan after 2014, when all Nato combat troops are due to leave. ""By the end of next year – in just 17 months – the transition will be complete. Afghans will take full responsibility for their security and our war in Afghanistan will be over,"" Obama told Marines at their Camp Pendleton base last month. A follow-up Nato training mission, Resolute Support, has been promised, but with a lower profile and far fewer soldiers than the nearly 90,000 still scattered around Afghanistan.

There is no firm end-date for the assistance however, and Dunford said western troops may need to stay in the country until as late as 2018 to tackle problems from the air force to intelligence.

""I look at Afghan security forces development as really kind of three to five years,"" Dunford said. ""That doesn't mean they can't do things today; I'm just talking about before they get to the standard where they may not need assistance and support any more.""

Dunford also did not rule out a combat role for Nato troops after 2014, particularly in the form of close air support – the planes and helicopters that aid troops caught in fierce fighting, which is a capacity that Afghanistan is only starting to develop.

""There are three words in the mission: train, advise and assist. In a Nato context 'assist' would include things like providing combat support, which is specifically the aviation piece, and a policy decision would have to be made about that,"" he said.""

The planned Nato mission, however, will founder without backing from the US, currently negotiating a long-term security deal with Kabul to pave the way for wider western co-operation.

The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has said he is in no hurry and an agreement could take months. But Washington has set an informal October deadline and warned that if no pact is signed there is a ""zero option"" to send all US troops home. Along with the total departure of western military power, that would be likely to bring dramatic cuts in promised funds for police and army salaries, and given the fragile state of both the economy and the security forces, could pave the way for all-out civil war. Dunford said he was confident there would be a western mission, but the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) needed to be signed within months to reassure both Afghans and their neighbours of US commitment to the country.

""We'll have forces here post-2015,"" he said. ""In my mind the BSA is about addressing the environment of uncertainty here in Afghanistan, the fear that people have about 2015 and beyond.""

Despite the shortfalls in police and army abilities, heavy security force casualties and a leap of about a quarter in civilian deaths and injuries in the first half of 2013, Dunford said the troops had defied the Taliban, who had started the summer aiming to crush the government's spirit and will. ""The Afghans actually have been resilient,"" he said. ""They have prevented the Taliban from accomplishing their goals. If you look at where the violence is occurring, 80% of the population is secured from violence.

""I still believe that we will be able to look back in October … and look at this fighting season as an important fighting season and a foundation for the Afghan forces moving forward.""

Progress has come at a heavy cost in lives. The Afghan defence ministry no longer publishes monthly death tolls because of concerns about morale, and the interior ministry said on Monday that 1,792 police officers had been killed since March, Reuters reported. That was equivalent to losses in the 12 preceding months, so in effect a doubling of the death toll.

However, Dunford said Afghan and Nato commanders were determined to make sure next year's battles were less bloody for government forces by focusing on better leadership, planning, equipment and training. ""There is a wide range of causes – it's not just enemy activity,"" he said of the high death rate. ""Some of it reflects a very busy summer, but some of it also reflects a force that is still developing capability.""

The country's leaders were also doing more to show families of the dead and injured that their sacrifices were valued, he said. Other senior western commanders had warned that the security forces needed to feel stronger backing from the people they were risking their lives to defend.

""They are now as gripped with casualties as we are,"" Dunford said. ""What I have seen increasingly is Afghan leaders actually having the same appreciation we have for a need to take care of their people and the families of the fallen.""",Q1

Iran Press TV

Tue Sep 10, 2013 4:8PM GMT

Separate militant attacks have claimed the lives of at least nine Afghan army soldiers in different regions of the war-ravaged country, Afghan Defense Ministry says.

The Defense Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that the soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in Ghazni and the southern Helmand Province.

The number of attacks on Afghan forces is rapidly rising across the violence-wracked country.

Fatalities among Afghan security forces have sharply risen in recent months. Latest figures show more than 900 Afghan troops have been killed since the beginning of the year.

Despite the Afghan government's operations against Taliban militants and associated groups, they have still been able to spread their influence in various regions of the war-torn country.

There has been no letup in the Taliban attacks on US-led foreign troops across Afghanistan.

US-led troops and Afghan forces hence are falling prey to Taliban attacks on an almost daily basis.

In late April, the Taliban announced the start of their annual 'spring offensive' against US-led and Afghan forces, vowing a new wave of attacks across Afghanistan.

The militant group said it would use 'every possible tactic' to inflict casualties on Afghan and US-led forces. They specifically mentioned insider and bomb attacks.

The announcement prompted Afghan authorities to beef up security in major cities across the country, including the capital city of Kabul.

The United States and its allies invaded Afghanistan as part of Washington's so-called war on terror. The offensive removed the Taliban from power, but the country is still gripped by insecurity.

The United States and Afghanistan have reportedly moved closer to a bilateral agreement that spells out the presence of American forces in the country after 2014.

USA Today reports the two sides have ""resolved most issues"" and that the agreement will allow for ""a limited U.S. counterterrorism force and military advisers.""

""We're at the point now where we concluded the text,"" a senior State Department official familiar with the negotiations said on condition of anonymity. ""We're in a period of endgame.""

Most American forces are set to leave Afghanistan in 2014, nearly 13 years after the start of the war. Washington and Kabul signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement last year, stipulating the principles that would guide relations between both countries after 2014. However, both countries have clashed over the details of the agreement that were left to work out.

According to the USA Today report, Afghan leaders have now agreed to allow the U.S. to ""maintain legal jurisdiction over its troops in Afghanistan,"" a sticking point Washington previously said is non-negotiable.

The agreement reportedly also states that American troops will be tasked with assisting Afghan forces and building a counterterrorism force to fight al-Qaeda and related groups.

Even so, it is unclear whether the final agreement receive approval by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, whose relationship with Washington has become increasingly tense. The USA Today report explains the State Department could not make such guarantees in the present agreement, but has been working with Afghan officials to quell any possible objections.

Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters earlier this month that he believed Karzai and the U.S. would be able to come to an agreement before October 2013.

“I can tell you with great candor and integrity that the conversation today with the president was very positive, and I left convinced that he is as committed as we are to moving ahead with this bilateral security agreement as soon as possible,” Dempsey said in the wake of a meeting with Karzai, according to the Department of Defense.

Washington has not announced yet announced how many troops it plans to keep in the country.

On Monday, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr, the current commander of the International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces Afghanistan, told The New York Times that while ""the actual fighting on a day-to-day basis will all be done by Afghans"" after 2014, he believed U.S. forces will remain a necessary component for the country's stability.

http://www.wral.com/fort-bragg-soldier-accused-of-murder-fighting-for-freedom/12715243/,Fort Bragg soldier accused of murder fighting for freedom,"FORT BRAGG, N.C. — A Fort Bragg soldier could spend the rest of his life in a military prison if a jury finds him guilty of illegally ordering fire on three Afghan men on motorcycles during a military mission more than a year ago in Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

Ret. Lt. Col. Guy Womack, a former Marine and defense attorney for 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, however, maintains that the orders were justified because of intelligence information and a Taliban attack in the area the day before the July 2, 2012, shootings, in which two of the Afghan men were killed and a third possibly injured.

A decision not to give the orders, Lorance's mother, Anna Lorance, of Celeste, Texas, says, might have been fatal for the 28-year-old lieutenant, and his platoon of 16 U.S. infantrymen and five Afghan National Army soldiers.

""They were fixing to be ambushed,"" she said. ""It doesn't make sense.""

First Lt. Lorance, with Fort Bragg's 82nd Airborne Division's 4th Brigade Combat Team, faces two counts of murder, a charge of attempted murder and several other charges including wrongfully impeding the investigation and wrongfully soliciting another service member to make a false official statement.

His court-martial at Fort Bragg is set to begin Tuesday and is estimated to last about three days.

NO TITLE PROVIDED

Womack, a Houston-based attorney and former military judge, says that, based on the information he had at the time, his client, a decorated soldier with no history of disciplinary actions in the military, had an obligation to defend his troops.

""It's an extreme example of political second-guessing a young lieutenant who has been in command of a platoon in a combat outpost for just over 24 hours and makes a judgment call based on intelligence reports and a helicopter flying above him at the time,"" Womack said.

The 82nd Airborne Division won't comment on the case, but spokeswoman Lt. Col. Virginia McCabe says that all civilian deaths are thoroughly investigated and that, when warranted, charges are issued.

""We take every allegation seriously and seek appropriate justice, in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice,"" McCabe said. ""This Command has a legal and moral obligation to investigate all civilian-casualty incidents potentially involving military operations.""

But, to his knowledge, Womack says the Army has never been able to definitively determine if the Afghan men killed that day were civilians.

""They called it murder. That's absurd. I think (the Army was) trying to appease the Afghan government,"" Womack said. ""It doesn't make sense. It's bizarre. I've never heard of anything like this.""

Meanwhile, Lorance's battle back at Fort Bragg isn't something he's going at alone.

He's being supported by thousands of people on social media and in paper and online petitions calling for the charges to be dropped. A website, Defend Our Soldier , aims to raise awareness of his case and to raise money for his legal defense.

""I know my son, and I know what he did was the very best thing he knew to do in a split second,"" Anna Lorance said. ""Just knowing him and seeing him all his life, so much pride, and see somebody knock him down at this point is just heartbreaking. It's unacceptable. We don't understand.""

Growing up in Merritt, Texas, the third of four children, 1st Lt. Lorance always wanted to help and defend others, his mother says.

As a teenager, he was actively involved in a police explorer program, and it was then that a police officer encouraged him to consider joining the military. On his 18th birthday, he was in a recruiter's office, joining the Army as a military police officer.

He then spent two years in Korea and 15 months in Iraq before eventually enrolling at the University of North Texas, where he also trained to become a commissioned officer. He graduated in 2010, becoming the first member of his family to go to college.

He was deployed to Afghanistan in March 2012 and was there for about four months when he was tasked to take over a platoon that had lost their lieutenant to a roadside bomb.

It was less than two days in his new role that 1st Lt. Lorance ordered the attack that now has him fighting to keep his freedom.

Since he was charged in January, Womack says his client has remained on administrative duty, going to work every day and participating in military events.

""I'm totally blown away, but I see him, still, with all this happening to him, that he remains positive and sure about what he had to do,"" Anna Lorance said. ""He tries to stay strong, but, as a mother, when I look into his eyes, it's heartbreaking to me because I have always seen so much courage and strength. Now, I see pain and devastation.""

Once his first love, Anna Lorance says, her son no longer wants to serve in the military.

""He's pretty much feels like, 'I put 100 percent into being the very best that I can be for our country and to serve our country, and if this can happen to me and they can push me aside, then I want out,'"" she said.",Q1

Dominick Jones, 24, was welcomed back at the Knights of Columbus in Washington Township after serving his second tour in Afghanistan last year, his second in the country and his third total for the military.

It was an emotional day for Jones, with friends, family and veterans alike giving him an emphatic homecoming celebration.

âThe ultimate sacrifice that all of you gave this country ... is due the respect of all of us,â said Washington Township Mayor Barbara Wallace to Jones and his family.

Jones served as a member of the National Guardâs Military Police for the past 5 years. His most recent tour in Afghanistan ended this past year and was able to return to New Jersey, receiving an escort from McGwire Air Force Base by New Jersey State Police.

Jones has been devoted to the military ever since signing up for the Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps when he was in high school.

He said he got his influence from his father, who served as a member of the Army infantry for 13 years and exposed Jones to army culture through movies like ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""

Although, Robin admits âout of all four of my kids, I didnât expect it to be him,â noting that Jones was a quiet kid growing up compared to his brothers.

âJust look at him. Heâs a big teddy bear,â added Robin.

But Jones knew after going through the Army Junior ROTC program that he was ultimately going to be serving his country one way or another.

âI didnât know what I was going to do (after high school), but I knew it was going to be something in the military,â said Jones.

Jones, who originally served as a detention center guard at a Baghdad prison, has been honored with a number of awards for his military service, including the Army Achievement Medal for his work with the Military Police.

He attributed his success to his relationship with his family, specifically, the relationship he developed with his father and his previous military service.

âItâs great to have a support system where there are people who can say âI know what youâre going through,ââ said Jones.

The trip comes as the Afghan leader continues to delay signing a security agreement with the United States.



Five visits in three years. India’s foreign ministry last week was quick to point to the frequency of Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s trips to India as signifying the “intensity of the relationship.”



And after talks with Indian leaders Friday, Karzai was also keen to note the strength of bilateral ties between the two longtime allies, using much of the standard language used in the past.



""We discussed with the government of India, with honorable Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, wide ranging issues of concern to both countries,"" Karzai stated. ""Also including those discussions were bilateral cooperation between the two countries, on security and defense issues and certainly India had a positive attitude.”



President Karzai arrived in New Delhi on his 13th visit to the country with requests for military equipment and India’s continued support as Afghanistan prepares for the withdrawal of all international combat troops by the end of 2014.



India has provided more than $2 billion in aid towards Afghanistan’s reconstruction and is providing military training to Afghan troops. But analyst Abhijit Iyer-Mitra with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation said India can do much more - including providing Afghanistan with military subsidies if it can get over its fear of Pakistani backlash.



“It looks very ungracious. You have got a guest who keeps coming to you, keeps giving you a lot of importance, and you give him something like just three helicopters and provide him with “moral support” in his BSA [Bilateral Security Agreement] with America. It doesn’t look good. Optically it doesn’t look good.” said Iyer-Mitra.



The Bilateral Security Agreement with the United States, and President Karzai’s refusal to sign it, was also a topic during the Afghan leader’s visit. Karzai said U.S. troops must first stop what he called attacks on Afghan homes and publicly begin peace talks with the Taliban.



Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin told reporters Friday the BSA was discussed during Karzai’s talks with Prime Minister Singh because the two countries’ destinies are “intertwined.” “Both India and Afghanistan see the BSA as important for the stability of Afghanistan. As you are aware, our approach to Afghanistan has always been one of not being prescriptive, not being intrusive and not being judgmental,” he said.



During a speech in the western Indian city of Pune, Karzai reassured Indian business leaders that the United States “will fulfill our conditions” and that the BSA will be signed, while also ensuring profits for those who invest in Afghanistan.



Analyst Abhijit Iyer-Mitra said the Afghan leader will eventually sign the deal, but that either way India should take a more proactive stance in the region - and not outsource its interests to the United States.



“Basically what India is saying is ‘you Indian businessmen have to rely on America for your security. We are not going to provide you with security.’ And what we are telling the Afghans is ‘don’t try to play us off against the Americans in your BSA negotiations. We do not want to enter that game.’ Then the message that Afghanistan takes back is that India is throwing us to the wolves, India is throwing us to Pakistan,” said Iyer-Mitra.



As Afghanistan undergoes this transition, it is clear security is a concern for all three nations, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. During talks with Karzai, Prime Minister Singh thanked Afghan forces for thwarting an August suicide attack against the Indian consulate in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad - noting how terrorism and extremism threaten the entire region.",Q1
"http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-22608-84pc-of-Pakistani-Muslims-want-Sharia,-says-PEW-survey",Coronavirus: Veterans Cricket WC comes to abrupt cancellation,"KARACHI: Coronavirus has brought about the abrupt cancellation of the Veterans (Over-50s) Veterans Cricket World Cup Tournament 2020 which was being staged in and around Cape Town, South Africa.

According to the information made available by the Pakistan Veterans Cricket Association (PVCA), the organising committee and World Cup ambassador, Barry Richards, a former South African batting great, took the decision during the course of the third round of matches, which were then abandoned after the first innings, on Sunday.

Sparkling centuries by opener Sajid Ali (124 off 140 balls) and Muhammad Javed (133 off 84 balls) had put Pakistan in a commanding position as they posted a mammoth score of 321 for two in the allotted 45 overs against Wales. But the match was called off before Pakistan could take the field to defend the huge total.

The first innings in other five matches had also been completed at which point it was decided to stop them following the decision taken by the organizing committee and the tournament was declared cancelled with immediate effect because of the Covid-19 virus.

Canada were taking on West Indies, England was taking on Namibia, Sri Lanka was confronting Australia, Zimbabwe was playing New Zealand and South Africa was tackling India at a time when Pakistan was pitted against Wales. ""The decision was taken for the protection of the players, given their age demographic but also for the local population given that 95% of known cases in South African have come from travellers. It is a public health risk decision,"" the head of the tournament's medical committee, Dr Parag Pandya, announced. ""The decision was taken by the organising and medical committees but it is fully endorsed by the sponsors. There was a great desire to continue but, in the end, it became apparent that cancellation was the right thing to do,"" Evergreen Lifestyle’s spokesperson Arthur Case added. Seven of the 11 visiting teams had been staying in the same Cape Town hotel where appropriate precautions were taken and they were to remain the same until arrangements were made for their repatriation. Pakistan, who finished runners-up in the inaugural tournament a couple of years ago in Australia, was unbeaten in the tournament, having overpowered Namibia and India in their earlier games and they were strongly placed to roll over Wales as well.

The 15-member Pakistan squad was due to take on South Africa and England in their remaining games before the knockout rounds.",Q1

SUBJECT: AFGHAN MOMENTUM ON REINTEGRATION PLANNING

REF: SECSTATE 815

Classified By: AMBASSADOR KARL EIKENBERRY FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) & (d)

SUMMARY

-------

1. (S/Rel UK) At President Karzai,s direction, the Afghan Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) has taken on the task of interagency coordination of reintegration planning, forming an Interagency Policy Working Group (IPWG) which produced a draft &National Reconciliation Policy and Reintegration of Armed Opposition Groups8. The draft ) essentially a statement of reintegration principles which crosses no U.S. redlines ) recommends an appointed cabinet-level lead, a single office to oversee all reintegration/reconciliation efforts and a peace &jirga8 (grand council) to sanction an implementation plan for Karzai,s approval. Deputy National Security Advisor Shaida Abdali presented the draft paper to deputy ministers January 9. Previously, Presidential Advisor Masoom Stanekzai, the once and possibly future GIRoA lead on reintegration, on January 5 produced a concept paper derived from the draft ONSC principles paper, which fills in broad implementation details. (Note: as of January 10, it appears Stanekzai may gain a ministerial post unrelated to reintegration.)

2. (S/Rel UK) GIRoA will present Stanekzai,s reintegration concept paper to the international community at the January 13 Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) security sub-committee meeting and for endorsement at the full JCMB meeting on January 20. We expect that participants will acknowledge the paper at the January 28 London Foreign Ministerial on Afghanistan. While this process indicates Afghan movement on and commitment to developing a reintegration policy, none of these documents has yet been officially adopted and GIRoA has yet to designate a clear reintegration lead. In a January 6 meeting, Deputy Ambassador Ricciardone and ISAF Reintegration Advisor Graeme Lamb reiterated to Stanekzai that GIRoA should outline its integration strategy to the Afghan public prior to London, so that the international community can be seen as responding to an Afghan initiative (including with promises of financial support) rather than driving it. President Karzai told CODEL McCain and Ambassador Eikenberry on January 6 that he would announce a reintegration policy framework prior to London. END SUMMARY

Progress on Papers, But Not a Complete Policy

---------------------------------------------

3. (S/Rel UK) At President Karzai,s direction, the Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) has taken on the task of interagency coordination of reintegration planning, forming an Interagency Policy Working Group (IPWG) which produced a draft &National Reconciliation Policy and Reintegration of Armed Oppositions8 (sic). The draft ) essentially a statement of reintegration principles which crosses no U.S. redlines ) recommends an appointed cabinet-level lead, a single office to oversee all reintegration/reconciliation efforts and a peace jirga (grand council) to sanction an implementation plan for Karzai,s approval. The ONSC paper is a statement of principles with an accompanying assessment of prospects for reintegration,s success and a list of reasons why past efforts have failed. It emphasizes the need for Afghan leadership over programs resourced by ISAF. It leaves the door open to insurgents joining the security forces, though it specifies that GIRoA will not create autonomous militias.

4. (S/Rel UK) Presidential Advisor Masoom Stanekzai, the once and possibly future designated GIRoA lead on reintegration, on January 5 produced a concept paper derived from the draft ONSC principles paper, which fills in broad implementation details. (Note: as of January 10, it appears Stanekzai may gain a ministerial post unrelated to reintegration, throwing into question the identity of the next reintegration lead.) Stanekzai,s paper builds on the ONSC paper, laying out basic criteria for communities, inclusion in a reintegration program by which they would receive development support. (Participating communities would accept the return of reintegrees and supervise their progress.) It stresses the need for education and vocational training for ex-fighters and their economic reintegration within their communities. It cites, without elaboration, &links8 to &public protection force initiatives8, and the National Solidarity Program (a GIRoA initiative which provides grants to communities to fund development projects selected by locally elected development councils), which is one possible source of development support for this program. The paper also lays out general timelines and roles for GIRoA and the international community to follow. It distinguishes between different tiers of insurgents and argues, again

KABUL 00000104 002 OF 003

without elaborating, that different packages and approaches will be necessary for each. Both papers recommend that GIRoA establish a single office with a cabinet-equivalent lead with full authority for reintegration and reconciliation efforts under the direct supervision of the President. ISAF's Force Reintegration Cell (F-RIC) recommended to the ONSC that this lead be staffed by a full-time organization supported by ISAF, the UN and the international community. GIRoA will also create an Afghan and international supervisory commission for financial oversight. (Note: we are emailing both ONSC and Stanekzai papers to SCA/A and S/SRAP.)

TIMELINES...

------------

5. (S/Rel UK) ONSC officials told us on January 4 (and Stanekzai confirmed to us January 6) that they will present Stanekzai,s paper for discussion at the January 13 JCMB security sub-committee meeting and for endorsement at the full JCMB meeting on January 20. President Karzai also told Ambassador Eikenberry and CODEL McCain on January 6 that he would announce a reintegration policy framework prior to the London Conference. ONSC expects to develop more detailed implementation plans and see a Presidential decision on a reintegration lead after the London conference.

6. (S/Rel UK) GIRoA may convene a peace jirga to discuss and ratify the implementation plans, although probably not until May. GIRoA would seek donor pledges at the Kabul conference, which will likely be held in April or May. Both drafts state that the reintegration program will run for four to five years. The Stanekzai paper notes that tactical reintegration will precede higher-level &political engagement8 (reconciliation), and an evaluation phase where GIRoA will assess its progress.

...AND REDLINES

---------------

7. (C/Rel UK) Both documents respect U.S. &red lines8 on insurgent reintegration (insurgents must lay down arms and renounce violence, reject al Qaeda, and abide by the Afghan Constitution) but there are some passages that we will suggest ONSC amend prior to release. Both drafts, but especially Stanekzai,s, seem so focused on reconciling insurgents that they ignore the rights of victims, and largely ignore the issue of perverse incentives. A vague reference to ""amnesty"" for former insurgents in the Stanekzai paper is confusing. (The ONSC paper states that criminals are not eligible for benefits and insurgents not immune from prosecution for violations of human rights.)

8. (/Rel UK) On January 6 Deputy Ambassador Ricciardone and ISAF Reintegration Advisor Graeme Lamb called on Stanekzai at his request for a stock-taking session. Key takeaways:

--All reiterated the importance of ensuring that the international community sticks to its collectively stated intention of supporting an Afghan-led reintegration process.

--Stanekzai detailed ongoing GIRoA discussions over how best to structure a trust fund for handling funds earmarked for reintegration programs. D/AMB noted that the USG would not wish to work its contributions via UNDP, one scenario under consideration. (Note: on January 9 UK emboffs shared with us a proposal for a &dual window8 method, through which donors could choose to have their contributions handled either by UNDP or a commercial bank. We expect this to be a topic for discussion among SRAPs at Abu Dhabi.)

--D/AMB took the opportunity to update Stanekzai on the internal USG processes related to the release of CERP and USAID funding for reintegration, including the requirement that the Secretary certify that GIRoA had a workable plan and that the Department had consulted with GIRoA on it. Stanekzai evinced confidence that the ongoing, extensive GIRoA interagency discussions would result in broad acceptance of the plan, with the looming London conference serving a &forcing function8 to get interested ministries to move beyond &personality issues8 to commit.

--D/AMB and LtGen (ret'd) Graeme Lamb recommended that the Karzai administration publicly outline its reintegration strategy prior to the London conference, which would then serve as a venue for the international community to offer concrete support. Stanekzai agreed and said that he had discussed this two days earlier with President Karzai, who planned to make such an announcement in Kabul.

--Stanekzai cautioned that reintegration of potentially tens of thousands of &foot soldiers8 would be a long-term proposition ) a five year-plan. Much work needed to carried

KABUL 00000104 003 OF 003

out, including development of a communications strategy, engagement with clerical leaders, and a plan for engagement with the Government of Pakistan. Stanekzai was eager to apply lessons learned from reintegration experience in other countries, such as Colombia, Thailand, and the Philippines.

9. (S/Rel UK) COMMENT: ONSC is delivering the long-awaited &Afghan lead8 on reintegration, though on timelines that some international supporters will find frustrating. We believe that the time GIRoA puts into building interagency coordination and consensus before moving out on reintegration is time well spent, particularly given the ongoing cabinet rebuilding effort. We will work with GIRoA and ISAF to encourage some fine-tuning of the papers (e.g. deleting gratuitous swipes at Pakistani ISI support for insurgents and purported ISAF insensitivity to civilian casualties). Whether or not Stanekzai ) a talented individual and open interlocutor ) remains the lead official on reintegration, we are pleased to see reintegration planning becoming institutionalized across ministry/agency lines. Coupled with ONSC,s engagement on banning ammonium nitrate (septel), its emergent lead on reintegration signals a welcome evolution of Afghanistan,s interagency process.

10. (S/Rel UK) The idea of a peace jirga to ratify GIRoA reintegration planning, if well handled, can be a good source of political support. Credible reintegration efforts require buy-in from non-Pashtuns who might otherwise be suspicious of a Pashtun-only &separate peace.8 Considering the scale of development money being earmarked for reintegration support, we are cognizant of the danger of creating perverse incentives, short-changing individuals and communities that have not fed the insurgency, and the potential for a lack of coordination with other governance and development initiatives targeting the same areas. Moreover, as a post-jirga plan could look considerably different than the GIRoA plan that is submitted to it, we should appropriately caveat our release of funds should a post-jirga plan cross U.S. redlines.

http://nypost.com/2013/12/14/missing-american-was-probing-iranian-money-laundering-lawyer/,Missing American was probing Iranian money laundering: lawyer,"An American with links to the Central Intelligence Agency was investigating suspicions that Iranian government officials were diverting petroleum funds and laundering them through Canada when he went missing in Iran in 2007, a lawyer for his family said on Friday.

Robert Levinson, a private detective and former FBI agent, was investigating allegations of corruption by well-connected people in Iran, lawyer David McGee told Reuters.

McGee, who has been looking into Levinson’s disappearance for six years, said the missing American’s inquiry involved trying to trace money laundered through Iranian exiles living in Toronto. He did not provide further details of the investigation.

Reuters could not immediately verify McGee’s assertions. It was not clear whether Levinson was working for the CIA or a private client at the time of his disappearance.

The Associated Press and The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Levinson was not a private citizen on a business trip to Iran in 2007 as the U.S. government often said but was in fact working for a rogue CIA operation when he disappeared.

Current and former U.S. officials acknowledged to Reuters on Friday that Levinson had a relationship with the CIA as a source at the time he visited Kish Island, a resort in the Gulf, and disappeared.

His arrangement with the CIA’s intelligence division, which is not authorized to handle informants, went against the agency’s protocol, U.S. officials said.

McGee acknowledged details of Levinson’s visit to Iran after the publication of the Associated Press and Washington Post articles.

Iran has said it does not know where Levinson is. A video released in 2011 showing him pleading for help. He did not say who was holding him or where.

McGee said that disclosing further details of what Levinson was doing in Iran when he went missing could increase the risk for him, assuming he is still alive.

“There are benefits and there are risks,” he said. “The negative is additional risk to Bob. The positive is that the family can step up pressure on the United States government” to redouble efforts to find Levinson, McGee said.

Levinson’s family believe that the U.S. government has “not acted to its full capacities” in trying to free him, McGee said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Levinson “was not a U.S. government employee when he made that trip” to Iran.

People familiar with Levinson’s activities said he went to Kish Island to meet with Daoud Salahuddin, a fugitive American also known as David Belfield, who had fled there in 1980. It was not clear whether the attempt to meet Salahuddin related to Levinson’s money-laundering investigation.

Salahuddin was charged with murder in the shooting death of a former spokesman for the Shah-era Iranian Embassy at his suburban Washington home during the hostage-taking of American diplomats in Tehran. Salahuddin spent the following decades pursuing activities ranging from English teaching to fighting with militants in Afghanistan.",Q1

NATO announced the deaths of 10 fighters in the strike, but did not report civilian casualties.

Afghan officials said at least nine civilians were killed in the airstrike and while a provincial police chief said 16 civilians died, including four women and four children.

Kunar province police chief Abdul Habib Sayed Khaili said a drone struck hit a pickup truck carrying women and children after three Arab and three Afghan fighters came on board in Qoro village.

http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/10809/,"‘Article 226 makes it clear that all elections, except for PM and Ms, would be held by secret ballot’","ISLAMABAD (APP): The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday adjourned hearing in a presidential reference seeking opinion on open balloting for the upcoming Senate elections till Thursday.

A five-member larger bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mushir Alam, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi heard the reference.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, while continuing his arguments, said the Constitution did not mention the procedure for the election of NA speaker and deputy speaker and Senate chairman and deputy chairman.

The house officials conducted the elections where the Constitution did not specify the procedure, he said. The outgoing speaker served as returning officer for the election of the next one, he added.

He said the elections whose procedure was stipulated in the Constitution, would be considered under the Constitution.

The Constitution called for the creation of national and provincial assemblies, he added.

Justice Ijaz observed that the court understood the crux of his argument that the Constitution called to form offices and bodies, but the method of their election was in the law not in the Constitution.

The AGP said the offices of national and provincial assemblies were not constituted under the Constitution but under the law. The Constitution provided their composition, but laws and acts had been made for their elections, he added.

He said the duration of the parliament, the modus operandi, the number of sittings, etcetera were stated but the Constitution did not specify the procedure for the elections.

He said only the number of elected representatives was mentioned in the Constitution, but laws and acts were made for their election by the constituents.

The AGP said the number of special seats for women and minority and full composition of the parliament were provided in the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz asked how the elections were held for the women reserved seats.

The AGP replied that women seats were allocated by the winning ratio of the political parties. It was written in the Constitution that the National Assembly (NA) elections were held under the law, he added.

Addressing the AGP, the CJP said according to him (AGP) the NA elections were held by law.

Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan said the Act 2017 called for elections by secret ballot.

The AGP said Article 59 provided the composition of the Senate. The word act was also used for women in the Senate, he added.

He said direct votes and constituencies had been mentioned for the NA but direct elections were not mentioned for the Senate.

Justice Bandial said the formal procedure for the election of NA members was given in the law but not for the Senate.

The AGP said the procedure for Senate elections was different as members of provincial assemblies proposed the candidates for the Senate. Independent candidates could also participate in the Senate elections, he added.

Justice Ijaz said the members of the provincial assemblies should be allowed to exercise their votes freely.

The attorney general said elections of Senate chairman, deputy chairman, prime minister and the chief ministers were not clear in the Election Commission and the Election Act. Article 60 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the Senate chairman, he added.

Justice Ijaz said Articles 53 and 60 of the Constitution did not mention that there would be open ballot elections or secret elections.

The attorney general said the elections of the NA speaker and Senate chairman would be held through secret balloting under the Article 266.

He said it was clear in the Constitution that the outgoing NA speaker would conduct the election of the speaker. The first task of the elected assembly would be the election of the speaker, he added.

He said the elections of the prime minister, NA speaker and Senate chairman were not conducted under the Election Act.

He said the parliament itself conducted the elections of the prime minister, Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.

He said Article 53 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the speaker but Senate and NA elections were not held under the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz said Article 226 made it clear that all elections, except for the prime minister and the chief ministers, would be held by the secret ballot.

The AGP said the chapter on elections held under the law was different.

The Article 226 did not apply to every election, he added.

The chief justice said if Article 226 applied, the elections for reserved seats could not take place.

He said elections for the national and provincial assemblies were held under the law.

The attorney general said all laws were framed in accordance with the Constitution.

He said political parties submit lists for representation on reserved seats.

He said an independent candidate could contest the Senate election if he was nominated and proposed by a member of the provincial assembly.

Justice Ijaz said if any member of the provincial assembly wanted to vote against the party, he should use open balloting.

The attorney general said generally people considered election only on voting day but the election machinery was also part of the voting process. Elections were not just about voting as it had many stages, he added.

He said constituency elections, preparation of voter lists, delimitation, nomination papers, voting schedule, voting and results were all the stages.

The chief justice said those were the stages of direct elections.

The attorney general said whether there was an assembly or not, the president could issue an ordinance related to the elections.

He said the Senate Election Act of 1975 also laid down the procedure for holding Senate elections.

He said elections under the law could not be challenged but only elections held under the statute could be challenged in tribunals.

Justice Ijaz said elections under the law could be challenged under the Constitution.

The attorney general said the vote of an ordinary citizen was free but the vote of a member of provincial assembly (MPA) given to a senator was not free.

When the MPA’s vote for the Senate could not be free, then the ballot could not be secret, he added.

Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan said it was unwise to vote for another senator by secret ballot in violation of party discipline.

The MPA violating party discipline should have moral courage to openly say that he had voted against the party discipline, he added.

Upon this, Justice Bandial said this was moral, not legal. The MPA had the right to vote according to his will, he added.

The chief justice said the courts were the guardians of the Constitution.

Justice Yahya Afridi addressing the AGP said his argument was moral in nature and the matter was political.

He said the question raised in the presidential reference was legal and ethical but the matter was political.

He asked the attorney general that his case was based on ethics while the issue was political.

He asked why the government was seeking the opinion of the court instead of approaching the parliament?

The attorney general said the government had only approached the SC for an opinion.

If the opinion of the SC was in government’s favour, the final decision was to be taken by the parliament, he added.

He said the SC had given its opinion on the NA’s resolution regarding recognizing Bangladesh.

Justice Afridi said the AGP’s argument regarding Bangladesh was correct.

The attorney general said he could give eleven examples of cases in which the court ruled despite the presence of political aspects.

He said the apex court disqualified politicians by interpreting the law in dual citizenship cases.

He said the issue of disclosure of assets of parliamentarians was political but the SC also interpreted the law on it.

The government had come to the SC to stop the sale and purchase of votes and for transparency, he added.

http://www.voanews.com/content/us-senators-press-for-accord-to-keep-some-troops-in-afghanistan/1859941.html,Senators Press to Keep Some US Troops in Afghanistan,"American lawmakers reacted sharply Wednesday to President Barack Obama’s directive to the U.S. military to prepare for the withdrawal of all troops from Afghanistan if no long-term security agreement is finalized with Kabul.



Many legislators would like to see a residual force remain in Afghanistan, for training and other puposes, but some concede that may not be possible.



Obama took action Tuesday to back up what his administration has been saying for months: absent a bilateral security agreement, or BSA, between the U.S. and Afghanistan, all American troops will depart the country by the end of this year.



Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he understood Obama was frustrated by Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s refusal to sign the document.



“The longer we have to wait for a BSA, the harder it is to plan militarily,” he said.



Graham worried that an Afghanistan left to fend for itself would descend into the chaos and violence that has beset Iraq since U.S. forces left that country - a view shared by fellow Republican Senator Johnny Isakson.



“We need to leave a presence in Afghanistan. We made a mistake not leaving one in Iraq. And I hope, whatever the president negotiated, we leave a presence to protect the [U.S.] assets [in Afghanistan], and also to have a deployment if we need it in the future,” he said.



Other lawmakers contend that U.S. troops have already been in Afghanistan too long, and that scarce government resources should be redirected toward domestic needs. As early as 2011, when Obama first announced a drawdown of troops in Afghanistan, independent Senator Bernie Sanders said Afghanistan must take full responsibility for its security. He urged a U.S. withdrawal “at significantly faster speed and greater scope” than the administration’s timeline.



Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said finalizing a BSA with Afghanistan would be in both countries’ best interests. But she added the United States “may not have a choice” except to withdraw if the accord is not finalized. She said President Karzai - or whoever succeeded him after this year’s elections - must understand that Americans have soured on open-ended foreign military commitments.



“The country is war-weary. We have had troops in a war zone for over 10 years now. I think the country wants to bring those servicemen and women home, wants to focus on the challenges we face here at home,” she said.



President Karzai has objected to U.S. military tactics in his country, especially raids on Afghan homes. His spokesman, Faiq Wahidi, repeated the president's demands.



""This agreement must reflect and mean peace to the people of Afghanistan,"" the spokesman says, ""And whenever the Afghan people are convinced that their wish will be met, the agreement will certainly be signed,” he said.



Afghan lawmakers reportedly support the BSA by an overwhelming margin, and many presidential hopefuls preparing for the election, now less than two months away, have said they would sign the accord upon taking office if Karzai failed to do so.



For now, Senator Graham is urging patience, even if that means waiting for a new Afghan president leader to sign the bilateral security agreement. He added, however, “The longer we wait, the more difficult it gets.”",Q1
http://www.strategypage.com/qnd/ethiopi/articles/20130601.aspx,Ethiopia: Dealing With Annoying Neighbors,"The UN has raised the authorized strength (by 1,126 troops, roughly a battalion task force) of the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) peacekeeping operation to 5,326 soldiers. The original authorized figure was 4,200 soldiers, 3,973 are currently in Abyei. A 227-man Ethiopian aviation unit is scheduled to arrive later this summer, which would bring the total to 4,200. The Ethiopian Army provides the combat soldiers for UNISFA and an Ethiopian Army general officer commands the peacekeeping operation. The additional 1,126 soldiers are expected to come from Ethiopia. Sudan and South Sudan both claim Abyei. The region is large, about 10,000 square kilometers, and it has oil reserves. The UN authorized the increase because tribal tensions are rising in the region. On May 4 th Misseriya tribesmen murdered the paramount chief of the Dinka Ngok. The Dinka chief was traveling in a convoy under the protection of UNISFA peacekeepers. The Misseriya are an Arabized, semi-nomadic tribe and are pro-Sudan (northern Sudan, Khartoum government). Until forced to flee during the long civil war, the Dinka Ngok were the dominant tribe in the area. The Dinka Ngok favors South Sudan. Two Ethiopian soldiers were also killed in the May 4th incident. The peacekeepers killed 17 Misseriya gunmen. Several Dinka Ngok organizations have criticized UNISFA’s failure to protect civilians. One group has even called for the withdrawal of the peacekeeping force.

May 31, 2013: An estimated 12,000 South Sudanese fled recent fighting in South Sudan’s Jonglei state and taken refuge in Ethiopia. Another 5,000 have fled to Kenya.

May 30, 2013: A senior International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor said that the Kenyan government must prove to the ICC that Kenyan courts can genuinely prosecute President Uhuru Kenyatta for crimes against humanity. Kenyatta and his chief deputy, William Ruto, are charged with planning and inciting post-election violence in 2007, that killed over 1,200 people. The ICC has indicted the men for crimes against humanity. Kenya has asked that it be permitted to try the men. The ICC is stressing the word “genuine” because ICC prosecutors think Kenya will conduct a sham trial. The ICC can pass jurisdiction to a nation’s courts if the national courts can conduct credible criminal investigations and a credible court room trial.

China has agreed to help finance Ethiopia’s new rail link to Djibouti. China’s Export and Import Bank (EXIM) will provide $2.3 billion in loans to finance the construction of a 756 kilometer electrified railroad line connecting Ethiopia to Djibouti’s port of Doraleh. The line will run from the Ethiopian town of Sebeta, through Meiso, through Dawale, and end at Doraleh. Two Chinese companies will build the rail line and the first segment is already under construction.

May 29, 2013: The East African Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) recently decided to support the Somalia national government’s denial of special autonomy for Jubaland in southern Somalia. However, the local Jubaland administration in Kismayo has taken the position that if Somalia does not give it a special autonomous status it may “cut ties” with the national government in Mogadishu and form a separate Jubaland state. As of May 15th, the Jubaland administration has a president. His official title is president of the Jubaland State of Somalia. The background story here is Kenya. Kenya has been working closely with the tribes in Jubaland. Though the Kenyan government supports Somalia’s national government (Somali Federal Government), it appears that Kenyan security officials believe southern Somalia will be much more stable if granted autonomy.

Critics of Kenya’s intervention are now saying that all along the Kenyan government wanted to carve out an independent buffer state between Somalia and Kenya. The claim that Kenya wants an independent state is a reach. Besides, Ethiopia does not like the idea of an independent state. The claim that Kenya was a buffer zone is no news at all. There is even a name for it: the Jubaland project. The Kenyan government has said that its objective in southern Somalia is to stabilize the area. Kenya wants a peaceful border and that means it wants a stable, reliable neighbor. The Kenyan government wants to stop attacks by Somali Islamist extremists (al Shabaab) in Kenya because the tribes flee across the border into Kenyan refugee camps. The southern Somalis want a high degree of local authority (autonomy). Kenya wants the southern tribes to be able to police their own region, so Kenya wants the tribes to be satisfied with whatever post-Somali war political settlement is agreed to. That is one reason the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF, Kenyan Army) in Somalia have asked the African Union’s AMISOM peacekeeping mission in Somalia to provide a political support unit to help settle disputes between the Jubaland administration and the Somali government in Mogadishu. Jubaland is also referred to as “the Jubba” and Azania. It has three sub-regions, Gedo, Middle Juba, and Lower Juba. Jubaland is basically the area along the Somalia-Kenya border. It includes the port of Kismayo, Somalia south of the Juba River and a slice of the land just north and east of the Juba River. The Juba River flows south from the Ethiopian border; it enters the Indian Ocean near Kismayo. (Austin Bay)

May 27, 2013: Ethiopia announced that the African Union (AU) will create an interim military rapid reaction force. The rapid reaction force would be available to respond to coups, large-scale human rights violations, rebellions, and other crises. At the moment the AU is calling the force the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises force. The interim force will serve until the AU’s African Standby Force becomes operational. South Africa, Uganda, and Ethiopia have agreed to provide military units to serve in the force. This is actually an old idea. Since the 1960s, there have been calls for a pan-African rapid response force. The recent trouble in the Central African Republic (CAR) spurred creation of the interim force

The African Union indicated that it will ask the International Criminal Court (ICC) to let Kenya prosecute the ICC cases against its new president, Uhuru Kenyatta, and his deputy, William Ruto. The ICC has charged both men with crimes against humanity. The crimes were committed in the bloody aftermath of Kenya’s 2007 national election. This year Kenyatta was elected president.

May 26, 2013: Kenyan police reported that Degodia tribal bandits crossed the border from Ethiopia and murdered three members of the Gare tribe near the Kenyan town of Gesireb. Many Gare then sought refuge in Gesireb. At least 25 people have been killed in the last few weeks in tribal clashes between the Degodia and Gare.

May 24, 2013: Eritrea celebrated two decades of independence. On May 24, 1993 Eritrea formally declared independence from Ethiopia. As for 2013, the big news remains the January 2013 take-over of the Information Ministry in Asmara. Eritrean Army soldiers, backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers, took control of the ministry and issued a televised demand for reform in Eritrea.

May 20, 2013: Ethiopia promised Somaliland (separatist Somalia statelet in northern Somalia) that it would help protect Somaliland form attack by Somalia or the al Shabaab Islamic terrorists.

May 18, 2013: The Kenyan government said that instability in Somalia threatens stability throughout the Horn of Africa. Kenya wants the AU to increase the size of its AMISOM peacekeeping force in Somalia.

May 17, 2013: The UN said that the human rights situation in Eritrea is unacceptable and must be closely monitored. The UN accused Eritrea of blatant disrespect for human rights and said the country must undergo fundamental reform. The UN statement followed recent allegations that over 10,000 Eritreans are political prisoners. Many of the prisoners are incarcerated in poorly ventilated underground prison cells and shipping containers. Earlier this year the UN estimated that around 36,000 Eritreans fled the country in 2012.

May 16, 2013: A Degodia tribe militia force crossed the Ethiopia-Kenya border in the Malkamau area and killed three Gare tribe women.

May 14, 2013: An Ethiopian policeman murdered 14 people in the town of Bahirdar (northwestern Ethiopia, near Lake Tana). Security officers chased the murderer and he committed suicide by jumping off a bridge into the Blue Nile River. The government called the incident a massacre. Police said the incident is under investigation and they have not determined the motive for the murder spree.

May 11, 2013: Djibouti and the U.S. have agreed to create bilateral defense structure for coordinating defense and security policies relating to East Africa and the Horn of Africa. This is diplo-speak for coordinating anti-terror policy, anti-piracy policy, and coordinating political and security responses to emerging threats in the region. The US has a US Navy facility in Djibouti. Djibouti is also the headquarters for the US Coalition Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA).

Ethiopian law enforcement officers arrested 12 people in what media described as the country’s most high-profile corruption case in ten years. One of the individuals arrested is a senior government official who is the minister in charge of the revenue and customs authority. His deputy was also arrested. A prominent businessman was among the other 11 arrested.

Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani is nobody’s fool. The Emir of Qatar did not step down in favour of his son Tamim because of his health, although a gastric bypass operation had drastically reduced his weight. So much had his appearance changed – so much fitter and smaller did he look – than when I lunched with him at a Lebanese restaurant in Doha, I at first did not recognise the ruler of Qatar. Was the 60-year-old man opposite me a senior official of the Emir, perhaps? Only the deference paid to him by other guests and the sudden appearance of his second wife Sheikha Moza – mother of the new Emir – alerted me to the fact this was the same man I had met in his palace years before.

He talked to Qataris of his “new role in serving the nation” and the world wondered what “role” this might be. A new “Father of the Nation” perhaps, the title which President Hamid Karzai consigned to the old King of Afghanistan when he returned to Kabul? I doubt it. If Emir Tamim is going to control Qatar, Sheikh Hamad may well control Tamim. Not in the dictatorial sense, of course. But when Sheikh Hamad’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani, retires – as Qataris believe he now will – he will remain in charge of the Qatar Investment Authority, of which 33-year old Tamim is chairman.

The outgoing Emir has not ruled Qatar since 1995 only to go into retirement. Did the idea of mortality strike him after his operation? The “old” Emir (the quotation marks are necessary for a comparatively young man) was used to danger. He once told a palace visitor that he would not tell the US to remove its massive airbase from Qatar – however angry he was with the George W Bush administration – because if he did so, “my Arab brothers will invade me”. Too true. The “retirement” – quotation marks again, perhaps – of Sheikh Hamad is one in the eye to the fragile-boned old men who run Saudi Arabia and whose ancient royalty have a disturbing habit of dying in office.

Tamim, they say, has led a comparatively sheltered life, although Harrow and Sandhurst – the same military boot-camp which his father attended – may persuade the Brits that he is our Plucky Little Emir Mk II. They had better watch out. In Washington, Sheikh Hamad once responded to a complaint about his Al-Jazeera channel from Dick Cheney by walking out of Cheney’s office, thus winning a Guinness Book of Records-style award for the shortest meeting ever with a US Vice-President. And when he believed that Bashar al-Assad had lied to the Turkish Prime Minister about democracy in Syria, Sheikh Hamad turned with fury upon the Assad regime. As he gave weapons to the Libyan rebels, so he now sends money and guns to the Syrian rebels. Never has an owner of Harrods been so involved in gun-running. If it’s like father, like son, Tamim will be no pushover.

But Hamad likes surprises. Who would have expected al-Jazeera to appear on British TV screens? Or Qatar Airways, the only airline where I once sat next to an Arab noble with a hooded eagle on his arm in business class? Or an Emir owning large bits of London? The richest country with the lowest unemployment, Qatar lives on liquid gas, although exporting it – frozen – is a very expensive matter. But is it a “nation” when it has a native population the size of Hull? Certainly it is a more viable state than the gloomy minority monarchy down the coast in Bahrain.

And, like the old British Empire, it has a power grotesquely out of synch with its geographical size. A conduit to the accused war criminal Bashar of Sudan, to Israel, to the sectarian politicians of Lebanon, to Hamas in Gaza, to the Taliban, the nation which Hamad built doesn’t just – as the old cliché goes – “punch above its weight”; it is a flea which happily bites any great power that gets in its way, and woe betide the victim which scratches its skin afterwards.

But Hamad learned the greatest lesson of the Arab awakening: that the great revolutions of the region will one day reach the Gulf – with a tornado force which might embrace a king or two – and when they do, Qatar may survive. Why should Tamim wish to change that happy prospect?",Q1

Pete and Ann Annis have bought it back from new owner for £1,757

Soldier's widow is in a new relationship and has a young daughter

Caroline says soldier's parents have not spoken to her in four years



The parents of a war hero killed in Afghanistan have spoken of their disgust after his widow sold a medal honouring his sacrifice.

Fusilier Simon Annis’s young wife Caroline, 26, listed the Elizabeth Cross on the online noticeboard Gumtree for just £500.

The medal, which recognises the loss borne by Service families, was awarded to her after her 22-year-old husband died in an explosion in Afghanistan.

'Callous': Fusilier Simon Annis' wife Caroline sold his Elizabeth Cross over the internet for £500

'Insulting': Fusilier Annis' morther Ann said she would have re-mortgaged her house to get her son's medal back

But Fusilier Annis’s devastated parents have criticised their daughter-in-law for not offering it to them before selling it.

Pete and Ann Annis have now paid the new owner £1,757 – more than three times the initial listing – to retrieve the medal.

They only found out that the Cross had been put up for sale when a friend spotted an advertisement online.

Mrs Annis, 49, last night branded her daughter-in-law as ‘callous’ and ‘despicable’.

She said: ‘It’s as if my boy’s life meant nothing to her.



‘It was terribly insulting that she didn’t offer us the medal instead of sneakily selling it.’

Fusilier Annis, from Salford, was serving with the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in the feared Helmand Province.

He and his wife had been married for just a few months when he was killed on his six-month tour of duty.

Along with comrade Fusilier Louis Carter, 18, he died on August 16 in 2009, trying to save their severely wounded commander, Lance Corporal Jamie Fullarton, 24.

The soldiers had been advancing into Sangin, a Taliban outpost dubbed the most dangerous place on earth.



During the mission, L/Cpl Fullarton triggered a bomb, badly injuring himself and three others.

Fusiliers Annis and Carter rushed forward to help the wounded.



As they carried their commander away on a stretcher, they set off a second blast – killing them both. L/Cpl Fullarton later died of his wounds.

Paying tribute to her husband following his death Caroline Annis described Simon as the ‘perfect husband, son and brother’.

‘He will be sorely missed by all of us,’ she said at the time.

‘He was a true hero who made all of us so very proud and he will always have a place in our hearts. We will love and miss him always.’

Sacrifice: The Elizabeth Cross was presented to Fusilier Simon Annis' bride Caroline after he was killed in an explosion in Helmand in 2009 (file picture)

But four years after Fusilier Annis’s premature death, his young widow – who had fallen out with the soldier’s family and is now in a new relationship – advertised the Elizabeth Cross on the internet.

It was snapped up by a dealer in Altrincham, who paid £1,200 – £700 above the initial asking price – and then placed it with the London Medal Company, a shop that specialises in selling military memorabilia.

The London Medal Company insists it did not make a profit on the transaction.

Heartbroken Mr and Mrs Annis have said they would have re-mortgaged their house in order to retrieve the award.

When asked about her decision to sell the Elizabeth Cross, Caroline said: ‘It was given to me as next of kin and it was mine to sell.’

By Sabina Idayatova



Georgia has made yet another sacrifice on the challenging path of freedom and joining the civilized world, President Mikheil Saakashvili said June 6 in an address to the nation, commenting on the death of seven Georgian soldiers in Afghanistan.

The Georgian servicemen were killed after a truck bomb hit one of the bases in the Helmand province of Afghanistan on June 6. Nine other soldiers were wounded, but there is no threat to their lives and they were hospitalized.

President Saakashvili declared June 7 the national day of mourning.

""This is a very heavy blow and there is nothing harder to me as president, to see how the Georgian families receive messages about the death of their beloved members,"" Saakashvili said. ""This is a tragedy for them, it's a blow to the country, for each of us. I have been to Afghanistan several times in recent years and three times had an opportunity to meet with our military at the place of duty. They are very proud of the mission they are fulfilling against the daily hazards, displaying bravery.""

This is a very difficult mission and the more it is coming to an end - the withdrawal of the military contingent in 2014 -- the more dangerous it becomes for the Georgian military, Saakashvili said.

""Why we are in Afghanistan -- the question in every Georgian family -- we are there to strengthen our country, because Georgia can be saved only if we become part of strong alliances, become members of the EU and NATO, and if we are to contribute to global security, "" Saakashvili said.

""I have just got a letter from the secretary general of NATO, which pours praise on our actions and our military, extending condolences. They [the killed Georgian soldiers] died for the future of our country and our children,"" the President added.

""It is our obligation before the memory of our fallen soldiers not to give up, not to step back and to continue moving towards the Euro-Atlantic space, to continue our daily struggle for Georgia's independence. I'm sorry for every family of the deceased and all of Georgia and I am sure that their death will not be in vain and we shall ensure our security,"" Saakashvili said.

Georgia has lost 28 servicemen so far during its involvement in the NATO mission in Afghanistan.

The Defense Ministry reported that Minister Irakli Alasania cut short his official visit to Brussels and left for Afghanistan. He familiarized himself with the situation and visited the wounded.

Alasania has also met with Afghan Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi.

Mohammadi expressed condolences over the death of the Georgian soldiers during the suicide attack on the military base. He also thanked his counterpart for the dedication of the Georgian military in the fight against terrorism.

The two ministers discussed the overall situation in Afghanistan and the details of the plans for the future.

Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in the letter addressed to President Saakashvili and Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, offered his condolences to the Georgian people and the families of the victims in Afghanistan.

""Georgia takes a heavy burden in Afghanistan and paid a high price for it. Georgia plays an important role in these efforts, for which we thank you,"" the letter says.

Rasmussen stressed that such terrible incidents will not force NATO to abandon the goal, which is to transfer the responsibility to the Afghan people for the security of their country.

Georgia deems accession to NATO as one of its top foreign policy priorities. Soon after the declaration of independence, Georgia joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Georgia's bilateral relations with NATO were established in 1994 when the country joined the Partnership for Peace program (PfP). At the informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in 2006 it was decided to launch Intensified Dialogue on Membership Issues with the South Caucasus republic.

Georgia as a significant contributor to Euro-Atlantic security is closely involved in NATO-led operations and its contribution to the ISAF operation in Afghanistan is of significant importance. Georgia is currently the second largest troop contributor to Afghanistan among the non-NATO states.",Q1

After the judge earlier this month allowed Hasan, 42, to represent himself, he requested the delay to prepare for his “defense of others” strategy, by which he planned to tell jurors that he shot U.S. troops because they posed an immediate threat to Taliban leaders in Afghanistan. Last week, Osborn said that defense strategy failed as a matter of law.

Two reportedly die after Zyprexa shots

Federal regulators are investigating the deaths of two patients who received injections of a

longer-lasting version of Eli Lilly's antipsychotic drug Zyprexa.

The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the patients died three to four days after receiving an appropriate dose of Zyprexa Relprevv. They had very high levels of olanzapine, a key chemical compound in Zyprexa, in their blood. High levels of olanzapine can lead to cardiac arrest, irregular heartbeats, sedation or comas.

A Lilly spokesman said the drugmaker is studying the issue. An FDA representative said doctors can continue to prescribe the drug as long as they follow the plan for use that comes with it.

http://www.oakridger.com/article/20140213/NEWS/140219879?rssfeed=true,Wine Talk: Three fab bubblies for Valentine’s Day,"Robert Whitley Creators Syndicate

There are a number of adult beverages that might impress as well as endear you to your valentine this week. But few, if any, can match the powerful allure of Champagne or world-class sparkling wine.

The pop of the cork is music to the ears. The sparkle in the glass is a sight for sore eyes. The fizz on the palate is a feast for the senses. Taken altogether, bubbly on Valentine’s Day is a cliche that works.

It is the rare person who won’t be soothed and charmed by a glass or two of elegant bubbly. I have chosen a trio of Valentine’s Day bubblies that have distinguished themselves this year in major international wine competitions.

The first, Domaine Carneros by Taittinger Cuvee de la Pompadour ($36), is a sparkling rose that earned a platinum award from judges at the fifth annual Sommelier Challenge, where wines are evaluated exclusively by certified sommeliers with vast experience. Domaine Carneros is owned by the prominent Taittinger Champagne house, whose exacting standards are beautifully maintained by founding winemaker Eileen Crain.

Cuvee de la Pompadour is, in my humble opinion, the finest rose sparkling wine made in America. It was hardly a surprise that a group of trained sommeliers would choose it as one of their favorite bubblies at the Sommelier Challenge.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

My second recommendation, Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve Champagne ($65), also is a personal favorite. Chef de Cave Regis Camus oversees this venerable Champagne house and maintains the rich style that has made this non-vintage brut one of the best values in Champagne year after year. It delivers toasty notes of brioche and ripe stone fruits, with palate weight that is more aligned with vintage Champagne than a typical non-vintage Champagne.

Camus can pull this off because Charles Heidsieck maintains some of the finest reserve stocks in the Champagne district. At $65, Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve isn’t cheap, but it measures up in blind tastings to Champagne that retails at much higher price points. This bubbly was a platinum-award winner at the 10th annual Critics Challenge in June. You guessed it; the judges making the critical evaluations were all prominent wine critics.

The third and final recommendation, Gloria Ferrer Va de Vi ($22), is a gold-medal winner from the recent Winemaker Challenge, judged exclusively by professional winemakers. Va de Vi is an outstanding California sparkling wine from perhaps that state’s most underrated producer. It is made in the extra dry style, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut (although that would seem counter-intuitive).

That said, this is a beautifully balanced, delicious extra-dry bubbly that would be ideal for those who enjoy their sparkling wine with something slightly sweet. If that person is you, then Va de Vi is your ticket this Valentine’s Day.

Best Value

Wines are rated on a 100-point scale. Wines are chosen for review because they represent outstanding quality or value, and the scores are simply a measure of this reviewer’s enthusiasm for the recommended wine.

Kenwood Vineyards 2011 Merlot, Sonoma County ($14) — This was an iffy vintage in Sonoma County, but that didn’t stop Kenwood from doing what it seems to excel at vintage after vintage: delivering quality and value with its basic Sonoma County line of wines. This merlot shows lovely blueberry fruit and spice, with soft tannins and a lingering finish. For $14 you would be hard pressed to find a tastier “drink now” Merlot. Rating: 88.

Sebastiani 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon, Sonoma County ($19) — Winemaker Mark Lyon is extremely skilled at getting the most out of the grapes nature gave him. This 2011 Sonoma County cab exhibits a core of sweet red fruit with soft tannins and a kiss of oak. The vintage was difficult, but Sebastiani and Lyon made it work, and the result is a delicious California cab for under $20. Rating: 88.

Tasting Notes

Wakefield 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon ‘The Visionary,’ Clare Valley & Eden Valley, Australia ($120) — Clare Valley is among the finest terroirs for cabernet sauvignon in all of South Australia, and this gem of a cab from Wakefield drives home that point. Beautifully layered and complex, this powerful example of Clare cab shows ripe blackberry and cassis fruit, aromas of mocha and coffee and a backnote of eucalyptus. It’s a stunning wine now, but destined to improve for those with the patience and discipline to cellar it another eight to 10 years. Rating: 96.

J. Lohr 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon ‘Hilltop,’ Paso Robles ($35) — J. Lohr can hang with the best of them when it’s hitting on all cylinders, as it does with this 2010 Hilltop Cabernet. It’s everything anyone could want in a Paso cab, delivering layers of black-fruited aroma, sweet tannins and vanillin spice. This vintage is voluptuous yet structured and while it might improve over the next several years if cellared, it is beautiful at the moment. This may well be the finest $35 cabernet sauvignon in America. Rating: 94.

J Vineyards 2012 Pinot Noir ‘Misterra,’ Russian River Valley ($50) — J’s Misterra is a pinot noir with a twist, made with the unusual addition of pinotage (native to South Africa) and pinot meunier, a red grape variety typically used in the production of sparkling wine. Winemaker Melissa Stackhouse has crafted a beautifully balanced, delicious red from this unique blend. It can legally be classified pinot noir because that grape accounts for 90 percent of the blend. It exhibits a spicy nose that follows through on the palate. On the palate, it delivers complex layers of red and blue fruit, with slightly chewy tannins. This is the first vintage of Misterra, and it shows the potential and promise of this daring combination of grapes. Rating: 93.

Duckhorn Vineyards 2010 Merlot, Carneros ($70) — This excellent Carneros appellation Merlot is yet another example of what Duckhorn can achieve with this often-maligned grape variety. Merlot is the Rodney Dangerfield of Napa Valley red wines, yet in the right hands it is as magnificent as king cabernet, and sometimes better. Duckhorn has been a Merlot specialist since its inception and treats the grape variety with all of the dignity and care most Napa vintners accord cabernet. This vintage from the cool Carneros district is restrained as Napa Valley reds go, exhibiting layers of blueberry and currant fruit, exquisite balance and a subtle spice note on the finish. Though enjoyable now, it promises to be even more dazzling with an additional five to seven years of cellar age. Rating: 93.

by Kent Klein February 04, 2014

Reports that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been holding secret peace talks with Taliban officials led to high-level meetings in Washington Tuesday. U.S. officials are again calling on the Afghan leader to sign an agreement to allow U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond this year.

President Barack Obama met with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other military commanders at the White House Tuesday. They were expected to discuss a report, in The New York Times, that Karzai met with Taliban officials in Dubai three weeks ago, without consulting the United States.

The Pentagon is not confirming the reports, according to Defense Department spokesman U.S. Army Colonel Steve Warren.

""We've long said that the path to peace here is political and diplomatic and not military and I believe that we've long said that Afghans speaking to Afghans are what's going to bring about peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" he said.

The Senate Armed Services Committee also met Tuesday, behind closed doors, to discuss the issue.

Republican Senator John McCain said the Obama administration's announcement that it would conclude the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan by the end of this year was likely a factor in Karzai's reported decision to negotiate with the Taliban. McCain said he had been told that the White House was considering withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by 2017, when Obama leaves office.

'President Karzai is paranoid and irrational; but, like most people with paranoia, there is a basis for that,' he said. 'And when he reads that the United States is planning on having everybody out by 2017, then he makes accommodations, such as trying to negotiate with the Taliban. That is completely understandable.'

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Obama has not decided on the post-2014 U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan. He said that decision cannot be made until the Afghan leader signs a bilateral security agreement.

He said, 'I can tell you that as each day passes and we move further into this calendar year, it becomes more imperative that the Afghan government sign the agreement that was negotiated in good faith, so that NATO and the United States can make plans for a post-2014 troop presence. Absent a signed BSA, there will be no and can be no U.S. troops beyond 2014.'

The U.S. has been calling on Karzai to sign the agreement soon, to give NATO time to prepare for a post-combat role for its troops in Afghanistan.

U.S.-Afghan relations have been strained in recent months, and Karzai announced in November that he would not sign a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. until after Afghanistan's April 5 presidential election.

The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democrat Carl Levin, said he is more interested in whether Afghanistan's next president will sign the agreement.

'My advice on this one is to simply not count on Karzai signing a bilateral security agreement, because it's obvious that he's either not or unlikely,' he said. 'But you don't need him to, because it's the next president, who will be more reliable than Karzai, in any event.'

The Afghan leader has also released some Taliban militants from prison and accused the U.S. of war crimes.

THE REMAINS of the two Slovak soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan shortly after Christmas were brought to Slovakia on the afternoon of December 29.

The two soldiers, Edmund Makovník from Košice (aged 34) and Patrik Fraštiak from Kysucké Nové Mesto (39), died in the December 27 terrorist attack against a military convoy in Kabul, along with one American soldier.

The two Slovak soldiers were in the leading armoured vehicle, while a Slovak soldier who was sitting in the second vehicle emerged unscathed, Defence Minister Martin Glváč said at a briefing on December 28, as quoted by the TASR newswire.

One trooper was killed instantly during the ambush, while the other died en route to hospital.

“It was a usual routine work, performed many times a day under the command of the lead country - in this case the US,” TASR quoted Glváč as saying. “This was a terrorist attack in which a civilian car full of explosives was probably remotely detonated [when the convoy was passing by].”

The dead soldiers were part of a five-member Slovak group that was making preparations for the arrival of another batch of 78 Slovak soldiers at the military camp close to Kabul, scheduled for January 1, 2014, according to TASR.

The bodies of the two soldiers were brought home on the final stage of the journey from the American Ramstein Air Base in Germany on the Government aircraft, with Prime Minister Robert Fico and Defence Minister Martin Glváč on board, TASR reported. A memorial service was held at Ramstein before departure.

After the arrival of the plane, a ceremony was also held at the Bratislava airport, with the families of the soldiers attending and accepting the condolences of Slovakia’s highest state and military officials.

Both soldiers will be buried with military honours.

"http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-delfin-santos-jr-20130721,0,7914971.story",Delfin Santos Jr. dies at 24; Army specialist,"Delfin Santos Jr. was in Army basic training when his father died.

His father was himself an Army veteran, a prisoner of war during World War II who died in his 90s. Santos listened — really listened — to his father’s stories as a child and promised he’d join the military someday.

So it was fitting, his sister said, that the younger Santos was buried recently next to his father — for whom he was named — in the Philippines.

On April 6, the 24-year-old cavalry scout’s unit came under attack in Afghanistan’s Zabul province, according to the Department of Defense. Santos died in Kandahar of his wounds from a car bomb blast.

Four other Americans were killed: two other soldiers, a civilian and Anne Smedinghoff, 25, a Foreign Service diplomat. The group was traveling to deliver books to Afghan children, Santos’ family said.

Santos was assigned to the 5th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Armor Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division at Ft. Stewart, Ga.

Santos — known to his family as D.J. for Delfin Jr. — was born in the Pampanga province of the Philippines. He was a toddler when his family moved to the Bay Area in the early 1990s, and he attended schools in Santa Clara and San Jose.

He moved back to the Philippines to finish high school and later returned to the U.S. He is survived by two sisters and 13 half siblings.

Santos’ father doted on him, recalled his sister, Darlene Santos. His father was in his 70s when Santos was born. He would stand in family’s yard in the Philippines, Darlene said, beaming as Santos rode a bicycle and exclaiming, “I can’t believe I had a boy again!”

As a young man, Santos preferred spending time with his family to going out with friends. His two sisters would tease him, telling him they would find girls for him to date to get him to be more social. But he was “very picky, old-fashioned,” Darlene said, laughing.

“He just always wants to spend more time with us,” she said. “He’s funny. He’s sweet.”

Santos joined the Army in December 2006, and his sister, Sgt. Madeleine Santos, enlisted shortly afterward. They both deployed to Iraq, and Madeleine was able to visit his base.

Santos reenlisted in 2011, Darlene said.

It was always Darlene who took Santos to and from the airport. After a stint at Ft. Sill, Okla., Santos got off the plane wearing a cowboy hat and boots and a smile at his sister’s shocked expression.

Darlene dropped him off at the airport in October as he left for his deployment to Afghanistan.

Santos called home often. He would check on his mother, asking her if she took her medication. He would joke with his sisters. And he would talk to Darlene’s and Madeleine’s young daughters.

“Before my uncle passed away, he told me to take care of my grandma and my mom and always be good and remember to eat vegetables,” said Darlene’s 10-year-old daughter, Camille. “He always makes me eat my vegetables. He made me not afraid of them anymore.”

Santos’ family is keeping his most treasured possession: a silver Toyota Tacoma. His Beats by Dr. Dre headphones are still inside. A fellow soldier in Afghanistan would tease him, saying he was going to buy the truck from Santos when they got back to California. Santos said he’d never allow it.

He kept the truck spotless. He kept everything spotless, really. After going through his possessions after his death, a casualty assistance officer told his family she had never seen a young man so organized, Darlene said.

Days before his death, Santos’ family sent him a care package with a few of his requests: laundry detergent, some chips.

Santos’ sisters talked to him on Skype just before he died. They were joking, but he turned serious. If something happened to him, he said, he wanted to be buried next to his father.

After his father’s death, Santos wrote a letter to him from basic training, and it was placed in the grave. No one knows what it says.

Santos never saw his father’s grave. He and his sisters had been planning a trip to the Philippines to see it as soon as he returned from Afghanistan.

http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/161642/,Taliban behead boys for spying in Afghan province,"PanARMENIAN.Net - The Taliban have beheaded two boys for spying in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, officials say, according to BBC News.

One of the boys, a 10-year-old, is reported to have regularly accepted food handouts from police in the Zhari district to feed his family.

Kandahar's governor condemned the beheading as inhumane and un-Islamic. The Taliban denied killing him and condemned it as well.

Little is known about the other boy, who was 16 years old.

In 2012 the Taliban were accused of beheading a 12-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl in south and east Afghanistan - the group denied responsibility in both those cases.

The 10-year-old boy was very poor and was known to take food going spare from the police to take home to his family. His killing is said to have taken place on Sunday, June 9, but news only emerged on Monday as the provincial government condemned it and asked the public to report suspicious behaviour and people.

Later on Monday Kandahar's provincial government posted an update saying that a 16-year-old had also been beheaded by the Taliban.

Correspondents say that the Taliban are known to attack those they suspect of colluding with police and that the Taliban regularly deny such atrocities.

But Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi insisted to the BBC that the group had not beheaded any children in the area.

Taliban fighters in Afghanistan have been known to behead targets in the past, but have always denied attacking children in this way.",Q1
http://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/commitment-change-strategic-plan-2014-2017,Commitment for Change: Strategic plan 2014-2017 - Afghanistan,"Afghanistan is changing and so is the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan. During the month of February, SCA’s Strategic Plan for 2014-2017 will be launched in different provinces where SCA is working. Ministers, ambassadors, experts in the area and different media was invited to the first launch held at the Serena Hotel in Kabul, a launch where sustainability and corruption were discussed.

The main speakers were the SCA Secretary General Anna-Karin Johansson, the Ambassador of Sweden to Afghanistan, Mr. Peter Semneby and the Minister of Economy, Mr. Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal and in the end Mr. Shah Mahmood, Director of finance at SCA summarized the day.

Anna-Karin Johansson emphasized how the name for the strategic plan, “Commitment for Change” is closely linked to how Afghanistan, since the start of SCA in 1980, has a place in the hearts of many Swedes and that SCA has no intentions to leave the country.

– We have seen a positive change in Afghanistan the last ten years, but there are also new challenges. The surroundings have changed and so have SCA. We have reviewed out strengths and weaknesses in order to move forward said Anna-Karin Johansson who explained that the focus of the work will be on women, children and persons with disabilities living mainly in rural areas, in order to secure their means of living.

– SCA has a unique role in Afghanistan and is a partner to us in many sectors said Mr. Peter Semneby the ambassador of Sweden to Afghanistan who was second up on stage. He continued his reflections by focusing on the future and how Sweden’s increased commitment in Afghanistan after Tokyo 2012 shows that the long-term commitment from Sweden in the country will not stop, even though the troops are leaving.

The fact that SCA has been working in Afghanistan for 32 years is a sign of commitment and so thinks the Minister of Economics Mr. Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal.

– SCA have for many years been there for the people, and we have seen significant differences thanks to you, but there are other challenges now said Mr. Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal. The minister emphasized that two major goals for the coming years is to create food safety and possibilities to employment for the youth. He explained further that sustainability in terms of long-term employments will decrease the insecurity in the country and that it is necessary to start looking into Afghanistan’s own resources.

An important statement was mentioned by Mr. Shah Mahmood when he emphasized that SCA has no governmental influence. It is an independent organization working for the afghan people.

At the end of the launch Mr. Zemarai Saqeb, moderated a panel to which the audience could ask questions which mainly came to focus on sustainability, insecurity and the future. One question about the future was whether SCA is going to expand its work to more provinces, and the answer to that is no. SCA will focus to increase the quality of the already existing work we do in the 17 provinces we are working in answered Anna-Karin Johansson.

– We stay as long as we are needed. If 30 years more are necessary, we will stay these 30 years, but let us hope that we will not be needed that long answered Anna-Karin Johansson to the question on how long SCA is planning to continue its work in Afghanistan.

But the final report said Page was ""likely hit"" by small arms projectile, causing gunshot wounds.

The court of inquiry interviewed seven soldiers, two of them for the first time. ""Soldier C"" gave evidence he had also witnessed the friendly fire incident, known as blue-on-green. Soldier C ""recognised"" an NDS soldier who fired upon Major Craig Wilson and Lance Cpl Rory Malone.

The report said there was no evidence that Malone or Wilson returned fire.

Tales of heroics and stonewalling from New Zealand's allies are also revealed in the Court of Inquiry findings, which have just been made public. It has emerged Malone was initially shot in the right leg - an injury that was reported but untreated as he continued to help his wounded mates. He was hit by a second fatal shot on his left flank and killed almost instantly.

Lance Cpl Pralli Durrer was shot and given treatment in a light armoured vehicle before being evacuated by American helicopters, but died on his way to a US hospital.

Crucial information was withheld from the Court of Inquiry by their allies. The US did not release mission reports from the helicopter gunships and the court found US air support inadvertently helped the insurgents find cover.

""Evidence suggests that the use of the fast air to drop flares as a show of force may have assisted the insurgents in obtaining cover.""

Investigators were not able to interview Afghan forces involved in the firefight. A further complicating factor was Lance Cpl Jacinda Baker's tragic death in an explosion just two weeks later.

Baker had treated the wounded Afghan forces at Forward Operating Base Do Abe after the August 4 contact, and would have had comprehensive knowledge of their injuries.

""Due to lack of access to NDS sources, and the subsequent death of LCpl Baker on 19 Aug 12, the court has not been able to confirm specific details of the nature of injuries relating to the NDS casualties.""

A lack of scene examination at the site of the firefight was a ""lost opportunity to gain valuable intelligence"", the report said.

The Court of Inquiry also backed claims by Page that there was a lack of command. ""The command and control of the entire contact on 4 August 2012 was problematic due to the scale of the contact, the involvement of the ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces), the terrain and the communication systems available.""

The U.S. government has been negotiating a bilateral security agreement with their Afghan counterparts, which would set the terms for the future presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan once their current mandate expires by the end of 2014.

2/10 Security Forces Assistance Brigade

PAKTIKA PROVINCE, Afghanistan (May 14, 2013) --The 2/10 Security Forces Assistance Brigade deployed several U.S. Army medical personnel as part of the Security Force Advisory Teams in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 13.

Currently U.S. Army medics are working to improve an integrated, capability-based health care system to triage, treat, evacuate, and return Afghan National Army soldiers to duty. The U.S. medics are helping the Afghans to excel through integration of medical planners, fielding an enduring sustainment system and enabling the Afghans to manage the development of their medical treatment facilities.

Afghan medics have continually shown they can practice combat medicine exceptionally well. The medical leaders have shown they can be independent problem solvers and can coordinate effectively with adjacent units within their brigade to ensure that critical medical supplies make their way to combat operations.

The ANA is making steady progress in their integrated medical system. Due to the time it takes to train medical personnel, some positions are unfilled in the units and medical treatment facilities but what's missing in personnel is made up for in Afghan dedication.

Medical evacuation can be a slow process by ground convoy movements, often times over long distances and sometimes through dangerous areas, but as the Afghan Air Force continues to develop and grow aerial evacuations are on the rise.

U.S. medics have been tasked with advising and assisting ANA medical personnel in establishing enduring capabilities that will outlast the U.S. presence in Afghanistan.

'These SFATs are literally the tip of the spear in OEF 13,' said Col. Dennis S. Sullivan, Commander of 2/10 Security Forces Assistance Brigade.

U.S. medics have assessed their Afghan partner's Role I and Role II unit level medical care.

Role I consists of; self-aid, buddy-aid, examination, and emergency lifesaving measures.

Role II is made up of physician directed resuscitation and stabilization capabilities along with support activities such as; preventive medicine, x-ray, dental and laboratory capabilities. Also assessed were medical evacuation procedures, logistical coordination, mission planning, and facility functions.

'Figuring out the problems was easy; helping these guys to do something about their problems is the hard part,' said Sgt. Mike Gianelle, a medic assigned to 2nd Battalion, 15th Field Artillery Regiment.

Prior to deployment, the medical personnel attended rigorous training rotations at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., and the SFAT Academy based out of Fort Polk, La. They learned about Afghan culture, government agencies, the Afghan National Army, and received refresher training on U.S. Army tactics, procedures, and survival, escape and evasion techniques.

In addition, SFAT medics completed Dari and Pashtu language training, foreign weapons training, cultural awareness training and performed many battle drills in order to prepare themselves for their mission in Afghanistan.

Pre-deployment training has given the medics the ability to overcome cultural and language challenges, and through repetition, they have made tremendous progress in the efficiency of the medical care provided by Afghan medics.

'We are very fortunate to have the American Soldiers here working with us to improve the safety of Afghanistan,' said the executive officer assigned to 5th Kandak, 2nd Brigade, 203rd Corps. 'My soldiers and I welcome all the Americans as guests in our country. You all have left your loved ones and traveled a long way to be with us, and we want you all to return safely to your families.'

http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/29791/,"‘Article 226 makes it clear that all elections, except for PM and Ms, would be held by secret ballot’","ISLAMABAD (APP): The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday adjourned hearing in a presidential reference seeking opinion on open balloting for the upcoming Senate elections till Thursday.

A five-member larger bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mushir Alam, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi heard the reference.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, while continuing his arguments, said the Constitution did not mention the procedure for the election of NA speaker and deputy speaker and Senate chairman and deputy chairman.

The house officials conducted the elections where the Constitution did not specify the procedure, he said. The outgoing speaker served as returning officer for the election of the next one, he added.

He said the elections whose procedure was stipulated in the Constitution, would be considered under the Constitution.

The Constitution called for the creation of national and provincial assemblies, he added.

Justice Ijaz observed that the court understood the crux of his argument that the Constitution called to form offices and bodies, but the method of their election was in the law not in the Constitution.

The AGP said the offices of national and provincial assemblies were not constituted under the Constitution but under the law. The Constitution provided their composition, but laws and acts had been made for their elections, he added.

He said the duration of the parliament, the modus operandi, the number of sittings, etcetera were stated but the Constitution did not specify the procedure for the elections.

He said only the number of elected representatives was mentioned in the Constitution, but laws and acts were made for their election by the constituents.

The AGP said the number of special seats for women and minority and full composition of the parliament were provided in the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz asked how the elections were held for the women reserved seats.

The AGP replied that women seats were allocated by the winning ratio of the political parties. It was written in the Constitution that the National Assembly (NA) elections were held under the law, he added.

Addressing the AGP, the CJP said according to him (AGP) the NA elections were held by law.

Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan said the Act 2017 called for elections by secret ballot.

The AGP said Article 59 provided the composition of the Senate. The word act was also used for women in the Senate, he added.

He said direct votes and constituencies had been mentioned for the NA but direct elections were not mentioned for the Senate.

Justice Bandial said the formal procedure for the election of NA members was given in the law but not for the Senate.

The AGP said the procedure for Senate elections was different as members of provincial assemblies proposed the candidates for the Senate. Independent candidates could also participate in the Senate elections, he added.

Justice Ijaz said the members of the provincial assemblies should be allowed to exercise their votes freely.

The attorney general said elections of Senate chairman, deputy chairman, prime minister and the chief ministers were not clear in the Election Commission and the Election Act. Article 60 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the Senate chairman, he added.

Justice Ijaz said Articles 53 and 60 of the Constitution did not mention that there would be open ballot elections or secret elections.

The attorney general said the elections of the NA speaker and Senate chairman would be held through secret balloting under the Article 266.

He said it was clear in the Constitution that the outgoing NA speaker would conduct the election of the speaker. The first task of the elected assembly would be the election of the speaker, he added.

He said the elections of the prime minister, NA speaker and Senate chairman were not conducted under the Election Act.

He said the parliament itself conducted the elections of the prime minister, Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.

He said Article 53 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the speaker but Senate and NA elections were not held under the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz said Article 226 made it clear that all elections, except for the prime minister and the chief ministers, would be held by the secret ballot.

The AGP said the chapter on elections held under the law was different.

The Article 226 did not apply to every election, he added.

The chief justice said if Article 226 applied, the elections for reserved seats could not take place.

He said elections for the national and provincial assemblies were held under the law.

The attorney general said all laws were framed in accordance with the Constitution.

He said political parties submit lists for representation on reserved seats.

He said an independent candidate could contest the Senate election if he was nominated and proposed by a member of the provincial assembly.

Justice Ijaz said if any member of the provincial assembly wanted to vote against the party, he should use open balloting.

The attorney general said generally people considered election only on voting day but the election machinery was also part of the voting process. Elections were not just about voting as it had many stages, he added.

He said constituency elections, preparation of voter lists, delimitation, nomination papers, voting schedule, voting and results were all the stages.

The chief justice said those were the stages of direct elections.

The attorney general said whether there was an assembly or not, the president could issue an ordinance related to the elections.

He said the Senate Election Act of 1975 also laid down the procedure for holding Senate elections.

He said elections under the law could not be challenged but only elections held under the statute could be challenged in tribunals.

Justice Ijaz said elections under the law could be challenged under the Constitution.

The attorney general said the vote of an ordinary citizen was free but the vote of a member of provincial assembly (MPA) given to a senator was not free.

When the MPA’s vote for the Senate could not be free, then the ballot could not be secret, he added.

Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan said it was unwise to vote for another senator by secret ballot in violation of party discipline.

The MPA violating party discipline should have moral courage to openly say that he had voted against the party discipline, he added.

Upon this, Justice Bandial said this was moral, not legal. The MPA had the right to vote according to his will, he added.

The chief justice said the courts were the guardians of the Constitution.

Justice Yahya Afridi addressing the AGP said his argument was moral in nature and the matter was political.

He said the question raised in the presidential reference was legal and ethical but the matter was political.

He asked the attorney general that his case was based on ethics while the issue was political.

He asked why the government was seeking the opinion of the court instead of approaching the parliament?

The attorney general said the government had only approached the SC for an opinion.

If the opinion of the SC was in government’s favour, the final decision was to be taken by the parliament, he added.

He said the SC had given its opinion on the NA’s resolution regarding recognizing Bangladesh.

Justice Afridi said the AGP’s argument regarding Bangladesh was correct.

The attorney general said he could give eleven examples of cases in which the court ruled despite the presence of political aspects.

He said the apex court disqualified politicians by interpreting the law in dual citizenship cases.

He said the issue of disclosure of assets of parliamentarians was political but the SC also interpreted the law on it.

The government had come to the SC to stop the sale and purchase of votes and for transparency, he added.

Justice Ijaz asked the AGP whether he was just asking the court to interpret the Article 226 only?

The attorney general responded that he could not put it more simply.",Q1

Manning is expected to speak at his sentencing on Wednesday. Pentagon officials testified last week in the prosecution phase that Manning’s leaks put people in danger, including Afghan villagers who faced Taliban reprisals.

He faces up to 90 years behind bars on convictions ranging from theft to violations of the Espionage Act.

One 68-year-old on the petition suggested that volunteers serve Manning’s sentence from oldest to youngest.

“If we each volunteer to serve part of his sentence… it would bring attention to the amount of time this young man has been sentenced to and, hopefully reduce his sentence to time served,” states the petition, which was close to its goal of 4,000 signatures.

“Bradley Manning provided information to the American people which our own government would not provide. He did us all a favor and, in turn I am willing to serve part of his sentence.”

They intend on emailing the petition to Maj. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan.

http://www.rafu.com/2012/08/chens-supporters-encouraged-by-sentencing-of-second-soldier/?cmfmd=159748,Chen’s Supporters Encouraged by Sentencing of Second Soldier,"FORT BRAGG, N.C. — Supporters of Pvt. Danny Chen, a 19-year-old NewYorker who committed suicide last year in Afghanistan, were encouraged Monday by the sentencing of one of the soldiers court-martialed in the case.

Specialist Ryan Offutt, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of hazing and two specifications of maltreatment and was sentenced to six months of confinement, a reduction in rank to private, and a bad-conduct discharge from the Army.

He is one of eight soldiers court-martialed for subjecting Chen to racial slurs and physical abuse for weeks before he took his own life in October. Chen’s family and other supporters have been attending the proceedings at Fort Bragg.

Offutt had also been charged with negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, assault, violating regulations, and additional counts of maltreatment, but those charges were dropped in exchange for his guilty plea.

New York City Councilmember Margaret Chin commented, “This sentence is a victory for the Chen family and for all Americans. We cannot tolerate bullying and hazing in our military or in our society. Spc. Offutt used a multitude of racial slurs against Pvt. Chen, hurled rocks at him, and physically abused him.

“I am proud that the Army has taken a stand against hazing and handed down a bad-conduct discharge in this case. The removal of Spc. Offutt from the Army is necessary to make clear that the United States military will not tolerate racism, bigotry, and abuse at the hands of superior officers.

“The Chen family has fought for justice for their son, and for all of servicemen and women. This sentence ensures that Spc. Offutt will never again have the opportunity to harm or harass a fellow soldier. I hope this sentence sends a message to anyone who is suffering from bullying and hazing in the armed forces. Now is the time to speak out. This type of conduct is unacceptable and those who perpetrate this behavior must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Last month, Sgt. Adam Holcomb, 30, was found guilty of assault and maltreatment, but was acquitted of negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, communicating a threat, and hazing. Chen’s supporters were disappointed by the sentence — 30 days in prison, a reduction in rank, and a month’s pay.

To protest that decision, the New York chapter of OCA (Organization of Chinese Americans), Asian American Arts Centre and other community organizations held a rally at Columbus Park in Lower Manhattan’s Chinatown on Aug. 11.

“The public and the military needs to see our determination for justice,” OCA-NY said in a statement. “Evidence demonstrating racial abuse cannot be minimized and hypothetically accounted for without making a travesty of justice. This is an issue that addresses everyone. all people need to see a reversal of this tradition of military practice that permits and excuses hazing of every color.”",Q1

The figure emerges from a Fairfax Media investigation of more than 1100 boats and nearly 70,000 people who have set out since 1989. Forty of those trips have resulted in known drownings.

The latest deaths off the coast of West Java mark a grim milestone: the number of asylum seekers who have drowned while trying to reach Australia has now passed 1500.

Friday's sinking near the Javanese coastline has claimed the lives of two children, but more children are expected to be among more than 20 people who remain missing.

The investigation into nearly a quarter-century's worth of boat arrivals, largely from Indonesia – a matter dismissed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the weekend as a “passing irritant” – compares the rate of boat journeys per 100 days and drownings per 1000 passengers under each prime minister.

It shows the latter years of Bob Hawke's time in office and the era of Paul Keating were quiet, with only a handful of boats arriving in any year and no passengers drowning.

Under John Howard, boat arrivals crept up to about six per 100 days, with a mortality rate of just shy of 26 per 1000 passengers. The deaths were almost exclusively from the sinking of the SIEV X.

From there, the rate of boat arrivals tripled during the first term of Kevin Rudd, although the rate of deaths declined to just shy of 22 per 1000 people.",Q1
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/06/fort-hood-nidal-hasan-trial-shooter,Fort Hood suspect Nidal Hasan: 'Evidence will show I am the shooter',"The man suspected of carrying out the Fort Hood military base shooting, which left 13 dead and dozens injured, has told a court-martial that ""the evidence will clearly show I am the shooter"".

Nidal Hasan, an army major, faces the death penalty if he is found guilty of the attack, which happened on 5 November 2009. He is representing himself in a Fort Hood courtroom, where he is expected to cross-examine some of his victims.

In opening remarks, Hasan, who has never denied the shooting, said he had carried out the attack in ""defence of others"".

On the day of the attack, dozens of witnesses are said to have seen Hasan enter a section of the base used to prepare soldiers for overseas deployment. Hasan allegedly shouted out ""Allahu Akhbar"" – ""god is great"" – before opening fire on colleagues.

Hasan spent two minutes presenting his opening statement in court, not far from where the attack took place.

""Evidence will show I was on the wrong side of America's war, and I later switched sides,"" he said. Hasan described himself as a mujahideen and said evidence would also show ""that we are imperfect Muslims trying to establish the perfect religion … I apologize for any mistakes I made in this endeavor.""

Hasan, 42, was scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan as a military psychiatrist the month of the shooting. He said the attack was carried out in defence of Muslim insurgents fighting US soldiers in Afghanistan, although the trial judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, has ruled that this strategy fails as a matter of law and will not allow him to offer evidence in relation to a ""defence of others"" argument.

A military judge found Hasan competent to defend himself, which means he could end up questioning his victims directly. Thirteen people died in the shooting and 32 were injured; Hasan is paralysed from the waist down, having been shot by officers responding to the attack. He presented his case from a wheelchair.

Military prosecutor Colonel Steve Henricks told jurors on Tuesday that Hasan planned to ""kill as many soldiers as he could"", and said the prosecution will show jurors that Hasan picked the date of the attack for a reason. Henricks told jurors that the shooting was meticulously planned. He said that on the day of the attack Hasan stuffed paper towels into the pockets of his cargo pants, to muffle to sound of his concealed weapons.

""All those fully loaded magazines do not clink, do not move, do not give him away,"" Henricks said.

Hasan tried to clear the area of civilians as he walked through and opened fire inside the building, Henricks said. He added that Hasan only shot at one civilian, who had attempted to stop the attack.

Hasan had offered to plead guilty in exchange for being spared the death penalty, but Osborn rejected this at an earlier hearing. While the prosecution is seeking his execution, if Hasan is sentenced to death it will likely take years before the sentence is carried out. The military has not executed an active-duty soldier since 1961. Five men are on military death row, but none is close to an execution date.

The trial is scheduled to last at least a month, but Osborn told jurors to prepare for several months.",Q1

The reputed Taliban Ghaziabad district chief was among four suspected militants killed in the strike Friday night, the provincial security chief for Kunar said.

Khaama Press said the attack, which did not cause any civilian casualties, was the second drone raid in the past week in Kunar. Around six militants were killed in Tuesday's attack in the Chapa Dahra district.

The Taliban, however, also appeared to be on the offensive this weekend. A pair of overnight bombings shook Balkh province and the capital, Kabul, early Saturday.

Between eight and 13 people were injured when a suicide bomber set off a device in a market in the Chahar Bolok district of Balkh province Saturday, the provincial government said.

In Kabul, someone planted a bomb on a police vehicle; however the explosion did not cause any injuries.

Ending weeks of speculation, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday appointed Lt Gen Raheel Sharif (left) as Pakistan's new army chief and Lt Gen Rashid Mehmood as the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee.

Prime Minister Sharif recommended the names of the two commanders, who were endorsed by President Mamnoon Hussain. The president promoted both the lieutenant generals to the general rank.

Lt Gen Sharif will replace 61-year-old Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani who would hang his boots on Friday after being at the helm of the army for six years.

Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Sharif held separate meetings in Islamabad with Chief of General Staff Lt Gen Mahmood and Inspector General Training and Evaluation Lt Gen Sharif.



""The meetings discussed professional matters and matters relating to national security,"" a senior government official told PTI.

Lt Gen Sharif's prior appointments include commander, Gujranwala XXX corps, commandant of the Pakistan military academy Kakul and general officer commanding Lahore. Lt Gen Mahmood has served as the corps commander of Lahore. He was also the military secretary to former president Rafiq Tarar.

Mahmood comes from the Baloch regiment and had served under General Kayani as Inter-Services Intelligence deputy director general. Both generals have superseded Lt Gen Haroon Aslam, currently the chief of the logistics staff and the senior most general after Kayani. He is scheduled to retire in April.

In a surprise move, Kayani had scotched speculation of a possible extension by issuing a statement on October 6 saying, ""My tenure ends on November 29, 2013. On that day I will retire.""

A change of the command ceremony has been planned for November 29. Sharif will host a farewell dinner for Kayani on Wednesday.

Lt Gen Sharif is the brother of Nishan-e-Haider medal recipient for valour, Shabbir Sharif, who was killed in the 1971 war with India.

Sharif is said to be a key player in developing new doctrines for COIN/CT, where the infantry training manual has essentially been re-written under his watch to move the largest fighting arm and backbone of the army from the traditional India-centric role to a more diversified counterinsurgency capacity.

Sharif is said to enjoy close connections with former army chiefs and top brass as well as Lahore's political elite.

Mahmood, who enjoys good relation with the Nawaz family, is another key confidant of Kayani and is his principal staff officer. He is seen as the Kayani's second set of eyes.

Five chief of general staff -- Yahya Khan, Gul Hassan Khan, Mirza Aslam Beg, Asif Nawaz and Jahangir Karamat -- have made it to the post of the army chief while another three -- Aziz Khan, Tariq Majid and Khalid Shameem Wynne -- made it to the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee.

Kayani was handpicked by former military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf as the army chief in 2007. He was given an unprecedented three-year extension by the then premier Yousuf Raza Gilani in 2010.

The selection of the chief of the Pakistani army, often described as the state within the state, has not been an easy task for the civilian government and especially for the once bitten, twice shy Sharif. This was the fourth time Sharif picked up an army chief.

He picked up Abdul Waheed Kakar as the army chief in 1993 but the general soon ditched him and played a key role in Sharif's resignation. Kakar had superseded at least four senior generals.

In 1998, he handpicked Pervez Musharraf to head the army and he too had superseded at least two generals. Musharraf first plotted the Kargil misadventure derailing

Sharif's India-Pakistan peace dialogue in 1999 and then engineered a coup against the Prime Minister in the same year.

Sharif selected Ziauddin Butt in October 1999 but he could not take over as the army chief due to the coup by Musharraf.

The new army chief would be in command while the pullout of international forces starts from neighbouring Afghanistan and the operation/negotiation game between the Pakistani Taliban and the Nawaz Sharif government. He can also influence the government's diplomatic dance with India, the United States, China and the Gulf states, as well as more local, security-centric initiatives, like energy efficiency and stabilising Balochistan, the Express Tribune had reported.

Baroness Thatcher's family met at her home to make final arrangements today just hours after a stirring full military rehearsal for the Iron Lady's funeral had taken place before dawn.



Major Andrew Chatburn, the man in charge of choreographing the parade, said the rehearsal 'went very well' and claimed it was 'vitally important' to stage a trial of Wednesday's event.



More than 700 serving Armed Forces personnel gathered in central London before dawn as a Union flag-draped coffin was carried on a horse-drawn gun carriage from St Clement Danes, the church of the Royal Air Force, down the Strand to St Paul's Cathedral.

Meanwhile Lady Thatcher's twins, Mark and Carol, spent time at her grand house in Belgravia today, and were later joined by Mark's wife Sarah and their children Michael and Amanda.

The procession band played the funeral marches of Chopin, Beethoven and Mendelssohn as it made its way along the deserted streets.

The pensioners from Royal Hospital Chelsea did not take part today due to the early start, but they will line the west steps of St Paul's for the real event.



Maj Chatburn said: 'The point of the rehearsal is to prove the route, make sure that the soldiers, sailors and airmen are familiar with their duties and to prove the timings.



'There is always scope for error but we try to eliminate that as much as we possibly can.



'We'll go back now, we'll have a debriefing and we'll take the points from that.

'That creates an atmosphere and for the horses in particular that is another challenge for them.



'But they will handle that because the horses themselves are used to doing duties in central London with lots of crowds around.'



He added: 'Having a large public presence always concentrates the mind that little bit more for everyone.'

Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans MP, speaking on ITV Daybreak, defended the cost of the funeral.



He said the Bishop of Grantham, the Rt Rev Dr Tim Ellis, had 'got it wrong' over his description of the scale and the cost of the funeral as a 'mistake' which may play into the hands of extremists.



'He has got it wrong,' he said.



'I do not know where the £10 million figure has come from. It is going to be substantial sums but when you have got the Queen and other world leaders coming in for this funeral, then you are always going to have substantial security costs.



'So we are where we are.'



He added: 'We have just had an amazing Olympics which cost billions, we have had an amazing Diamond Jubilee which cost well in excess of £10 million - the world was looking at London, we do pomp and ceremony incredibly well. We are talking about marking the passing of the first woman prime minister in this country and indeed of the western world.

The procession, timed to last 19 minutes, will see the Union flag-draped coffin carried on a horse-drawn gun carriage from St Clement Danes, the church of the Royal Air Force, down the Strand on Wednesday morning.

Led by the Band of the Royal Marines, the solemn procession will then slowly travel along Fleet Street towards St Paul's where around 2,000 mourners are expected to attend the service.

The streets of central London will be lined by men and women from all three services along with three marching bands.

These will be the RAF band, which will be closest to St Clement Danes, the Band of the Scots Guards and the Band of the Royal Marines, all with their drums draped in black as a mark of respect. Once at St Paul's, Lady Thatcher's coffin will be met by a Guard of Honour provided by the Prince of Wales Company of the First Battalion Welsh Guards.

A tri-service bearer party, drawn from ships, squadrons and regiments particularly associated with the Falklands, will then place the coffin on their shoulders and the gun carriage will draw away.

The bearer party, dressed in their regimental or service uniform and who have been carefully selected according to their height, will be made up of the Royal Navy/Marines, Scots Guards, Welsh Guards, Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Parachute Regiment, Royal Gurkha Rifles and RAF.

Dawn: While most of Britain slept the dress rehearsal was in full swing this morning

Procession: All the men and women taking a role in Wednesday's funeral were out in force

March: Military personnel will be playing music at the event, which will see the Iron lady's final journey

Moving: British forces' officers escort a Union Jack-draped coffin on a gun carriage drawn by the King's Troop Royal Artillery

They will then carry the coffin up the west steps of St Paul's which will be lined by 14 pensioners from Royal Hospital Chelsea and 18 service personnel: six from the Navy, six from the RAF and six members of the Blues and Royals, Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.

'They are professional service personnel who will address this with the dignity and solemnity and, more importantly, the professional approach that one would expect of the armed services' Major Andrew Chatburn

The officer in command of the bearing party is Major Nicholas Mott of the Welsh Guards, while the chief marshal, who will walk behind the procession band, is Falklands veteran Colonel Hugh Bodington.

The coffin will be carried on one of six First World War-era gun carriages of the Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery, used routinely for gun salutes, most recently to mark the 61st anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne.

The carriage, never used in a funeral before, is likely to be named after Lady Thatcher as is traditional after such occasions. It will be drawn by six black horses, three of them mounted, all with their manes removed to give them a sleeker appearance and stop the harness snagging.

It will be led by a charger named Mister Twister with a second charger to the side of the other six horses, with three soldiers walking alongside the carriage.

Maj Chatburn, previously senior director of music in the Household Division and director of music in the Irish Guards, said the three bands lining the route will play their martial music slightly subdued in keeping with the solemnity of the occasion, such as that played at the cenotaph on Remembrance Day.

They will stop playing as the coffin is lifted at St Clement Danes.

Meanwhile the procession band will be playing the funeral marches of Chopin, Beethoven and Mendelssohn, with the order expected to be determined during a full rehearsal of the parade in the early hours of Monday morning.

Maj Chatburn said the procession poses a ‘significant challenge for the musicians’ as the pace of funeral marches is irregular.

While the pace of the music is 60 beats per minute, the procession will move at 70 beats per minute due to the speed the horses walk. A total of 183 musicians are taking part.

‘The devil is in the detail and if you don't plan, you'll fail,’ Maj Chatburn said.

Concentration: As part of the practice the pall-bearers took the coffin back down the steps afterwards

Exit: After Wednesday's ceremony, Lady Thatcher's coffin will then be taken out of St Paul's

Family: The Iron Lady's body will then be taken to a private cremation, and her ashes will be interred next to her husband Denis's in Chelsea

‘The soldiers, sailors and airmen that we have on parade are all professional soldiers, sailors and airmen first of all. They all come into this specifically for this job, they will concentrate on this for the next two or three days.

‘They are professional service personnel who will address this with the dignity and solemnity and, more importantly, the professional approach that one would expect of the armed services.

‘But that doesn't mean to say that we're complacent at all. We will take whatever lessons we learn from this and we will apply them to whatever comes forth.’

Maj Chatburn said the ‘threat’ of protesters disrupting the procession is a matter for the police.

But the servicemen and women ‘will adapt to whatever is required of them, they are serving soldiers, sailors and airmen’.

He said: ‘Many of these have served in Afghanistan and if there is anything that they have to adapt to, they will adapt with it within the confines of their responsibility.’

No members of Lady Thatcher's family will be walking alongside the coffin and the parade will not feature any civilians, he said.

During the procession the Honourable Artillery Company will fire Processional Minute Guns from the Tower of London with the first round fired as the wheels of the gun carriage start to roll and the last one as the carriage stops outside St Paul's.

Margaret Thatcher’s funeral service will be dominated by movingly patriotic selections of music and verse, chosen by the former Prime Minister herself.



The service, conducted by the Bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres – a long-standing friend of Lady Thatcher – will reflect her public love of her country and her private literary tastes.



Lady Thatcher’s coat of arms is on the front page of the Order of Service, as granted following her elevation to the peerage in 1992. Underneath are the words ‘Cherish Freedom’, her motto.



On the second page is the poem Little Gidding, by T. S. Eliot, written at the height of the Blitz in 1941. The poet was a particular favourite of Lady Thatcher.

Preparations: The Lord Mayor of London, Roger Gifford takes part in a rehearsal for the funeral inside St Paul's

Grand: Mr Gifford stands in the heart of the cathedral, below its world famous dome

The ten-strong bearer party has been deliberately chosen from ships, units and stations ‘notable for their service during the Falklands Campaign’.



The final bill for the funeral may approach £10million. Lady Thatcher’s family is meeting an unspecified amount of the expense, thought to cover transport, flowers and the cremation, with the Government funding the rest, including security.



Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘When it comes to money, the rebate she negotiated for this country from the EU has brought us so far £75billion…I think that puts money in perspective.’

The man tasked with ensuring Baroness Thatcher's funeral parade runs smoothly: Security preparations and rehearsals begin ahead of Wednesday's ceremony

By Mark Duell

He was behind the royal wedding procession two years ago and last year's Diamond Jubilee parade - so Major Andrew Chatburn certainly has plenty of experience in working while the world watches.

The Household Division ceremonial staff officer is in charge of choreographing Baroness Thatcher's funeral parade, which will be the largest Britain has seen since that of the Queen Mother's in 2002.

The military procession leading to the St Paul's Cathedral service in central London will feature more than 700 serving Armed Forces personnel from units particularly associated with the Falklands War.

Major Chatburn said the plans are based on ‘precedent and pragmatism’ with the wishes of the former prime minister herself. He added: ‘Baroness Thatcher had no direct service relationship.

‘On this occasion it was felt appropriate that service personnel who have an association or connection with the Falklands conflict, for which the late prime minister is pretty famous for, was probably the most suitable on this occasion.



'Of course, Baroness Thatcher's wishes will have been taken into account.’

Maj Chatburn said his department has contingency plans for a number of eventualities but did not have one in the event of the death of the Baroness.",Q1

Dempsey's trip, though, has thus far been marred by ongoing violence. Three foreign coalition soldiers were killed in a car bomb attack in southeast Zabul province, NATO officials said. Their identities and nationalities had not been released, the Los Angeles Times said. Another attack on an Afghanistan provincial governor killed a doctor and wounded several others.

Dempsey was scheduled to meet with other U.S. generals and Afghanistan military officials to determine what needs must be met by American soldiers. There are now 100,000 coalition soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan, including 68,000 Americans. Dempsey said he will decide sometime this summer how many will remain in the country, depending on the progress the Afghan army makes in warding off Taliban fighters.",Q1

Bliss, Texas, in early November, if the shutdown ends this week as expected, multiple Army sources told Nextgov.

The Army originally planned to kick off the NIE on Oct. 28, but the shutdown pushed the start of the exercise to Nov. 4, Army sources who declined to be identified said. The exercise is scheduled to go through Nov. 17.

Lack of funds will probably delay a communications exercise slated to start Thursday by the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, to fine tune systems under evaluation, the sources added.

The Army plans to use the Ft. Bliss soldiers to test upgraded troop tracking and command post systems and a broadband, manpack radio system, NIE sources told Nextgov.

The NIE will evaluate hardware and software of the Command Post of the Future developed by General Dynamics C4 Systems. The project combines feeds from different mission command systems so all the data is live and shared in real-time. It is referred to as ‘WYSIWIS,’ or ‘what-you-see-is-what-I-see.’

The NIE will also test the next-generation architecture for the Command Post of the Future, which enables entire theaters of operation to collaborate on a single distributed data repository with thousands of users.

The Army will also test its Joint Battle Command-Platform, an upgrade of its Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below/Blue Force Tracking, or FBCB2/BFT, first fielded in Bosnia in 1998 to automatically track friendly and enemy forces.

Upgrades to the Joint Battle Command-Platform under test at the NIE will include a new user interface with features such as touch-to-zoom maps and drag-and-drop icons, secure data encryption, a faster satellite network, and interoperability with Marine Corps systems. The Army will use the NIE to conduct an operational assessment of the system to assure reliable connectivity with its secure in-line data encryption.

The Army will also conduct follow-up test and evaluation activities to assess and demonstrate the capabilities of the Harris AN/PRC -117G manpack radio, which originally fielded to units in Afghanistan in 2009, with more than 3,000 radios fielded since then.

The AN/PRC-117G is not a formal program of record, and the Army is testing it during the NIE at the request of Office of the Secretary of Defense. User feedback at the NIE will help the Army develop future tactical network modernization plans.

The Army plans acquire 60,000 commercially developed manpack radios that run government-owned software waveforms, along with vehicle and handehled radios, at a cost pegged at $700 million.",Q1

""We support this effort to allow both sides to find a longer-term solution that replaces the sequester permanently in a balanced way so we can stop these harmful cuts that are hurting our economy and middle-class families across the country,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters at the daily briefing.

With FAA furloughs causing coast-to-coast airport delays, Reid has proposed an anti-sequestration bill that would delay the budget cuts for five months, paid for with savings from the winding down of the war in Afghanistan.

The plan does not, however, include new tax revenue, the president's sticking point for any such deal.

""We believe that Senator Reid's proposal is a good one in that it would temporarily delay the sequester and all the negative effects that we're talking about now to air travelers and families and seniors, as well as the job loss and the drag on our economy, in order to allow for the discussions that the president is engaged in to try to find common ground with Republicans to bear fruit so that we can reduce our deficit in a balanced way and eliminate the sequester entirely,"" Carney said.

He stressed that the Reid plan is just a ""Band-Aid."" ""The fact is, on dealing with the sequester, Congress has to act,"" he said.

Farida, 11, lost her eye in Afghanistan to a Taliban-planted bomb

Her father defied the Taliban and sent her to America with a U.S.-based charity to get her medical aid

Farida was emotionally adopted by her American host family and received corrective eye surgery her family's financial circumstances would not have allowed her to get otherwise





Eleven-year-old Farida was just playing in her backyard in Afghanistan when a bomb went off tearing through her eye and killing three of her siblings.

The young girl was given a second chance after her family defied the Taliban and collaborated with U.S. relief forces to give Farida the surgery she needed.



Through Solace for Children, a charity which helps injured children get medical attention, Farida was flown to North Carolina where she was treated for her missing eye and found a second home with a loving American family.



Farida, an 11-year-old girl from Afghanistan who who's eye was taken out by a Taliban bomb, has been given a second family and medical treatment through at North Carolina charity

Though the trip to North Carolina has greatly improved the quality of Farida life, to get her she has also managed to put it in peril.



After the explosion four years ago Farida's father, Abdul Rauf, 47, decided to send his daughter abroad for medical treatment despite the order of the Taliban controlled area, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The Taliban employees violent biblical methods such as stoning, cutting off hands, and gouging out eyes to those who defy their order to avoid contact with insurgent forces, who they identify as Kabul government officials and U.S. military or civilian aid, the newspaper reported.



Despite the physical danger Rauf, who was unable to provide adequate medical care for his wounded daughter being a poor farmer, decided to seek American aid.



Farida poses with her North Carolina host mother Asheli Thompson whose family she is now a part of after staying with them over three summers while she got corrective eye surgery

The Solace for Children charity pairs injured Afghan children with American host families for six weeks during the summer, 'to experience America [and] to experience peace on a foundation of health,' Jim Gray, a board member on the charity told WCNC .

'Some people were saying if the Taliban finds out, they'll cut off your head,' Rauf told the newspaper.



'I asked these people: Are you afraid to have your own children treated? Will you sacrifice your own flesh and blood?'



'I told them: Something good is happening here. Don't be afraid.'

By taking these courageous steps Rauf has provided opportunities for his daughter she would never have been exposed to otherwise.

After three summer getting medical treatment and living with a host family, Farida has completely adjusted to life in the U.S. seen her clutching her iPhone

Originally from a remote village in southern Afghanistan, Farida has adapted quickly to the United States since she arrived three summers ago, and now speaks fluent English complete with American slang, according to the Los Angeles Times.



In North Carolina he wounds were treated so that her left eye socket has now been fitted with a conformer shell, according to the paper, a clear plastic lens which reduces the friction in her eye socket when she blinks.



However, her socket closed over the plastic lens and she now needs further treatment.

She was also given a pair of glasses to correct the altered vision in her right eye and a sparkly purple eye patch to cover her left.

She has also been given a second family here in the United States.



Her host parents Asheli and Eric Thompson view Farida as their own daughter and in turn she calls them 'Mommy' and 'Daddy,' the article states.



The Thompson's, who have two young daughters of their own, gave Frida the full American experience while she stayed with them, taking her on a trip of Disney World, the ocean, and of course, sampling the local cuisine at McDonald's.

Farida is the second injured girl the Thompson's took into their home, both of whom they view as their own.



Three years ago the family hosted a 7-year-old girl who was also injured in a Taliban attack, losing an eye and having part of her fact destroyed by acid.

After the explosion Farida had a conformer shell fitted to her eye and now wears a purple patch and corrective lenses

'It’s humbling, yet just a great feeling to know you've had a positive impact on somebody's life that's been through such trauma,' Eric Thompson told WCNC.



Now back at home Farida's progressive father is making sure the opportunities she was exposed to abroad don't go wasted.



Rauf has enrolled his daughter in school run by the charity in Kabul and does not intend to marry her off at a young age, but rather let her pursue an education, the paper reports.

The blast was heard across the Afghan capital, which has seen a recent drop in insurgent attacks after several high-profile strikes earlier this year.



""We can confirm a suicide car bombing that targeted an ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) convoy coming to Kabul International Airport,"" a spokeswoman with the NATO force said.



""The vehicle detonated too early and didn't reach the convoy. There were no ISAF casualties."" Interior ministry spokesman Sidiq Sediqqi said there were no Afghan casualties in the attack on the airport, which houses a major NATO military base as well as operating civilian flights to cities including Dubai, New Delhi and Istanbul.



Flights were delayed only briefly after the bomb exploded.



The Taliban, who regularly exaggerate casualty numbers, claimed responsiblity via their main Twitter account, saying ten soldiers had been killed or injured and two German vehicles destroyed.



Afghan and NATO troops quickly sealed off the scene around the mangled remains of the attacker's car seen outside an airport entrance used by workers.



A series of suicide bomb and gun attacks earlier this year targeted foreign compounds, the Supreme Court, the airport and the presidential palace in the capital.



In October, a similar car bomb attack killed two civilians outside a compound housing foreign workers near the airport.



NATO forces are withdrawing from Afghanistan after more than a decade of fighting, but negotiations have stalled on a security accord that would allow some US and NATO troops to stay after 2014.



Karzai initially endorsed the security pact, but has since refused to sign and issued fresh demands.

http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2014/01/14/robert-gates-book-portrays-obama-as-different-kind-of-president/4479715/,Robert Gates’ book portrays Obama as different kind of president,"Like just about everybody else in Washington and many across the country, I’ve been reading the excerpts from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates’ book “Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary of War.”

It presents a significantly more negative picture of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton than Gates’ statements in office led anyone to expect.

And it presents an interesting contrast with Gates’ previous memoir, “From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider’s Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War,” published in 1996.

To be sure, Gates in “Duty” says many positive things about his most recent former colleagues. He calls Obama’s decision to target Osama bin Laden the “most courageous” presidential decision he has seen.

He praises Clinton’s judgment, her sense of humor and her penchant for hard work. Though he doesn’t make the point explicitly in the excerpt, the secretary of state and secretary of defense weren’t constant and mistrustful antagonists.

But he also presents some damning testimony. Listening to Obama soon after he had ordered a surge of troops into Afghanistan, “I thought: The president doesn’t trust his commander, can’t stand (Hamid) Karzai, doesn’t believe in his own strategy and doesn’t consider the war to be his. For him, it’s all about getting out.”

If this is not cynical enough, he is shocked that Clinton and Obama admit that their opposition to the Iraq surge was politically motivated — in the presence of Gates, who was in the chain of command on the surge and helped make it work.

As for Vice President Joe Biden, Gates writes that he “has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy issue” over four decades. And he expresses even more angry contempt for congressional leaders.

Gates wrote “Duty” after leaving government with no intention or expectation of ever returning. But he wrote “From the Shadows,” published in 1996, in similar circumstances.

He had risen quickly from a junior Russia analyst at the CIA to positions at the National Security Council in the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and first Bush administrations. He was nominated to be CIA director in 1986, but withdrew in the face of congressional opposition; he was nominated again for the post and confirmed in 1991.

In “From the Shadows” he does not always fawn on the leaders he served. “No stranger man in American history” is his verdict on Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan “began to fade a bit beginning in late 1985-early 1986.”

He has especially warm praise for George H.W. Bush and his foreign policy team, and notes that Bush had almost a familial relationship with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft (as George W. Bush would later have with Condoleezza Rice).

He sees Secretary of State James Baker as “a master craftsman of the persuasive and backroom arts at the peak of his powers,” but notes that he “demanded more loyalty of the president than he gave in return.”

Even more notable than the individual portraits in “From the Shadows” is Gates’ argument that there was far more continuity in American foreign policy during the presidencies in which he served than was suggested by partisan rhetoric.

In this view, Nixon’s detente with Russia was sealed by Ford’s Helsinki Accords, whose human rights provisions were built on by Carter, who began the defense buildup accelerated by Reagan, whose negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev provided the basis for Bush’s management of the collapse of the Soviet empire.

Presidents were constantly buffeted from the right and left by members of Congress, but, Gates argues, if the process was unpleasant, the results were usually benign.

In the excerpts from “Duty,” Gates seems to take a similar view of George W. Bush, a “mature leader” who on the Iraq surge “risked reputation, public esteem, credibility, political ruin and the judgment of history on a single decision he believed was the right thing for the country.”

But the excerpts suggest that Gates sees Obama out of line with the continuity he admires in his predecessors.

Clinton and Obama’s cynical opposition to the Iraq surge and Obama’s half-hearted commitment to his Afghanistan strategy are in jarring contrast with his description in “Shadows” of Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush I.

‘’For each,” he writes, “the country came first,” and “each, in his own way, was a modest man.” Let’s see if in the full text of “Duty” he says the same of Obama.

CNN —

Four days after a U.S. civilian-operated cargo jet plunged into the ground shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, killing all seven people aboard, one expert said that a number of factors likely were involved in the incident.

“Accidents, of which this was among the worst that I’ve ever seen, are typically a confluence of circumstances of seemingly unrelated events, which all coalesce to create a disaster,” said Arthur Rosenberg, a pilot, engineer and partner in the New York-based law firm, Soberman & Rosenberg.

The doomed plane’s final moments appear to have been captured by a dashboard camera inside a vehicle on the base.

The approximately three-minute video shows what appears to be the National Airlines jet starting its climb at 11:20 a.m. local time Monday from the base.

National Air Cargo, the parent of National Airlines, said the flight had refueled at Bagram en route from Camp Bastian, a British military base in Afghanistan, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

National said the aircraft had landed uneventfully in Bagram and no additional cargo or people were taken on there, it said.

Prior to departure, the cargo was reinspected, it added.

“The cargo contained within the aircraft was properly loaded and secured, and had passed all necessary inspections prior to departing Camp Bastian,” the company said in a statement posted on its website.

It identified the crew members as two pilots, two first officers, a loadmaster and two people involved in maintenance.

U.S. military plane crashes in Kyrgyzstan

The pilots were likely doing a “maximum performance takeoff” in an attempt to climb to altitude as quickly as possible, thereby limiting exposure to any attempts to shoot it down, Rosenberg said Friday, citing the jet’s pitch attitude, which he said appeared higher than normal.

National Airlines, which specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses, did not immediately return a call asking about whether the pilots had, in fact, performed such a takeoff.

About 12 seconds into the video, the Boeing 747-400 appears to stall, rolls from side to side, and drops.

At 23 seconds, the plane crashes nose first into the ground off the side of the road, erupting into a ball of orange flame and black smoke.

CNN cannot confirm the video’s authenticity. It bears the date 2013/02/01, but date stamps can easily be inaccurate.

The cargo aboard ill-fated Flight NCR102 included five mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles that were being taken out of Afghanistan as part of the drawdown of U.S. forces, said Shirley Kaufman of National Air Cargo.

MRAPs can weigh 12 tons to 24 tons apiece, depending on the model, according to a 2011 Congressional Research Service report.

That would mean the MRAPs had a total weight of at least 60 tons, which is within the jet’s specifications, according to Boeing.

If the takeoff had been rougher than usual, “it could have caused the cargo in the back of the plane to become loose,” Rosenberg said. If that happened, and the cargo slid to the rear of the plane, it could have left the plane with an improper weight and balance, he said.

He compared that situation with what happens when a heavy person and a light person get on either end of a seesaw. “The light person is never going to get the heavy person off the ground,” he said.

In the case of cargo that was not properly placed or secured, “You’ve got a big, heavy person at the end of the airplane, which outweighs the flight control’s capacity to override that weight.”

Rosenberg’s law firm specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes. He does not have direct knowledge from the investigation.

The critical role of the loadmaster in such flights was outlined in a posting published last month on Bagram’s website.

“When you are a pilot flying a C-130 Hercules over potentially hostile territory, the last thing you need to worry about is whether your cargo is secure,” it says. “That’s why each sortie the 774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron flies includes two loadmasters.”

They are responsible for checking all the systems in the rear of the aircraft and overseeing the loading of the cargo, then making sure it stays that way, it says.

“Upon takeoff, we’ll be looking back at the cargo until we get off the ground, making sure none of the chains break or pop out,” Airman 1st Class Michael Brown says in the airfield’s story. “If they do, we let the pilots know… and we taxi back.”

“There’s a lot of trust that we put in our loadmasters,” said Capt. Kenneth Pedersen, 774th EAS aircraft commander, in the same story. “They’re pretty autonomous … making sure the cargo is secure and loaded correctly.”

Other possible contributors to the crash include malfunction of the flaps on the wings, or some other flight-control system or even a massive loss of power, Rosenberg said.

But Rosenberg said he considered the last possibility to be the least likely, given the redundancy built into the four-engine jet. “It’s a fantastic plane,” he said.

The video leaves no doubt that, whatever the cause, the plane wound up flying too slow to generate sufficient lift on the wings to keep the airplane aloft, he said.

“In all my years of being involved in aerospace and piloting and litigation, I have never, ever, ever seen such a dramatic crash sequence as this one,” he said. “It really is nauseating to look at, a monster like that falling out of the sky. That’s not supposed to happen.”

Rosenberg predicted that the cockpit voice recorder and digital data recorder will provide investigators with the answers to the questions they are asking.

In its statement, National Air Cargo said it “will not speculate as to the cause of the accident,” and that it was fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.",Q1

Holmes is charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other offenses in the July 20, 2012, theater massacre in Aurora. Fifty-eight other people were wounded.

He is scheduled to go on trial Aug. 5.

Last week his attorneys disclosed in a court filing Holmes offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life without parole. Prosecutors said Holmes failed to meet their requirements for a deal.

In their filing, Holmes' attorneys said they may pursue a mental-health defense and file numerous pre-trial motions if the case goes to trial, the Post reported.

Judge to ask Perry for interim prosecutor

KAUFMAN, Texas, April 1 (UPI) -- Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood said he will ask Texas Gov. Rick Perry to name an interim prosecutor following the slaying of District Attorney Mike McLelland.

Even though investigators haven't found any physical evidence linking the Saturday deaths of McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, with the Jan. 31 slaying of Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was shot and killed in a parking lot, Wood said Monday he believed the two incidents were related, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

""There has to be a connection, in my way of thinking,"" Wood said.

Security was enhanced at the Kaufman County Courthouse and the district attorney's office was closed Monday as authorities searched for suspects.

Sheriff David Byrnes said he won't link the deaths of the McLellands to Hasse's slaying, the Star-Telegram reported Sunday.

Deputies were called to the district attorney's home Saturday evening by a law enforcement friend who had stopped by to check on them, WFAA-TV, Dallas, said. Investigators told reporters the front door was open and the McLellands were found shot with what is believed to be an assault rifle.

36 bodies found in Tibet slide; 47 missing

LHASA, Tibet, April 1 (UPI) -- The death toll from a massive landslide in Tibet rose to 36 Monday and it was unlikely survivors would be found among 47 people still missing, officials said.

More than 4,500 rescuers were at the site in a gold mining area where the slide overwhelmed a Jiama Copper Polymetallic Mine worker's camp near the Tibetan capital of Lhasa Friday, burying 83 workers, Xinhua reported.

Officials at rescue headquarters said it was unlikely any survivor would be found, China Daily reported.

About 2 million cubic meters (2.6 million cubic yards) of debris and mud from a mountain fell on the site in Zhaxigang village, authorities said. The thickness of the debris is about 30 meters (about 98 feet), rescuers said.

""It's very difficult to find the trapped people because the volume of dirt and stones is too big,"" one safety official told China Daily. ""The power of the landslide was so great.""

Gunmen destroy NATO trucks; 1 person hurt

QUETTA, Pakistan, April 1 (UPI) -- Five NATO trucks carrying equipment out of Afghanistan were destroyed in a fiery attack in Pakistan Monday but only one injury was reported, officials said.

Four gunmen on motorbikes fired on the trucks as they traveled through southwest Pakistan, then poured gasoline on the vehicles and set them on fire, senior government official Iftikhar Bugti said.

One driver was slightly injured, Geo News reported.

The convoy was attacked in the Bolan district of Balochistan province, about 75 miles southeast of the provincial capital of Quetta.

Afghans secure the area near burnt military vehicles after a clash between Taliban and Afghan security forces in Torkham in Nangarhar province yesterday.



AFP/Kabul





Taliban suicide bombers and gunmen dressed as Afghan police yesterday attacked a US base near the Pakistani border, sparking a shootout that left all three assailants dead, officials said.

No member of the US-led Nato mission in Afghanistan was killed in the assault on the base in Nangarhar province, said a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).

“There were a series of explosions that occurred in the vicinity of a forward operating base in Nangarhar province,” said an ISAF spokesman.

The military later described it as an “attempted but unsuccessful coordinated attack by enemy forces”.

“There were three enemy forces killed during the attack. We can confirm that no ISAF personnel were killed as a result of this incident,” it said in a statement.

An AFP photographer saw the bodies of three dead attackers wearing Afghan police uniforms.

Nato combat troops are gradually withdrawing from Afghanistan and are due to finish their mission completely by the end of 2014, after presidential elections next April.

Afghan officials said yesterday’s attack took place at Torkham, which borders Pakistan and straddles a key Nato overland supply route into landlocked Afghanistan from the nearest sea port of Karachi.

Ahmad Zia Abdulzai, Nangarhar governor’s spokesman, said insurgents first attacked Nato supply trucks. “Today morning, Taliban insurgents attacked and burned supply trucks delivering supplies to Nato which belonged to foreign forces near the US base in Torkham,” he told AFP.

“Later, three armed suicide bombers started gunfire and clashes with Afghan forces and US forces, and they were killed after three hours of fighting. At the moment, the stand-off is over, and the situation is under control.”

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban which is leading a 12-year insurgency against Western troops and the Afghan government, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement sent to the media.

The Taliban have launched a spate of attacks across the country in recent days, with scores killed in suicide bombings, ambushes and rocket attacks. They also killed five aid workers in the west.

On Sunday, the bullet-riddled bodies of seven civilians kidnapped one week earlier by the Taliban were found in Ghazni province just south of the capital.

Also on Sunday, Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan and potential candidate for next year’s presidential election, Omar Daudzai, was appointed acting interior minister.

President Hamid Karzai, who has led Afghanistan since the 2001 US-led invasion removed the Taliban from power, is barred from standing for a third term. He has said he will not back anyone in the April 5 vote, but Daudzai is seen as one of his closest associates and loyalists.

Daudzai, 55, from the biggest ethnic group the Pashtuns, was a member of the Hezb-e-Islami faction during the Soviet occupation and later went on to work for the UN.

Afghanistan’s 350,000-strong security forces are suffering a steep rise in attacks as the Nato mission winds down, with police and army casualties said to have increased by between 15% and 20% since 2011.

The election to succeed Karzai is seen as the key test of whether 12 years of massive international military and aid intervention has been worthwhile.

Karzai recently named controversial former warlord Abdul Rab Rasul Sayyaf, 2009 runner-up Abdullah Abdullah and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani as possible candidates.

Karzai has pledged to ensure a smooth election, but international donors have expressed concern about whether the vote will produce a credible result after the 2009 poll was marred by massive fraud.



Police deaths double as foreign troops withdraw



Police deaths in Afghanistan have doubled this year after withdrawing US-led forces handed security of the war-ravaged country to poorly equipped local troops with less frontline experience fighting Taliban insurgents.

Almost twelve years after coalition forces invaded Afghanistan, swathes of territory are firmly under Taliban control and Afghan troops are still heavily reliant on foreign air support, particularly in remote areas. Their lighter vehicles make them particularly vulnerable to roadside bombs, Reuters reports from Kabul.

The Afghan government, anxious not to damage morale, has been reluctant to publish regular casualty numbers. It no longer publishes death tolls for the army.

Interior Ministry figures published yesterday showed 1,792 police have been killed since March, most of them by roadside bombs, the same number who died in the preceding 12 months, according to data published yesterday.

It is one of the highest police death rates in the world and raises further questions over how the government will be able to keep the Taliban at bay once foreign troops have withdrawn fully from Afghanistan at the end of 2014.

“Afghan police are not as well equipped as foreign troops,” interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told Reuters. “Afghan police forces are in the first line of defence and more exposed to insurgents’ attacks.”

Stressing against any external military intervention in Syria’s affairs,Khurshid said: “We are encouraged by the current proposal,steered by Russia,that is aimed at bringing the Syrian chemical stockpile under international control.

“This proposal is in alignment with India’s own consistent stance of supporting the complete destruction and elimination of chemical weapons worldwide.”

India sees any move in this direction,”within the framework of the UN,as a positive development”,he said.

“We are hopeful that this development will reinvigorate the peace efforts towards a political solution to the Syrian conflict,including the early holding of the proposed International Conference on Syria (Geneva-II),bringing all parties to the conflict to the negotiating table,” he added.

SUBJECT: MUSHARRAF TELLS BOUCHER ABOUT PAKISTAN'S PLANS FOR

BORDER SECURITY

Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

1. (S) Summary and introduction: In his January 12 meeting with Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Richard Boucher, Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf spoke of irritants in Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan and Pakistan's tactical adjustments to enhance security in the border region. Musharraf described tougher procedures for border crossing, selective fencing and mining of the border region, stronger leadership for local police and plans to close Afghan refugee camps. He also underscored that tribal leaders in North Waziristan have been given a month to improve implementation of the September 2006 agreement or face possible military action. Boucher and Lieutenant General Eikenberry briefed the President on their impression of Afghanistan's readiness to face a strong offensive by the Taliban in the spring, noting that President Karzai is a stronger and more confident leader than only a year ago. Boucher reaffirmed U.S. support for Pakistan's development plans for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and offered assistance as the Pakistani and Afghan Jirga Planning Commissions begin to coordinate. Following the 45 minute meeting with the full American delegation reported here, President Musharraf spoke privately for another 45-minutes with Boucher and Ambassador Crocker. End summary.

Afghanistan -- Rhetoric and Bugti

3. (C) President Musharraf decried the heated rhetoric emanating from Afghan officials over the past month. Public accusations that al Qaeda and Taliban figures are operating in our border regions are perhaps understandable, Musharraf said, but it is completely unacceptable for Afghan officials to accuse the Government of Pakistan and Inter Services Intelligence of collusion with the enemy. Warming to his topic, Musharraf described Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz's January 4 visit to Kabul as a bad meeting, saying that President Karzai bombarded the Pakistani delegation with outlandish accusations that Pakistan seeks to enslave the Afghans to achieve strategic depth. This is nonsense, Musharraf concluded; to the contrary, Pakistan wants good relations with the Afghan government and with all communities in Afghanistan. Pakistani officials and diplomats are under his personnel instructions not to interfere in Afghanistan's affairs. Boucher advised the President that U.S. officials have noted the aggravated level of cross-border rhetoric and have counseled Afghan interlocutors not to air their grievance in public. All must appreciate the need to address issues responsibly and, when appropriate, privately.

4. (C) Musharraf told Boucher that militant Baloch nationalist and fugitive Brahamdagh Bugti remains at large in Afghanistan, enjoying freedom of movement to commute between Kabul and Kandahar, raising money and planning operations against Pakistani security forces. Boucher said that he had raised Bugti's presence in Afghanistan with President Karzai, who offered assurances that nobody would be allowed to use Afghanistan as a staging ground for terrorist attacks on Pakistan. Musharraf had a simple response: ""That's bullshit.""

Afghanistan -- Channels of Communication

5. (C) Boucher noted the growth in channels of communication between Kabul and Islamabad, commending the exchange of information that occurs within the military Tripartite Commission and in trilateral intelligence channels. He told his Pakistani hosts that Karzai has agreed to support exchanges between Pakistani and Afghan parliamentarians and encouraged the two countries to seek other opportunities to broaden their relationship. The President agreed, but noted that he was disappointed that the agenda for the January 10 Tripartite Commission plenary session did not address the most critical common challenges facing the two countries: cross-border infiltration, repatriating Afghan refugees and closing camps that have become safe havens for extremists.

Afghanistan -- Better Prepared for Spring Offensive

6. (C) Lieutenant General Eikenberry, who was making farewell calls in Islamabad before relinquishing his command on January 21, shared his impressions of the situation in Afghanistan with Musharraf. Eikenberry told Musharraf that, although the we expect the insurgents to launch a strong offensive in the spring, time is not on the Taliban's side. Afghanistan's security forces -- the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police -- are growing in confidence and capacity. President Karzai is a more confident commander-in-chief and chief executive, replacing corrupt and poor-performing officials. Reconstruction assistance is taking root in districts throughout the country. U.S. forces -- which will reach the highest level of strength in Afghanistan in 2007, despite the inactivation of Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan -- stand ready to give NATO all necessary support to achieve it mission. The current winter lull is the time, Eikenberry continued, to move forcefully to disrupt Taliban command-and-control. A strike to the Haqqani network -- which controls some Taliban action from Pakistan -- would deal a serious blow to both Taliban operational planning and recruitment. Responding to Musharraf's concern that the mil-mil Tripartite Commission is not addressing issues such as refugee repatriation, Eikenberry offered the opinion that the Tripartite Commission operates best when its participants can deal with each other soldier-to-soldier; cross-border issues carrying significant political baggage are better addressed through other channels.

7. (C) President Musharraf suggested that NATO forces could enhance the effort against the Taliban in southern and south-eastern Afghanistan by actively enlisting the support of local populations, even to the extent of arming village-level militias against Taliban insurgents. Boucher described an invigorated effort to boost support for Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police through auxiliary police units of local residents serving under the Ministry of Interior. President Karzai is also responding to public frustration with poor governance and corruption by cleaning out corrupt and dishonest local officials. The international community is using the winter months to inject new flows of development and economic assistance out to the provinces. Musharraf applauded this effort, saying that the Taliban will eventually lose popularity the more it is seen obstructing the country's reconstruction.

Time to Close Refugee Camps

8. (C) President Musharraf advised Boucher that he and his senior advisors have taken several decisions in recent weeks to improve security along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, including closing at least one of the large camps inhabited by Afghan refugees. These camps have become safe havens for militant elements, Musharraf explained. As extensive collateral casualties would inevitably follow any military operation to separate the militants from the civilian residents, the only solution is to begin closing the camps altogether. Musharraf has tasked his advisors with devising a camp closure plan that incorporates recommendations on where the refugees could be relocated if they choose not to return to Afghanistan. These measure will then be discussed with Afghan and UN officials under the auspices of the refugee Tripartite Commission. We agree with you that the camps should close, Boucher replied, underscoring the urgency of devising a plan and coordinating with Afghanistan and the UN before spring.

Stronger Border Security Measures

9. (C) Stressing that Pakistan understands that it must take firm measure to gain control over its western border, Musharraf reviewed a range of actions already under way. New senior police officials appointed to posts in Balochistan and North West Frontier Province have been personally instructed by the President to crack down on undocumented Afghans and other militant targets. The Ministry of Interior is also in the process of lowering the number of official border crossings in Balochistan from 33 to 6. Enhanced immigrations procedures, including biometric crossing cards, have been introduced at the Chaman border crossing, where 30,000 individuals transit daily. The Army has been ordered to design a plan for selective fencing and mining along the border. Musharraf assured Boucher that Pakistan has long and successful experience with mining along its eastern border, and that extraordinary measures would be implemented to prevent accidental civilian casualties or misappropriation of mines by terrorists. Of course, minefields will not stop terrorism, Musharraf said, but they can help us control the insurgents' movements across the border. Boucher noted that deployment of land mines is a complicated issue that the U.S. and other Coalition partners will want to discuss with Pakistani military planners. President Musharraf acknowledged that, but said that these are ""unusual circumstances"" and Pakistan will take ""unilateral measures"" if needed.

Attack on Insurgents Infiltrating from North Waziristan

10. (S) The American delegation briefed the President on the Coalition assault on a massive infiltration of Taliban fighters from North Waziristan on January 10-11. The fighters massed on the Pakistani side of the border before crossing into Afghanistan, where U.S. forces attacked, killing up to 150. Musharraf shared American concern that the enemy could mobilize such a large force during the winter lull, and expressed some frustration that so large a force had been able to collect on Pakistani territory and then cross the border unimpeded. He suggested that this reflected a need for greater aerial surveillance of the area or night-capable helicopter gunships to attack the enemy, indicating his willingness to coordinate with U.S. forces on deploying whatever air assets are necessary to identify and destroy these enemy movements. (Note: The President was specific in calling for reliance on air assets, saying point blank that ground forces are not an option. End note.)

Re-Assessing the North Waziristan Accord

11. (S) Musharraf briefed Boucher on the government's recent review of the September 2006 North Waziristan agreement. Governor Orakzai convened the jirga that negotiated the agreement in December, dispatching the members to Miran Shah to make clear to North Waziristan's tribal leaders that they must take action to prevent cross-border infiltration in support of the Taliban, eliminate foreign fighters from the Agency and stop any effort to establish a parallel political administration. Tribal leaders were given one month to gain control of the situation or the government would consider taking military action. Musharraf refused to be disheartened, saying that it will take time for the accord to take hold. In the interim, the government has stepped up recruitment and training for tribal levies and has assigned a Frontier Corps wing to the Political Agent. This will give the Political Agent the muscle he needs to enforce the writ of state, while the Army will be at hand to take on Taliban and al Qaeda targets.

Pak-Afghan Jirgas

12. (C) Boucher commended Musharraf for naming strong leaders to Pakistan's Jirga Planning Commission, encouraging the Commission to meet soonest with its Afghan counterpart to discuss each country's vision for the process. Noting that he would discuss the jirgas with Interior Minister and Jirga Commission Chair Sherpao later in the day, Boucher told the President that the U.S. stands ready to support the process once Pakistan and Afghanistan determine what assistance will be required.

Federally Administered Tribal Areas Development Assistance

13. (C) Musharraf also spoke plans for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas Secretariat and Development Authority to funnel near-term development assistance through tribal maliks, to strengthen their stature within their tribes. Asking maliks to identify development needs and direct resources will reinforce his authority with the local population, said Musharraf. Boucher replied that the U.S. hopes to offer substantial financial support for the Pakistani's Federally Administered Tribal Areas Sustainable Development Plan.

14. (U) This cable has been cleared by SCA Senior Advisor Caitlin Hayden.

http://www.dawn.com/news/1056504/afghan-suicide-bomber-arrested-near-islamabad,Afghan suicide bomber arrested near Islamabad,"ISLAMABAD: An Afghan man said to be on a suicide mission was arrested here on Thursday after a brief encounter with security personnel in the suburbs of the federal capital.

According to sources, Matiullah had arrived from Afghanistan via Torkham a few days ago and stayed at a house in Tarnol area. He was reported to be wearing jacket stuffed with about five kilograms of explosives and was planning to attack a 9th Muharram procession near Asna Ashari Imambargah at G-6/2.

The sources said the bomber had been arrested on information provided by an alleged Afghan agent detained by a team of security forces and capital police. Syed Mohammad Abdullah told interrogators that he had brought the bomber from Torkham for attacking the procession.

When security personnel raided the house in Tarnol, Matiullah opened fire at them and tired to escape.

The sources said Abdullah used to work for an Afghan intelligence agency. He had also spied for the French Embassy in Islamabad from 1996 to 2010.

He had been arrested by Khasadars in Khyber Agency in December 2010 when his movement in Wazir Dhand aroused suspicion.

Abdullah was handed over to a joint investigation team comprising officials of the ISI, Intelligence Bureau and police. The report submitted by the team said that he had been involved in spying against Pakistan.

The report said that two cases, one relating to a murder attempt, had been registered against him in the Margalla police station in 2010.

During interrogation Abdullah admitted to have come to Pakistan in late 1970s after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and managed to get an identity card. During his stay here he worked for foreign embassies on different missions, including spying for them.

The report graded him as ‘Black’ — a person found guilty. It described him as “a cunning and devious person who could do anything to harm the integrity of Pakistan for his interest”.

On the basis of the report and after proceedings of a jirga, the political agent of Khyber Agency jailed him for three and seven years on different charges and fined him Rs100,000.

The political agent directed the National Database and Registration Authority to cancel his ID card and take action against people who had helped him to get it.

It is not known how and when he was freed and how he managed to enter Pakistan on Oct 27 this year on a visa (38941-13) issued on Oct 24 on an Afghan passport (A2007634) issued on Oct 22. The multiple entry visa was for six months.

It may be mentioned that an integrated border management system (IBMS) was installed at the Torkham border last year to prevent entry of terrorists and criminals into Pakistan. The system was linked with Interpol, passport office, Nadra and the Federal Investigation Agency.",Q1
http://newsweekpakistan.com/taliban-claim-mullah-baradar-still-under-arrest/,Taliban Claim Mullah Baradar Still Under Arrest – Newsweek Pakistan,"Pakistan’s Foreign Office denies Afghan militants’ claims, as terrorists taunt Washington over federal government shutdown.

The Taliban on Wednesday claimed Pakistan had failed to free Abdul Ghani Baradar, the former rebel commander whose release was meant to boost Afghanistan’s peace process.

Baradar, often described as the Taliban’s former second-in-command, was supposedly set free last month, according to the Pakistan government, after months of negotiations between the two governments

“However, with great regret, he is still spending days and nights locked up behind bars in worrisome health conditions which are deteriorating by the day,” the Taliban said in a statement on their website.

A senior Taliban member said that Baradar was being held at a house in Karachi run by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan’s leading intelligence agency. “He doesn’t have any freedom, and his family can’t even visit him,” he said. “The Pakistan government says he has health problems which are being treated, and then his family will be able to visit.”

A separate Taliban source alleged that the ISI was trying to “soften up” Baradar so that he would play a role in the Afghan peace process that may benefit Pakistan.

Baradar has been touted by some as an influential Taliban voice who could persuade the militants to end the bloody insurgency they have waged since being ousted from power in 2001.

A security source in Pakistan confirmed Baradar’s house arrest, which will set back efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan as NATO troops withdraw by the end of next year. “He is in protective custody in an ISI house in Karachi, he cannot meet anybody or move anywhere on his own, he needs permission of security officials,” the source said. “He has the freedom of having the food of his own choice, but he is restricted to the safe house.”

Pakistan’s Foreign Office, in a statement, denied these claims. “Pakistan has released Taliban detainees to facilitate the reconciliation process in Afghanistan,” it said. “Mullah Baradar has been similarly freed.” The former Al Qaeda chief is “free to meet and contact anyone to advance the cause of reconciliation,” it added.

The Afghan government has long demanded that Pakistan free Baradar, who was arrested in Karachi in 2010. At the time of his detention, Baradar was reported to have been the right hand man of the supreme commander Mullah Omar. But some analysts say he has lost influence with the current Taliban high command and would have little effect on the current peace efforts.

Also on Wednesday, the Taliban taunted Washington over the American government shutdown, accusing U.S. politicians of “sucking the blood of their own people.”

The Islamist militants issued a statement describing how U.S. institutions were “paralyzed,” the Statue of Liberty was closed and a fall in tourist numbers had hit shops, restaurants and hotels in the capital. “The American people should realize that their politicians play with their destinies as well as the destinies of other oppressed nations for the sake of their personal vested interests,” the Taliban said.

The insurgents accused “selfish and empty-minded American leaders” of taking U.S. citizens’ money “earned with great difficulty” and then “lavishly spending the same money in shedding the blood of the innocent and oppressed people.”

“Instead of sucking the blood of their own people … this money should be utilized for the sake of peace,” they added.

The U.S. embassy in Kabul has said that it expects “to function normally in the short term” due to the shutdown, though its Twitter feed would not be regularly updated.

Embassy press staff was not immediately available to comment on the rebels’ statement.

The U.S. shutdown has seen hundreds of thousands of workers sent home without pay after Congress failed to pass a budget for the 2014 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.",Q1

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-shank/academic-freedom-in-turke_b_4419392.html,Academic Freedom in Turkey Under Seige,"It appears that Fethullah Gülen, a U.S.-based Islamic preacher from Turkey who promotes peace and tolerance, and the schools associated with his religious Hizmet movement can't get a break.

They were first targeted in America, via discrimination aimed at the Turkish American community centered on his educational efforts, which was initially identified in the Center for American Progress' report ""Fear Inc: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America."" The report found a well-financed, well-organized network of advocates, experts and media partners conducting a strategic campaign throughout America and ""spreading hate and misinformation,"" as CAP put it.

The new supposed Turkish threat to America: ""Muslim Gülen schools, which [members of the Islamophobia network] claim would educate children through the lens of Islam and teach them to hate Americans.""

Advertisement

The authors of the CAP report flatly reject this assertion, however, saying that the schools started by Gülen are ""nothing of the sort"" and that ""they are a product of moderate Turkish Muslim educators who want a 'blend of religious faith and largely western curriculum.'"" Indeed, two Gülen charter schools ranked fifth and sixth on Newsweek's 2011 ""Top Ten Miracle High Schools"" and two Gülen schools ranked 144th and 165th on Newsweek's 2011 list of ""America's 500 Best High Schools."" Clearly, they were doing something right.

Now, Gülen's schools are being targeted in his home country by the Turkish government's ruling Justice and Development Party, known as the AKP, which should dispel any notion in the U.S. that the AKP is somehow in cahoots with the Gülen movement.

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan recently announced a plan to shut down private prep schools, many of which are run by the Gülen movement. Erdogan's draft legislation would abolish the fee-based private preparatory courses for college or high school admission exams and the free private tutoring centers. In doing so, the prime minister said Turkey ""will be putting an end to under-the-counter education"" and that ""this business which takes place in apartment flats needs to stop."" To show his commitment to this crackdown, Erdogan even expelled a dissenting parliamentarian who took issue with his plan.

Advertisement

Speculations are that this is really about who will rule the country going forward, as Erdogan is perhaps keen to undermine Gülen and his, as Reuters noted, ""global network of schools over the past four decades promoting Turkish language and culture"" and its ""powerful movement whose members hold influential positions across Turkish society, from the police and judiciary to the central bank, political parties and media."" To put this ""threat"" in perspective, keep in mind that Gülen talks of peace and tolerance and was compared by Georgetown professor John Esposito to the Dalai Lama and praised by Madeleine Albright and James Baker III for his advocacy of democracy and dialogue.

Erdogan's move was immediately criticized. The former director of the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning from 2006-2010, Mark Bray, said that the government should work to deemphasize the weight of the centralized exam instead of attempting to abolish prep schools. Ersan Sen, a law professor at Istanbul University, added, ""In a representative democracy, the parliament should not abolish prep schools with legislation that does not serve a public need and has no legal foundation.""

The critics are onto something, as there are some serious concerns with Erdogan's proposed move. Conservatives and liberals alike feel that this is another step in government's increasing proclivity to control and micro-manage civic and private life and demonstrate disregard for democratic values such as the participatory process. But there are more reasons to be alarmed.

Advertisement

First, eliminating education services operating within the law and providing a much-needed service to parents voluntarily sending their children should be cause for concern. Any government attempt to monopolize the provision of educational services, and thus suppress an important component of the civil society, is equally disconcerting. And if the legislation passes, expect greater inequality and lack of opportunity for the children of low-income families.

Second, closing free tutoring centers limits opportunities for low-income Turkish youth to pursue education that can lead to an actual career. This is what socio-economic mobility and development looks like. Keep in mind that some of these tutoring centers serve youth who are targets of violent insurgent recruitment in east and southeast Turkey. Integrating and educating these youth is a far better option than disenfranchising them further, a reality to which Erdogan's schools closures will inevitably contribute.

Third, undermining the resolutions of the European Human Rights Court, of which Turkey is a member -- especially the freedoms of expression, freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the protection of property -- shouldn't be tolerated. This clear crackdown on Gülen and Hizmet participants -- who have never endorsed a political party and who have only praised the government's latest democratization package and even supported, in true inter-religiously tolerant fashion, the re-opening of a Greek Orthodox seminary (which the government opposed) -- demands a second look by the international community.

Zardari, the patron-in-chief of the main opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP), told the BBC that Pakistan must ""wake up"" to the threat posed by militancy

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan – Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of Pakistan’s assassinated premier Benazir Bhutto, has urged military action against the Taliban as the country debates how to respond to a surge in militant attacks.

Zardari, the patron-in-chief of the main opposition Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), told the BBC that Pakistan must “wake up” to the threat posed by militancy.

Pakistan, battling a homegrown Taliban insurgency since 2007, has endured a bloody start to the year with 110 people killed in attacks in January, according to an Agence France-Presse tally.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government has been under fire for failing to make a strong response to the upsurge in violence.

The government has for months said it favoured talks with the Taliban but Zardari, 25, said he would only be willing to negotiate terms for the militants’ surrender.

“I think we’ve exhausted the option of talks. Dialogue is always an option but we have to have a position of strength,” he told the BBC.

“How do you talk from a position of strength? You have to beat them on the battlefield. They’re fighting us.”

Ministers held talks on Monday, January 27, to discuss how to deal with the growing militant threat, nearly a week after air force jets bombarded suspected Taliban hideouts in North Waziristan tribal district.

North Waziristan is a major stronghold for groups linked to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and debate is raging about whether a full-scale military ground offensive should be launched to rid the area of militants once and for all.

The United States has long pressured Pakistan to do more to wipe out militant strongholds, saying insurgents were using rear bases in North Waziristan to mount attacks on US troops in Afghanistan.

US Marines observe an area from a school building during a patrol at a village in the Golestan district of Farah province, May 1, 2009. (Reuters/Goran Tomasevic)



Gunshots shook 20-year-old Jan Agha awake. They woke his father, too. But when the older man pulled aside a curtain to see what was going on in his home, he was shot in the throat and face. Jan Agha lay motionless on the floor, pretending to be dead. Like his father, his mother, brother and sister had all been killed.

The full details of the March 11, 2012, massacre in the district of Panjwai, Kandahar Province, may never be known, but the basic story is well established: sixteen Afghan civilians, many of them women and children, were killed and another six injured as US Army Staff Sgt. Robe 1rt Bales stalked from house to house, shooting and stabbing his victims.

By the end of that month, the United States had offered the victims compensation. In a country where the average annual income is about $425, the families of those killed in Panjwai received $50,000 for each of their dead relatives, while injured survivors were given about $11,000. The Afghans were reportedly told the money was assistance provided by President Obama.

The outsized reparations offered in the wake of that horrific mass murder stand in stark contrast to the compensation offered to most Afghans who have suffered as a result of the US war. A much more typical case occurred on March 27, 2009, when an American unit on patrol in Kunar Province, traveling in a convoy, rolled through the village of Bar Kanday. There, the lead vehicle clipped a 3-year-old girl who was crossing the street, “causing serious injury to her left arm,” according to military documents. The girl’s father received the equivalent of $392.16.

The incident in Bar Kanday is one of hundreds of cases of deaths, injuries and property damage recorded in a 1,000-plus-page archive of US military reparations documents obtained by The Nation through the Freedom of Information Act. The records offer a glimpse of the everyday suffering of Afghan civilians caught in the path of war and the means by which the US military has endeavored to make amends.

The files, produced between 2008 and 2011 and released by the US Central Command, were redacted by military censors, who excised almost all names and much of the descriptive information. The collection of “payment request forms” and pay vouchers is neither inclusive nor comprehensive—most of the documents cover only a handful of US units and a few discrete areas of Kunar Province with any depth.

There is also no way to ascertain the percentage of total compensation payments these documents represent. “Solatium” (from the Latin word for “solace”) is defined by the military as “monetary compensation given in areas where it is culturally appropriate to alleviate grief, suffering, and anxiety resulting from injuries, death, and property loss with a monetary payment.” The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) keeps no comprehensive records on payments made for “damage to property, compensation or condolence,” according to a military spokesman. “As a consequence,” he told The Nation, “there is no ‘total dollar amount’ maintained by either [the ISAF Joint Command] or ISAF.” Popular ""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe → How the “Subversive Genius” of Kendrick Lamar Sent Trump Home a Loser How the “Subversive Genius” of Kendrick Lamar Sent Trump Home a Loser Dave Zirin The Making and Remaking of Karl Marx’s “Capital” The Making and Remaking of Karl Marx’s “Capital” Books & the Arts / Alyssa Battistoni Trump Doesn’t Have the Authority.

Even if coalition forces comprehensively tracked payments, such data would reflect the compensation eventually awarded only to that fraction of Afghans who managed to overcome language and cultural barriers, and who lived near a coalition base and had the means to lodge a complaint. As a major Pentagon study of civilian casualties obtained by The Nation noted, the “lack of consistent policies and procedures among nations and even specific units” meant that “processes and designated locations for seeking compensation were not always clear to the Afghan population, so locals did not necessarily pursue compensation when appropriate.”

Afghanistan’s former ambassador to the United States, Said Jawad, said there was really “no system for compensation. If someone is killed near a PRT [provincial reconstruction team] office or close to a military base, they go there,” he told The Nation. “But if there’s a drive-by shooting on the Kandahar-to-Kabul road, in a remote area, who knows whose troops were responsible? People will go to the local PRT or to the local military, and maybe it’s troops from New Zealand or Canada, and they say, ‘It wasn’t us.’ And nothing happens.” (For the record, New Zealand withdrew its forces from Afghanistan earlier this year.)

Money as a Weapon of War



Gen. John “Black Jack” Pershing pushed for adopting a system to pay claims to French civilians during World War I, and the US military in World War II found that paying compensation for harm to civilians “had a pronounced stabilizing effect.” But the modern military reparations system dates to the 1960s. During the Vietnam War, solatia payments were a means for the military to make reparations for Vietnamese civilian injuries or deaths caused by US operations without having to admit guilt. According to Spec. Michael Erard, who coordinated solatia payments for units of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, it “was a condolence-type payment…. It in no way implied or implicated us as the perpetrators of this. So we would pay them a certain amount of money for people lost.” In 1968, the going rate for adult lives was $33. Children merited just half that.

Today, Afghans can receive as much as several thousand dollars for relatives killed by coalition forces and lesser sums for everything from the destruction of homes to the wounding of livestock, via a complicated reparations system in which multiple funding mechanisms are used. But, as in Vietnam, the United States still denies responsibility.

Money as a Weapon System—Afghanistan, a frankly titled 252-page guidebook for US commanders, spells out just how US forces can make payments through the Commanders Emergency Response Program for what are called “condolence and battle damage payments.” According to the 2012 manual, CERP funds are “authorized to be used for payments to individuals in case of death, injury, or battle damage caused by US or coalition military operations,” such as a military vehicle running down a bicyclist during a combat operation in a village. If, however, a vehicle hits a bicyclist during routine travel through a market, victims must file a claim with US representatives under the Foreign Claims Act. Money as a Weapon System goes on to state:

Condolence payments are different from claims and are not an admission of fault by the USG [US government]. It is crucial to remember that when a Commander uses CERP funds, it is not an acknowledgement of any moral or legal responsibility for someone’s death, injury, or damaged property. Condolence payments are symbolic gestures and are not paid to compensate someone for a loss.

Money as a Weapon System also states unequivocally that “CERP condolence payments are not Solatia payments and will not be referred to as such. Solatia payments are made for non-combatant civilian casualties, and come from unit OMA [operation and maintenance] funds as an expression of sympathy and do not necessarily derive from legal responsibility.” The meaning of “non-combatant civilian” is confusing since civilians are, by nature, noncombatants, and if the phrase refers to civilians not wounded in combat, it is not supported by the Army’s official regulations governing solatia payments. These, in fact, make no distinctions between combat and noncombat actions, noting only that, as per local custom, “an individual involved in an incident in which another is injured or killed or property is damaged may, in accordance with local custom, pay solatia to a victim, the victim’s family or another person authorized by the victim (such as a tribal leader) without regard to liability.” Documents examined by The Nation suggest that, in the absence of clear rules about various forms of compensation, military units made up their own on a case-by-case basis.

The compensation records obtained by The Nation contain solatia payments, CERP project reports and other documents, but no breakdowns of the types of payments or tallies of the funds paid out. According to the Government Accountability Office, the Pentagon disbursed more than $30 million in condolence payments in Afghanistan and, mainly, Iraq from 2003 through 2006. In 2006, the United States paid out just over $352,000 in solatia and condolence payments in Afghanistan. In response to a request for a complete accounting of yearly solatia payments, military spokesman David Lakin told The Nation that the United States paid out more than $3.7 million in “battle damage repair” to Afghans in 2010. In 2011, that number jumped to nearly $12 million. Lakin did not respond to repeated requests for clarification about the nature of the payments, what types of incidents warranted compensation, and why the payouts tripled in just a year’s time. When The Nation requested figures for 2012 from ISAF headquarters, the spokeswoman, Maj. Lori Hodge, said that available figures were muddled. “I could wade through the numbers to the best of my ability but my numbers would be a guess and most likely inaccurate,” she wrote in an e-mail.

Paying for Pain and Suffering

Although the reparations records fail to capture the scale of human suffering in Afghanistan, they do paint a vivid portrait of the impact of the war on civilians. One 2008 solatia payment request form chronicles a typical example. In the early morning hours of July 17, a US combat outpost in Kunar’s Pesch River Valley came under attack from Saifullah Minah, a village near the base. Troops replied with mortar fire, which slammed into a home, killing a girl, about 12, and her mother, 35. By the time soldiers arrived on the scene, both had been prepared for burial. The Americans agreed to pay the husband/father $3,000 in compensation.

Three days later, another unit received enemy fire from the villages of Matin and Shouryak and responded with four ground-launched missiles. The results of the US counterattack were catastrophic: one civilian dead, fourteen wounded, fifteen homes damaged and thirty-one animals slain. The victims and families received $11,070 in compensation.

On April 4, 2009, members of one US unit decided to test-fire an automatic grenade launcher, lobbing several grenades over a ridge line, which caused serious injury to a 13-year-old boy out collecting firewood. For his pain and suffering, the Americans paid 20,000 afghanis—about $400.

In Paktika Province near a forward operating base, a motorcyclist approached a military convoy and “failed to adhere to verbal warnings and hand and arm signal warnings to stay away,” according to US documents. The man then left his motorbike, walked to the center of the road and knelt down to pray. When he rose, he approached the convoy, causing the Americans to fear he was a suicide bomber; they again issued verbal warnings and hand signals. When that failed to stop him, a gunner fired two pistol shots at the man. As he lay bleeding, the troops came to the conclusion that he was not carrying a bomb and attempted to render first aid. Within minutes, however, he was dead.

Restrepo Revisited



Kunar Province’s remote Korengal Valley achieved some fame in the United States because of the 2010 documentary Restrepo and its companion book, Sebastian Junger’s War. Through both, the American public was offered a vivid view of what life was like for US soldiers serving on tiny firebases and combat outposts in the foothills of the Hindu Kush. What Junger and his reporting partner, the late Tim Hetherington, largely neglected, however, was what life was like for civilians living near heavily armed Americans who, as the film and book chronicle, often unleashed copious amounts of firepower in the tiny valley.

Solatia documents from the spring of 2009, about a year after Junger and Hetherington left the region, catalog the destruction visited on civilians. Although the documents contain only that fraction of cases that civilians managed to report and for which the Americans agreed to pay compensation, the records provide ample evidence of incidents in which US troops damaged property, slew or injured livestock, and wounded or killed villagers.

On April 3, for example, three bundles from a supply airdrop that was supposed to land at the US outpost missed the drop zone. One struck a home in the village of Babeyal, damaging the roof. Responding to an ambush between the villages of Aliabad and Laneyal on April 15, US troops responded with small arms, missiles and mortars, as well as three 500-pound bombs, killing four goats and damaging a truck. On April 23, three outposts came under enemy fire. The Americans replied with mortars and called in air support, killing livestock in Laui Kalay village. Four days later, US troops responded to enemy fire with mortars, damaging a home and injuring two cows. The next day, an American unit on patrol was ambushed in Laneyal. One of the mortar rounds fired to suppress the attack “experienced a failure,” according to the documents, landing in a nearby village, where it damaged several homes.

A voucher created on May 9, 2009, lists a $7,843.13 payment to a Korengal Valley resident in response to a “civilian casualty.” Two days later, Afghan army troops in Aliabad were attacked by insurgents, prompting return fire that caused property damage in Laneyal. On May 17, shrapnel from bombs dropped on a suspected enemy machine-gun nest killed several cows in Siapal village. A day later, US troops called in bombs and mortars on enemy fighters, killing seven goats belonging to local farmers. That same day, artillery fire on a suspected insurgent staging area near Divpat Mountain injured a farmer’s cow. On May 20, fire from one outpost damaged a shop in Aliabad. On May 23, a soldier shot and killed a charging bull belonging to a farmer in Laui Kalay. The next day, troops at one firebase responded to enemy fire with mortars, killing six goats in Kandalay village. And solatia documents dated May 26 chronicle thousands of dollars in payments by that same unit for otherwise unspecified “property damage.”

A Continuum of Suffering

When I asked Marine Col. Roger Turner, who commanded Regimental Combat Team 5 during 2011 and 2012, far from Kunar in southern Helmand Province, about his experience with doling out compensation, he told me about reparations paid in connection with a man who was shot and killed when he failed to respond to warnings upon entering a US base, and another who was wounded in a crossfire between the marines and Taliban fighters, as well as to people whose property was damaged during marine operations. “The affected families appreciate it and expect it, but it must be viewed in a larger context. We have a surplus of good will that has been established by marines doing the right thing over a period of years,” was how he put it. “The people here have endured the Soviet invasion and occupation, abuse by the mujahedeen warlords, brutality of the Taliban and the ISAF intervention. Many of them are now enjoying peace and security for the first time in their lives. Therefore, when these very rare events occurred, the people, elders, Afghan government officials and Afghan security officials viewed it as an anomaly in the larger context.”

Not all Afghans feel that way. Before Turner arrived in Helmand, in March 2010, British troops were stationed there. The night before one patrol, Grenadier Guardsman Daniel Crook had been treated by medics after consuming a “considerable quantity of vodka.” As a result, he’d been relieved of his rifle and left behind at the base, but armed with two grenades and a bayonet, he decided to join his unit. While attempting to catch up with it, Crook encountered 10-year-old Ghulam Nabi, who he later said had pestered him for chocolate. Crook responded by stabbing the boy in the back, leaving Nabi with wounds that would keep him out of school for months. Following the attack, the family was given a small amount of money to cover medical expenses. It wasn’t until August of 2012, after Crook pleaded guilty to attacking the boy at a court-martial, that the British military accepted responsibility and agreed to pay what it called “appropriate compensation…on receipt of medical reports.” The boy’s father, Shah Zada, bitterly told The Guardian that foreign troops were “in Afghanistan to build the country and remove insurgents, not to stab a child.”

A coalition soldier stabbing a young boy may be an anomaly, but the US military’s own records indicate that, in Kunar Province at least, Afghan civilians regularly suffered from coalition operations. And there’s little reason to believe that Kunar is an outlier. One day we may have a fuller picture of the day-to-day toll that the war inflicted on noncombatants. Until then, the reparations files offer a rare glimpse of the suffering endured by Afghan civilians caught in its path.

http://www.nation.com.pk/national/08-Feb-2014/us-senators-for-approval-to-keep-troops-in-afghanistan,US senators for approval to keep troops in Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON - A bipartisan group of senators demanding an end to US military involvement in Afghanistan urged President Barack Obama on Thursday to seek congressional approval if he wants to keep troops there beyond 2014.

The Obama administration is negotiating a bilateral security agreement with Afghan President Hamid Karzai that could keep troops in Afghanistan after the longest war in US history winds down at the end of this year, when the NATO mission ends.

""We are introducing a bipartisan resolution to say before any American soldier, sailor, airman or Marine is committed to stay in Afghanistan after 2014, Congress should vote,"" Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley told reporters. ""Automatic renewal is fine for Netflix and gym memberships, but it isn't the right approach when it comes to war."" Conservative Senator Mike Lee and fellow Republican Senator Rand Paul have also signed on. The resolution does not take sides on keeping troops in Afghanistan, nor does it prevent the US military from attacking Al-Qaeda or gathering intelligence there, Lee noted.

It simply states that ""after more than a decade of war, Congress, and more importantly the American people, need to have a voice in this debate,"" he said.

""The decision to sacrifice American blood and treasure in this conflict should not be made by the White House and the Pentagon alone."" Congressional resolutions are not legally binding, but they can convey a sense of where lawmakers stand on an issue and put some pressure on the administration. The Senate and House of Representatives both introduced similar measures last year, albeit in amendment form, but neither passed the full Congress.

The Afghanistan war, which began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001, has cost more than 2,300 American lives and $600 billion, the resolution states, adding it is time for Afghans to take responsibility for governing themselves.

""This resolution basically says it all: rebuild America, not Afghanistan,"" said Senator Joe Manchin, a Democratic co-sponsor who said Karzai was no Washington ally. ""If military might or money would change that part of the world, we'd have changed it by now,"" Manchin said.

""We haven't been successful.""

The UN Security Council on Thursday extended the mission of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a peacekeeping international force, in Afghanistan, APA reports quoting local media.

In a resolution adopted here on Thursday, the 15-member Council extended the authorization of ISAF until Dec. 31, 2014. The current mandate of ISAF, led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), expires this weekend.

The force was established to operate against insurgents throughout Afghanistan and help strengthen the country's security forces.

Recognizing that an increasing number of the Taliban are reconciling with the Afghan government, rejecting the terrorist ideology of Al-Qaida and its followers, and supporting a peaceful resolution to the continuing conflict in Afghanistan, the council said, however, ""Security remains a serious challenge in Afghanistan and the region.""

The members of the council also stressed the interconnected nature of the challenges facing the country, reaffirming that sustainable progress on security, governance, human rights, rule of law and development as well as the cross-cutting issues of counter-narcotics, anti-corruption and accountability are mutually reinforcing.

The UN body called upon member states to contribute personnel, equipment and other resources to ISAF and to continue to support security, stability and transition in Afghanistan.

http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/836279.shtml,Central Asia's electric ambitions may stall,"Illustration: Liu Rui/GT

The US Department of State released an official statement on December 11, pledging some $15 million worth of financial support to the Central Asia-South Asia electricity transmission and trade project (CASA-1000).



Termed by the US authorities ""a potentially transformative project,"" it aims to establish a cross-border electricity supply scheme allowing both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to sell their energy surpluses to the Afghan and Pakistani neighbors.



Estimated at somewhere between $950 million and $970 million, CASA-1000 has the advantage of basing its future power generation capacity on the existing infrastructure. It also implies the construction of only 750 kilometers of power transmission lines which will, however, have to cross highly unstable patches of land.



Since the signing of the first intergovernmental memorandum in 2007, the project has mustered support from a number of international financial institutions, including the World Bank and some regional development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Islamic Development Bank. Japan and Australia are also actively involved in financing CASA-1000's preparatory activities.



A meeting of the four participating countries in Islamabad in September 2013 further enabled the approval of a common resolution laying out basic principles related to the core commercial and technical aspects of the project. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's special advisor for energy Sartaj Aziz stated at the time that CASA-1000 would be completed in 2017.



Most recently, on December 18, Kyrgyzstan's Deputy Minister of Energy and Industry Aibek Kaliyev said that the Russian government might offer a $500 million loan to Bishkek to help it in carrying out its contractual obligations within the CASA-1000 framework.



While the project has made much progress in the last few months and may be seen as a positive undertaking not only by the four participants but also from the outside, it still has a long way to go.



Earlier in June, the ADB, which had initially planned to provide as much as 40 percent of the overall funding, announced it would withdraw from the project, citing security concerns. As the security situation in Afghanistan and at the Afghan-Pakistan border remains tense, the specter of increased post-2014 violence is now hovering over the whole region. The Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization recently made public its own growing doubts over Central Asia's future stability.



In this context, should attacks against Afghan security forces as well as departing foreign troops and aid workers intensify in the months to come, CASA-1000 may lose some of its prospective donors.



In a context where none of the four member countries is able to shoulder the costs of project implementation, this scenario would deal a mortal blow to Central Asia's incipient cross-border energy grid.



CASA-1000's success is also heavily dependent on the ability of Central Asian states to ensure mutually advantageous cooperation and share the fruits of their respective energy plans.



At present, both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan remain firmly opposed to the implementation of any large-scale hydropower projects by Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, capable of disrupting their water supply systems. Tashkent is particularly worried about the state of its cotton industry employing hundreds of thousands of Uzbeks.



During Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to Uzbekistan in June 2013, the two presidents representing Central Asia's downstream countries insisted on the need to conduct mandatory feasibility studies of all ongoing and future projects, under the strict supervision of international experts. Thus, should Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan wish to expand their power generation capabilities, their efforts will be invariably resisted by the powerful neighbors.



Washington's efforts in Central Asia are thus headed for uncertain, if not tough times. Poor regional coordination and deteriorating security conditions may be equally fatal to the future of another ambitious energy project, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. In either case, this year will prove to be crucial.

http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/07/18/the-2014-olympics-should-the-us-attend/,The 2014 Olympics: Should the US attend?,"South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has made headlines once again for suggesting that the United States boycott the upcoming 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Ever since National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden fled to Moscow, the U.S. has been desperately trying to convince the Russian government to return the 30-year-old American to his home country to be put on trial. Snowden has been charged with espionage for spilling the NSA's secret phone and Internet surveillance programs. He recently requested temporary asylum in Russia, and Putin has yet to make a final decision.

Graham appears to have grown tired with the Russian government’s lack of urgency.

“I love the Olympics but I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world,” Graham told NBC news on Tuesday. “I don’t know if putting the Olympics on the table is the right answer, but I do know this – what we’re doing is not working.”

Ari Melber, co-host of The Cycle, was less than impressed with Graham’s proposal. “This is what this guy does,” Melber said on Wednesday’s show. “He may say this because it plays well back home. But it’s irresponsible as a leader. It’s irresponsible as a senator.”

Fellow msnbc host Steve Kornacki has awarded Speaker of the House John Boehner with a gold medal for being the voice of reason on the question of whether to boycott the upcoming Olympics. “I love Sen. Graham. We’ve been close friends for 20 years,” Boehner told the press on Wednesday. “But I think he’s dead wrong. Listen, why would we want to punish U.S. athletes who have been training for three years to compete in the Olympics over a traitor who can’t find a place to call home?”

Graham has already begun re-tracking his statement. ""I would consider anything to change Russia's behavior,"" Graham said to CNN. ""What I want to do is get people focused on what Russia's doing to the world.""

The United States Olympic Committee also weighed in on the issue. “We strongly oppose the notion that a boycott of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is in our country’s best interests,” said USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky. “If there are any lessons to be learned from the American boycott of 1980, it is that Olympic boycotts do not work.”

The U.S. chose to boycott the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow in response to Russia’s invasion of Afghanistan. In 1936, the U.S. seriously considered boycotting the Olympic Games in Hitler-led Germany, but ultimately decided to participate.",Q1

IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency

Islamabad, July 29, IRNA -- Pakistan will strive to restore strategic dialogue with the United States during the forthcoming visit of Secretary of State John Kerry to Islamabad, the Foreign Ministry said Sunday.

The strategic dialogue between the two countries had been stopped after the US fighter jets bombed a Pakistani post and killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in November 2011.

The last round of talks was held in October 2010 in Washington.

Kerry was originally scheduled to visit Pakistan in June but postponed his visit due to rapidly changing developments over the Syrian crisis.

The Prime Minister’s office said on Friday that John Kerry will visit Islamabad in a few days.

The upcoming visit of the US Secretary of State will be the first high level contact with newly installed government in Pakistan.

Spokesman Foreign Office Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry says five working groups on both sides engaged to move forward the Pakistan-US strategic dialogue before the American attack.

Chaudhry told state radio that these groups will hold meetings for resumption of wide-range strategic dialogue if agreed by both sides.

The United States is Pakistanˈs largest trading partner and the two countries are already cooperating in politics‚ defense‚ trade‚ commerce‚ infrastructure‚ agriculture‚ energy‚ education‚ culture and other areas.

Afghan reconciliation process would be one of the key agenda items in John Kerryˈs visit to Islamabad. Pakistan has assured full commitment to all initiatives designed to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan.

Pakistan has already affirmed its commitment to a strong and cooperative relationship with the United States, Radio Pakistan reported.

GENEVA, July 5 (KUNA) -- The UN high commission of refugees UNHCR on Friday estimates that approximately 8,400 migrants and asylum-seekers landed on the coasts of Italy and Malta in the first six months of this year.

""The majority arrived in Italy (7,800), while Malta received around 600 migrants and asylum-seekers"", said the UNHCR Spokesman Adrian Edwards in a press briefing.

Those making this journey mostly departed from North Africa, principally Libya (around 6,700 people). The remaining 1,700 crossed from Greece and Turkey, landing in southern Italy's Apulia and Calabria regions, he added.

For 2012 as a whole, some 15,000 migrants and asylum-seekers reached Italy and Malta (13,200 and 1,800 respectively) by sea. The number arriving in the first six months of 2012 was 4,500 (3,500 in Italy and 1,000 in Malta).

Edwards explained that ""Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are the main places of origin of these migrants and asylum-seekers, particularly Somalia and Eritrea. Other countries of origin include Egypt, Pakistan and Syria. Nationals of Gambia, Mali and Afghanistan also make these crossings, but in smaller numbers"". According to the UNHCR, the Mediterranean is one of the busiest seaways in the world, as well as a dangerous sea frontier for migrants and asylum seekers en route to southern Europe. In view of the perils UNHCR again calls on all vessels at sea to be on alert for migrants and refugees in need of rescue. We also renew our call to all shipmasters in the Mediterranean to remain vigilant and to carry out their duty of rescuing vessels in distress. International and European law also requires states to ensure that people intercepted or rescued at sea who seek asylum can gain access to territory and to an asylum procedure where their international protection needs or claims can be examined.

""The peak crossing period for migrants and asylum-seekers runs from May to September. At this time of year when there is an increase in the number of people trying to make this perilous journey it is essential to ensure that the long-established tradition of rescue at sea is upheld by all and that international maritime law is adhered to"", Edwards said.

UNHCR has recorded some 40 deaths in the first six months of 2013 by people attempting to cross the Mediterranean between North Africa and Italy. This number is based on interviews conducted with people who reached Europe using boats.

In 2012, almost 500 people were reported dead or missing at sea. The decrease in deaths so far in 2013 is thanks in part to the efforts of the Italian and Maltese authorities, in particular the Italian coastguard and the Maltese armed forces, in effectively coordinating rescue at sea. UNHCR also welcomes the on-going efforts by the authorities in Italy, Malta and Libya to rescue boats in distress in the Mediterranean, and calls on all states to continue to fulfill their obligations under international refugee law and law of the sea.

http://rt.com/usa/suicide-rate-us-army-561/,"Suicide rate among US active-duty troops falls, reservists buck positive trend","The US’s army has seen an almost 20 percent slump in the suicide rate in 2013, believed to be linked to the country’s lesser involvement in wars. However, suicides among those in the National Guard and reserves have still been rising.

A total of 150 confirmed and suspected suicides among active-duty soldiers last year is down from the record-breaking 185 in 2012, when the number of suicides surpassed the number of troops killed in Afghanistan. The 2013 statistics have been provided by the USA Today, citing as-yet-unpublished internal Army data.



The drop is dramatic, considering the suicide rate in the US army had been steeply rising since 2004, with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta having described the trend as “an epidemic.”



""I'm not declaring any kind of victory here,"" Lt. Gen. Howard Bromberg, chief of Army personnel commented on the fresh figures. ""It's looking more promising.""



The US Army has been investing about $50 million a year since 2009 in providing psychological help to soldiers, including those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).



Researchers still mostly link the reversal of the negative trend to US’s curbing its military activity in war zones. The US withdrew its military forces from Iraq in 2011 and has since been in the process of withdrawing from Afghanistan, having vowed to have all of its soldiers out of there by the end of 2014.



In 2012, the worst on record for suicides in the US army, four of five soldiers to take their own lives were whose who had been deployed at least once to Iraq or Afghanistan.



The slump in suicides among soldiers on active duty is however accompanied by an 8 percent rise of the rate among members of the National Guard or reserve. There were 140 suicides in the group in 2012 compared to 151 last year.



Many reservists were also deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Dr. Barbara van Dahlen, a psychologist and founder of Give an Hour, a non-profit organization that provides counseling to soldiers, believes they lack the Army’s help and support.



“Who is keeping track of those in the Guard?” she said as cited by The Los Angeles Times. “It’s a much more dispersed community, and [the Army] doesn’t have the resources to reach all those folks who might be struggling.”



“We are not at the point yet where a Guard member can easily get help,” she added.



Van Dahlen explains, reservists and Guard members are only entitled to counseling and treatment through military programs if they are suffering from trauma they received while on active duty. But those who are eligible often live in rural areas, where assistance is inaccessible.",Q1

http://dawn.com/news/1033166/al-qaeda-taliban-backers-win-us-contracts-in-afghanistan,"Al Qaeda, Taliban backers win US contracts in Afghanistan","WASHINGTON: Supporters of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan have been getting US military contracts, and American officials are citing “due process rights” as a reason not to cancel the agreements, according to an independent agency monitoring spending.

The US Army Suspension and Debarment Office has declined to act in 43 such cases, John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, said on Monday in a letter accompanying a quarterly report to Congress.

“I am deeply troubled that the US military can pursue, attack, and even kill terrorists and their supporters, but that some in the US government believe we cannot prevent these same people from receiving a government contract,” Sopko said.

The 236-page report and Sopko’s summary provide one of the watchdog agency’s most critical appraisals of U.S. performance in helping to build a stable Afghanistan as the Pentagon prepares to withdraw combat troops by the end of next year.

“There appears to be a growing gap between the policy objectives of Washington and the reality of achieving them in Afghanistan, especially when the government must hire and oversee contractors to perform its mission,” said Sopko, whose post was mandated by Congress.

The US has 60,000 troops in Afghanistan, with plans to reduce the number to 34,000 by February. President Obama hasn’t decided how many to keep in the country after next year to train Afghan forces and engage in anti-terrorist missions.

Sopko expressed pessimism that the US can maintain effective oversight of billions of dollars in reconstruction spending as forces are withdrawn. The Obama administration has requested $10.7 billion in such funding for fiscal 2014 to cover projects from improving local government to building roads and schools. “Unless the US government improves its contract-oversight policies and practices, far too much will be wasted,” Sopko wrote.

According to the report, Sopko’s agency “has found it impossible to confirm” the number of contracts awarded in a $32 million programme to install barricades, bars or gratings in culverts at about 2,500 Afghan locations to prevent insurgents from placing roadside bombs. The explosives are the biggest killer of US and Afghan troops.

The policy to create an effective Afghan army, which has 185,287 troops, “will remain hollow unless Washington pays equal attention to proper contracting and procurement activities to sustain those forces,” Sopko said.

He said that he is “well aware of the wartime environment in which contractors are operating in Afghanistan, but this can neither explain the disconnect nor excuse the failure”. As of May 31, the US had committed $30 billion for contracts to build, train and sustain the Afghan army. Sopko said he has witnessed the failings personally during his first year as inspector general, including 50 meetings he and his staff attended during his last trip to Afghanistan.

As of March, 40,315 of the personnel working under Pentagon contracts in Afghanistan, or about 37 per cent, were Afghan locals, according to the report.

Regarding the 43 cases of contractors with militant connections, Sopko said the US army should “enforce the rule of common sense” in its suspension and debarment programme. “They may be enemies of the United States, but that is not enough to keep them from getting government contracts,” according to the agency’s report.

The army’s procurement-fraud branch reviewed the 43 cases late last year, Matthew Bourke, a service spokesman, said in a statement. The reviewers “did not include enough supporting evidence to initiate suspension and debarment under federal acquisition regulations,” he said.

George Wright, another army spokesman, said by email that cutting off the contracts based only on information from Sopko’s office “would fail to meet due-process requirements and would likely be deemed arbitrary if challenged in court”.

Sopko said the US army “appears to believe that suspension or debarment of these individuals and companies would be a violation of their due-process rights if based on classified information” or on Commerce Department reports.

http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/43442/,"‘Article 226 makes it clear that all elections, except for PM and Ms, would be held by secret ballot’","ISLAMABAD (APP): The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday adjourned hearing in a presidential reference seeking opinion on open balloting for the upcoming Senate elections till Thursday.

A five-member larger bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mushir Alam, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi heard the reference.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, while continuing his arguments, said the Constitution did not mention the procedure for the election of NA speaker and deputy speaker and Senate chairman and deputy chairman.

The house officials conducted the elections where the Constitution did not specify the procedure, he said. The outgoing speaker served as returning officer for the election of the next one, he added.

He said the elections whose procedure was stipulated in the Constitution, would be considered under the Constitution.

The Constitution called for the creation of national and provincial assemblies, he added.

Justice Ijaz observed that the court understood the crux of his argument that the Constitution called to form offices and bodies, but the method of their election was in the law not in the Constitution.

The AGP said the offices of national and provincial assemblies were not constituted under the Constitution but under the law. The Constitution provided their composition, but laws and acts had been made for their elections, he added.

He said the duration of the parliament, the modus operandi, the number of sittings, etcetera were stated but the Constitution did not specify the procedure for the elections.

He said only the number of elected representatives was mentioned in the Constitution, but laws and acts were made for their election by the constituents.

The AGP said the number of special seats for women and minority and full composition of the parliament were provided in the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz asked how the elections were held for the women reserved seats.

The AGP replied that women seats were allocated by the winning ratio of the political parties. It was written in the Constitution that the National Assembly (NA) elections were held under the law, he added.

Addressing the AGP, the CJP said according to him (AGP) the NA elections were held by law.

Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan said the Act 2017 called for elections by secret ballot.

The AGP said Article 59 provided the composition of the Senate. The word act was also used for women in the Senate, he added.

He said direct votes and constituencies had been mentioned for the NA but direct elections were not mentioned for the Senate.

Justice Bandial said the formal procedure for the election of NA members was given in the law but not for the Senate.

The AGP said the procedure for Senate elections was different as members of provincial assemblies proposed the candidates for the Senate. Independent candidates could also participate in the Senate elections, he added.

Justice Ijaz said the members of the provincial assemblies should be allowed to exercise their votes freely.

The attorney general said elections of Senate chairman, deputy chairman, prime minister and the chief ministers were not clear in the Election Commission and the Election Act. Article 60 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the Senate chairman, he added.

Justice Ijaz said Articles 53 and 60 of the Constitution did not mention that there would be open ballot elections or secret elections.

The attorney general said the elections of the NA speaker and Senate chairman would be held through secret balloting under the Article 266.

He said it was clear in the Constitution that the outgoing NA speaker would conduct the election of the speaker. The first task of the elected assembly would be the election of the speaker, he added.

He said the elections of the prime minister, NA speaker and Senate chairman were not conducted under the Election Act.

He said the parliament itself conducted the elections of the prime minister, Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.

He said Article 53 of the Constitution mentioned the election of the speaker but Senate and NA elections were not held under the Constitution.

Justice Ijaz said Article 226 made it clear that all elections, except for the prime minister and the chief ministers, would be held by the secret ballot.

The AGP said the chapter on elections held under the law was different.

The Article 226 did not apply to every election, he added.

The chief justice said if Article 226 applied, the elections for reserved seats could not take place.

He said elections for the national and provincial assemblies were held under the law.

The attorney general said all laws were framed in accordance with the Constitution.

He said political parties submit lists for representation on reserved seats.

He said an independent candidate could contest the Senate election if he was nominated and proposed by a member of the provincial assembly.

Justice Ijaz said if any member of the provincial assembly wanted to vote against the party, he should use open balloting.

The attorney general said generally people considered election only on voting day but the election machinery was also part of the voting process. Elections were not just about voting as it had many stages, he added.

He said constituency elections, preparation of voter lists, delimitation, nomination papers, voting schedule, voting and results were all the stages.

The chief justice said those were the stages of direct elections.

The attorney general said whether there was an assembly or not, the president could issue an ordinance related to the elections.

He said the Senate Election Act of 1975 also laid down the procedure for holding Senate elections.

He said elections under the law could not be challenged but only elections held under the statute could be challenged in tribunals.

Justice Ijaz said elections under the law could be challenged under the Constitution.

The attorney general said the vote of an ordinary citizen was free but the vote of a member of provincial assembly (MPA) given to a senator was not free.

When the MPA’s vote for the Senate could not be free, then the ballot could not be secret, he added.

Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan said it was unwise to vote for another senator by secret ballot in violation of party discipline.

The MPA violating party discipline should have moral courage to openly say that he had voted against the party discipline, he added.

Upon this, Justice Bandial said this was moral, not legal. The MPA had the right to vote according to his will, he added.

The chief justice said the courts were the guardians of the Constitution.

Justice Yahya Afridi addressing the AGP said his argument was moral in nature and the matter was political.

He said the question raised in the presidential reference was legal and ethical but the matter was political.

He asked the attorney general that his case was based on ethics while the issue was political.

He asked why the government was seeking the opinion of the court instead of approaching the parliament?

The attorney general said the government had only approached the SC for an opinion.

If the opinion of the SC was in government’s favour, the final decision was to be taken by the parliament, he added.

He said the SC had given its opinion on the NA’s resolution regarding recognizing Bangladesh.

Justice Afridi said the AGP’s argument regarding Bangladesh was correct.

The attorney general said he could give eleven examples of cases in which the court ruled despite the presence of political aspects.

He said the apex court disqualified politicians by interpreting the law in dual citizenship cases.

He said the issue of disclosure of assets of parliamentarians was political but the SC also interpreted the law on it.

The government had come to the SC to stop the sale and purchase of votes and for transparency, he added.

Justice Ijaz asked the AGP whether he was just asking the court to interpret the Article 226 only?

The attorney general responded that he could not put it more simply.",Q1

“If the government is serious about pursuing the dialogue process with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan it should allow them to have their own office like the one opened by the Afghan Taliban in Qatar,” Imran Khan told reporters outside the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar.

“If the Americans can allow the opening of office in Qatar to facilitate talks with the Afghan Taliban, why can’t we do in our own country,” he said.

Mr Khan visited the hospital for the second time since Sunday’s twin suicide attacks on the All Saints Church and met the injured in different wards.

He said he was surprised that while there were prospects of talks with the Taliban, acts of terrorism were continuing. How is it possible to negotiate, he asked, when terror strikes continued unabated.

He said that although the APC had decided to go for negotiations instead of using force, so far no mechanism had been put in place for the dialogue. The government should demonstrate some seriousness and declare a ceasefire to pave the way for result-oriented talks and to establish peace in the country.

Without holding talks with the militants, he said, it would not be possible to end terrorism. He warned that the war against terrorism would continue to haunt the people of the country if his suggestion for a Taliban office was not taken seriously.

People could no more live with terrorism because it halted progress, he added.

“Unfortunately, the church bombing in which innocent people were killed has been politicised by some politicians. It is shameful. We should stand by Christian brethren in these trying times,” he said.

Mr Khan said people wanted peace and for that they had voted for candidates of his party. “We will make every effort to get rid of terrorism so that people can heave a sigh of relief.”

He said that nine years ago there was only one Taliban group but now 35 groups were operating in the country.",Q1
http://wbaa.org/post/special-ops-envisions-iron-man-suit-protect-troops,Special Ops Envisions 'Iron Man'-Like Suit To Protect Troops,"In the Iron Man movie series, Robert Downey Jr. plays a billionaire working with his trusty robot to build a protective suit that will help him battle evil.

Now, the U.S. Special Operations Command is teaming up with industry, universities and laboratories to see if such a suit can be created for the real world of combat.

Adm. Bill McRaven, who unveiled the idea at a conference in May, says it was inspired by the death of one of his troops in Afghanistan.

""One of our folks going through the door was killed by the Taliban on the other side in an attempt to rescue a hostage,"" McRaven, the command's top officer, says.

So McRaven challenged those at the conference to come up with better body armor. And he posed this question: ""Why haven't we put effort into ensuring particularly that guy going through the door ... is protected to the maximum capability that we can provide him, as a nation?""

That effort is now underway. The Special Operations Command held something of a science fair last month in Tampa, says Jim Geurts, who buys high-tech equipment for the command. At the conference, dozens of technologies were shown off, he says, including ""advanced body armor, advance power supply, practical exoskeletons ... [and] different display technologies.""

It's all just a concept now, Geurts says. But it's a concept with a name: TALOS, short for tactical assault light operator suit. It will take a year to even select which technologies to use.

""We're not at the Iron Man flying suit, you know, flying at 50,000 feet level,"" he says.

So, a flying suit is not part of the plan. But the first challenge is to come up with stronger body armor so a commando can survive once he kicks in a door.

Norman Wagner, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Delaware, is working the problem. He's looking to nanotechnology to create a solution that contains particles smaller than a single red blood cell.

""We're starting with the material that's almost a liquid ceramic,"" he says.

A liquid that can be dipped in Kevlar fabric — the current building block of body armor and helmets — and make it even tougher, literally the moment a bullet strikes.

""It transitions when you hit it hard,"" Wagner says. ""These particles organize themselves quickly, locally in a way that they can't flow anymore and they become like a solid.""

So a liquid becomes a solid to make better armor protection. But the military wants to do more. It wants to make the soldier faster and stronger.

Gareth McKinley, a professor at MIT, works on liquid armor, among other things. He says the suit could include attachable frames on the arms and legs that use hydraulics to greatly increase strength and speed.

""They typically consist of an external skeleton that's attached or bolted onto the human's either upper torso or lower torso,"" McKinley says.

Sounds a bit like Iron Man, doesn't it?

""It sounds exactly like Iron Man,"" McKinley says. ""The other kind of things that you see in the movies I think that would be more realistic at the moment would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human.""

Another function: The commandos need a more complete picture of the battlefield.

So, the suit will likely include a wearable computer, like Google Glass, says Geurts of the Special Operations Command. Instead of a handheld display, commandos could simply look into the corner of their glasses and get updates on things like the location of enemy forces.

But, Geurts cautions people not to expect any of this anytime soon,

""The hope is that we would have some working full-up prototypes in the two- to three-year time frame,"" he says.

In the meantime, that kind of suit can only be seen at a theater near you.

Washington : A Somali militant, who was wanted by the US and had a $5 million bounty on his head, has been killed in infighting among members of the Al Qaeda linked group Al-Shabaab, CNN reported.

Ibrahim Al Afghani, a senior member of Al-Shabaab, was killed along with another top member, Moalim Burhan, in a shooting between two factions of the group June 20, spokesman Abu Musab said.

Al Afghani was wanted for terrorism by the US State Department, which offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his location.

A US administration official told CNN that Washington believes the report of his death to be true.

Infighting in Al-Shabaab has been going on between two groups, one loyal to founding member Ahmed Godane and another, smaller faction that supports foreign jihadists in Somalia. It began about a month ago when a member of the smaller group was targeted in a tea shop, allegedly by members from the other side, CNN said.

Al Afghani and Burhan were both members of the smaller faction.

The main Al-Shabaab group denies there is infighting and blames reports of a split on local media.

Musab said the two men were killed when Al-Shabaab fighters tried to arrest them for supporting foreign jihadists and the pair fought back. He said Al Afghani and Burhan were not killed intentionally.

The political and military scrambling reflected the gravity of a crisis triggered by a 20-hour Haqqani assault on the US embassy in Kabul on 13 September, and subsequent US allegations that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency was behind the attack.

On Sunday night militants again attacked the US embassy compound in Kabul. The BBC reported gunfire and an explosion. Reuters said a US government source had acknowledged the building targeted likely contained CIA offices.

Last week the outgoing US military chief, Admiral Mike Mullen, described the Haqqani network as a ""veritable arm"" of the ISI that were being used to fight a ""proxy war"" in Afghanistan.

The bare-knuckles criticism of Pakistan's military, unprecedented since 2001, has plunged already troubled relations between the two countries to a new low and led to widespread anxiety in Pakistan about what is coming next.

US actions will also be driven by domestic political pressure. In a taste of rising impatience with Pakistan, one senior Republican said the US was ""going to have to put all options on the table, including defending our troops"".

""We need to put Pakistan on notice,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the armed services committee, told Fox News.

Analysts say the US will have to take action, but there is little indication what it will be. ""They have to do something; they can't leave it hanging like this,"" said regional analyst Michael Semple.

Speculation is rife. One option would be air strikes or a special forces raid into the Haqqani safehaven of North Waziristan in the tribal belt. But most analysts believe such a scenario is unlikely, at least for now, given the risks of triggering upheaval that could destabilise the Pakistani government, and even lead to a military takeover.

Instead there are suggestions that the US could increase the tempo of CIA-directed drone strikes against the Haqqanis, including on populated urban areas that the CIA has previously avoided.

One likely target would be Miran Shah, the main town in North Waziristan, where US officials complain the Haqqani leadership lives in close proximity to a major Pakistani base.

Pakistan's military admits it has contacts with the Haqqanis but insists they are for the purposes of gathering intelligence, not for priming attacks on US forces in Afghanistan.

""Any intelligence agency would like to maintain contact with whatever opposition group, whatever terrorist organisation … for some positive outcome,"" military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told CNN.

President Asif Ali Zardari's government, meanwhile, finds itself hamstrung by a foreign policy it does not control. Paradoxically, this lack of power could insulate the civilians from a military takeover, said defence analyst Dr Hasan Askari-Rizvi.

""I don't think there will be a coup. The civilian government doesn't get in the military's way, so they have no need to knock them out,"" he said.

Meanwhile other tensions are bubbling along the northeastern part of the Afghan border, away from Waziristan. The Afghan defence ministry has accused Pakistan of firing over 300 artillery shells and rockets into Kunar and Nuristan provinces since Wednesday.

Pakistan says that Pakistani Taliban militants are using the same Afghan territory – recently vacated by US forces - to mount raids into Pakistan.

Behind the angry rhetoric between the US and Pakistan, there is a strong sense that both sides need each other – at least for now. Amid the firestorm of allegations a senior US officer, General James Mattis, paid General Kayani a visit on Saturday.

Prime minister Gilani perhaps put it most succinctly: ""They can't live with us. They can't live without us.""",Q1

http://www.dw.de/hague-warns-scots-no-eu-without-uk/a-17370815,Hague warns secessionist Scots – DW – 01,"The UK foreign minister has warned that an independent Scotland would lose diplomatic clout. Scots vote in a September 18 referendum that could end 307 years of union with England.

Pro independence campaigners in Scotland To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

The union is ""greater than the sum of its parts,"" Hague said in a speech Friday in Glasgow, announcing a UK government analysis of the potential impact of Scottish secession on foreign affairs. The Conservative foreign minister also called unlikely the Scottish government's claim that it could engineer a ""seamless transition"" to full membership in the European Union.

""I feel deeply that what is at stake this year is not only Scotland's future but all our future, because Scotland leaving the United Kingdom would diminish us all,"" Hague said.

Hague warned that European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy have indicated that Scotland would have to reapply for EU membership. He said that should the independent Scotland succeed in rejoining the EU, it may have to adopt the euro as its currency and join the passport-free Schengen zone, which allows for seamless travel between most countries in the bloc - with the exception of the United Kingdom. Independence advocates say they want to keep the pound as the country's currency and remain in the EU and NATO if the country votes to separate.

'Hypocritical Tories'

Voters will make their decision on September 18. Independence would take effect in March 2016.

Scotland's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, rejected Hague's arguments as ""an example of the same old hypocritical Tories lecturing Scotland on why we shouldn't be taking decisions ourselves."" Sturgeon, the second in command to Alex Salmond of the Scottish National Party, added that a proposed referendum on UK's leaving the European Union ""could see Scotland out of the EU even if we vote to stay in.""

""More than ever Scotland needs direct representation in Europe so we can protect and promote Scotland's interests,"" said Sturgeon, who also wrote an open letter to Hague challenging him to answer 12 questions about the analysis he presented on Friday.

Among the country's four main parties, the Scottish National Party has campaigned for independence. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats oppose the measure. Opinion polls show that the independence movement has the support of only a third of voters, but anti-separatist campaigners have warned against complacency as about 15 percent of Scots remain undecided.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/23/guantanamo-bay-obama-administration,Guantánamo detainee release to be restarted as part of Obama plan,"Barack Obama on Thursday moved to restart the release of detainees from Guantánamo Bay in a move designed to defuse an ongoing hunger strike and to take a step towards the president's stated aim of shutting the controversial prison camp.

Giving a major speech on national security, Obama said that any failure to close the prison would be judged by history as having been morally wrong and that he was committed to resolving the problem.

""History will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to end it,"" Obama said. ""Imagine a future – 10 years from now, or 20 years from now – when the United States of America is still holding people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land that is not a part of our country.""

Obama said a series of steps would be taken, including lifting a moratorium on releasing Yemeni prisoners who had already been deemed safe to transfer back to that country. Out of 166 men kept in Guantánamo, 86 have been cleared to leave but American officials have previously cited security concerns in effectively suspending any releases.

Some 56 Yemenis have been cleared for release, including around 30 who can only be transferred back to their native land if certain security requirements are met. The administration has also reportedly been talking to Afghanistan about whether it could offer guarantees that released prisoners would not be a threat.

Officials said that detainees would have their cases dealt with on an individual basis, raising the prospect of a few prisoners being freed from Guantánamo one-by-one in the next few weeks rather than any wholesale transfer.

In a statement, the government of Yemen welcomed the move and pledged to ""ensure the safe return of its detainees and ... their gradual rehabilitation and integration back into society"".

Obama said that he would appoint a senior envoy at the State Department and the Defense Department whose sole responsibility would be to examine ways of transferring detainees to other countries. He had also asked Pentagon officials to come up with another site where military tribunals could take place to prosecute alleged terrorists.

Finally, he said that those detainees who had yet to be charged in those tribunals could be dealt with by the US civilian justice system – as several recent high-profile terrorism cases have been. ""Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and military justice system. And we will insist that judicial review be available for every detainee,"" he said.

However, he admitted that even after all these steps some detainees considered a real threat, or believed guilty of crimes, would likely still be held, perhaps because evidence against them is inadmissable in a court of law. Obama said he was convinced this problem too could be solved, though he offered no path forwards. ""I am confident that this legacy problem can be resolved, consistent with our commitment to the rule of law,"" he said.

Obama's shift represents a remarkable about-face for an administration that had seemed content to ignore the plight of Guantánamo Bay prisoners until they started a hunger strike several months ago. What was at first a limited protest gradually spread to involve more than a hundred detainees, with several dozen being force-fed, and generated headlines and condemnation around the world.

The hunger strike has evolved into a public relations disaster for the Obama administration, especially as it highlighted the president's failure to fulfil a 2008 campaign promise to close the base. Obama referenced the hunger strike in his speech in what many will likely regard as a tacit acknowledgment of the impact that it has had.

""Look at the current situation where we are force-feeding detainees who are holding a hunger strike. Is that who we are? Is that something that our founders foresaw? Is that the America we want to leave to our children? Our sense of justice is stronger than that,"" he said.

There was criticism for Obama's action among lawyers who work with some of the detainees. Carlos Warner, who represents several Guantanamo detainees, said that appointing an envoy to look into transfers would likely duplicate the work of already existing – and currently ineffective – officials. ""Lifting the moratorium on Yemeni transfers is important, but without a powerful individual charged with transferring individuals, I expect more of the same –innocent men stuck in Guantanamo,"" Warner told The Guardian.

Omar Farah, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, agreed, saying that Obama's words needed to be matched with action. Farah accused the president of over-relying on the good will of Congress to agree to help close the base. ""Many of [the detainees] can be released starting tomorrow without Congressional assistance. In light of the tragedy unfolding at the prison, swift action is imperative. Until we see that, the president's speech is just that – a speech,"" Farah said. Republicans appeared divided on Obama's plans. In a press conference. former Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain said he was committed to working with Obama to close the base but stressed that he wanted a clear plan of action.

Speaking on the same podium, Georgia senator Saxby Chambliss called all the detainees still at the base ""the meanest, nastiest killers in the world"" and said the base should remain open, including for all the Yemenis. ""If we were to transfer these individuals to Yemen it would be just like turning them loose. I don't think that is the right thing to do,"" Chambliss said.",Q1

http://rt.com/news/taliban-afghanistan-peace-talks-442/,"Taliban, Afghan govt meeting for secret peace talks, but with no progress - report","Representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban have once again met in secret negotiations for a peace deal, yet neither side sees much hope of the talks ending in an agreement, reports suggest.

At least two Afghan ministers have met with Taliban delegates in the United Arab Emirates all as Pakistan has been releasing dozens of Taliban prisoners in an effort to revive peace talks, a Taliban official told the AP. Yet the discussions have not progressed, the official says, and the Taliban has been unmoved by the prisoner releases.

As foreign troops are set to leave the country by the end of 2014, a peace deal is crucial in ensuring Afghanistan does not devolved into further civil war. But despite the revived, albeit secret, discussions, both the Taliban and Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s government remain steadfast in their stubborn positions on negotiations.

The United States has pleaded with Karzai to accept a residual force of foreign troops to stay in the country beyond 2014, to help Afghan security forces. But Karzai says before he will accept those terms of the Bilateral Security Agreement, official peace talks must be renewed. At the same time, Karzai has refused to talk with Taliban representatives as long as it calls itself “the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” which the Afghan president sees as an affront to his government’s authority.

The anonymous Taliban official told the AP that his group would accept indirect mediation between the two parties, just as was done in 1989 that led to the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

Nevertheless, both sides question each other’s sincerity. Karzai is seen as stalling to make major decisions until April, when his successor will take over after nationwide elections. Alternately, the Taliban is seen as eagerly anticipating the foreign troops’ exit to take back control and exact revenge for alleged atrocities led by Afghan leaders, such as Vice President Rashid Dostum, a former warlord who has been accused by the Taliban and Western human right organizations of killing thousands of surrendering Taliban at the beginning of the US-led invasion in 2001.

As for the prisoner releases, Pakistan national security adviser Sartaj Aziz said the Taliban have not compromised in response to the gesture, nor have they been moved by Karzai’s reticence to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement, even though insurgents would like to see foreign troops leave.

""They [the Taliban] think it is all a drama and he [Karzai] will sign,"" Aziz told AP.

The Taliban official who revealed the secret meetings is long known to the AP, the news organization said. The official says both the Taliban and other armed groups are gearing up for another confrontation once international troops exit.

He said that while Taliban leadership has an interest in the peace talks, field commanders are opposed, confident they can reclaim the country.

The AP says militias near to senior Afghan government officials are retrieving weapons stockpiles supposedly lost amid a UN-sponsored disarmament program.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post recently reported on the latest US National Intelligence estimate that predicts Afghanistan will descend into civil violence as soon as foreign troops exit.

The peace negotiations that began seven years ago - though they were most prominent three years ago amid the US troop surge - eventually failed based on the Taliban’s choice of title, ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” for an office it opened in Qatar last summer ahead of renewed talks. The Taliban argues the name was accepted even before it ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.",Q1

Peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha were announced in June only to be cancelled in a row over the Taliban displaying their banner and flag. The Doha office was closed within 24 hours of its opening.

“The problem is the Taliban raised their flag and banner at the Doha office and they would be embarrassed now to hold talks without them,” said Habibullah Fouzi, a senior member of the High Peace Council, the body created by Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2010 to pursue negotiations with the Taliban.

Mr Fouzi said he was pessimistic about the Doha office re-opening. “For us what is most important thing is to begin the talks with them in a second location, either Turkey or Saudi.”

Afghan negotiators hope to secure a peace deal with the Taliban ahead of presidential election, due to take place on April 5, 2014.

Beginning of talks is important “so as to know whether they (Taliban) want to be part of the political process”, Mr Fouzi said.

http://www.dw.de/imf-delegation-in-cairo-for-loan-talks/a-16716256?maca=en-rss-en-bus-2091-rdf,IMF in Cairo for talks – DW – 04,"A delegation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has arrived in Egypt to negotiate a multi-billion dollar loan. Cairo must prove that it is committed to reforms, amid ongoing political turmoil.

Cairo and the IMF are set to negotiate a 4.8-billion-dollar (3.7 billion euro) loan on Wednesday to revitalize an economy battered by two years of political upheaval and strikes.

Islamist president Mohammed Morsi's government inked a deal with the IMF last November, however its finalization was postponed due to unrest triggered by a political row over the extent of his powers.

Egyptian officials are expected to pitch an economic reform plan that revamps state energy subsidies and tax hikes, media reports said.

Authorities believe the loan will help restore investor confidence in the country, where unrest and deadly clashes between protesters and police have blocked efforts to build broad-based support for economic reform.

Egypt's foreign currency reserves have fallen critically low, threatening the country's ability to buy wheat, of which it is the world's biggest importer. In the past two years, the reserves have fallen from $36 billion to $13 billion.

On Tuesday, Finance Minister al-Mursi Hegazy described a ""very difficult"" financial situation where foreign reserves would cover imports for only three more months.

The government recently postponed plans to restrict the availability of state-subsidized fuel until July, and some reports say that date may be pushed back even further.

Compiled from International Security Assistance Force Joint Command News Releases

WASHINGTON, June 7, 2013 – Marine Corps Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., International Security Assistance Force commander, today released a statement where he offered his condolences to the families and friends of the seven Georgian service members who were killed yesterday in southern Afghanistan.

'Yesterday we lost seven Georgian service members during a vehicle-borne IED attack on their base in Helmand province,"" Dunford stated. ""I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the fallen and those who served with them. Their memories remain in our hearts and we will never forget their service and sacrifice.

'While this is a sad moment for the Georgian people and the coalition forces, we will not be deterred from our efforts to bring stability and security to the Afghan people,"" the general continued. ""Georgia's support of the ISAF mission has been steadfast and tangible. While many have contributed to the security improvements in Afghanistan, Georgian soldiers have always stood out for their toughness and willingness to take on difficult missions. Georgia has more than 1,500 troops serving in Helmand province, making it the largest non-NATO contributor to ISAF. ISAF will always be grateful for Georgia's contribution and commitment.

'The enemies of Afghanistan continue to use tactics like yesterday's attack to try to slow the momentum of progress, but they will fail,"" Dunford added. ""ISAF and Georgia remain committed to working together with the ANSF as we continue to build on the progress made toward a brighter future for the Afghan people.'

Also today, an Afghan and coalition security force arrested two extremists during a search for a Haqqani facilitator in the Pul-e 'Alam district of Afghanistan's Logar province.

The sought-after insurgent facilitator is responsible for procuring weapons for use by local extremist groups in attacks against Afghan and coalition forces, officials said. He also has a history of participating in high-profile attacks against Afghan and coalition force installations.

capture

Secretary of Statesaid a Taliban commander'sin Afghanistan would not derail a new security pact between the Afghans and United States.

Kerry told reporters in Kabul the suspect, who was captured by U.S. forces Oct. 5, was wanted in the United States in connection with a plot to bomb Times Square in 2010 and was a fairly routine operation.

""We will absolutely work with the government of Afghanistan to cooperate so that the appropriate process flows out of this, to respect their interests and respect their sovereignty,"" said Kerry. ""But this was a normal counter-terrorism procedure, according to the standards that we have been operating by for a long period of time.""

The capture of Latif Mehsud was seen as a fly in the ointment of the negotiations to craft a new security agreement that will govern U.S.-Afghan relations as American troops wind down their long-running mission.

The Washington Post said respect for Afghan laws and jurisdiction over remaining U.S. forces has been a ticklish subject. Afghan intelligence and security officials protested the capture, saying Mehsud was in their custody when he was forcibly taken by American forces.

Kerry said he and Afghan President Harmid Karzi had ironed out the issue Sunday. ""We followed the normal procedures that the United States follows in our agreement,"" he said. ""We regret that this circumstance took place in some ways that some folks apparently the chain of communication didn't go as far. But we did what we are supposed to do under the agreement.""

Karzai said the new agreement, which will be presented to a conference of Afghan tribal leaders next week, guarantees respect for Afghan sovereignty and that Washington would have to take it seriously.

""Our discussion today in particular has been focused on making sure that through the Bilateral Security Agreement, we make sure that such violations are not repeated,"" Karzai said. ""If they [the United States] want to be partner with us, this partnership must completely guarantee sovereignty and security of Afghanistan. We receive this through our document, but the rest will be up to the Afghan government and our friends, and in order to build on this, based on mutual respect and friendship.""",Q1

One of the hunger strikers says, through his lawyer, that military guards have reduced the conditions at the detention facility to sub-human standards. The more than 30-day-old protest among dozens of the detainees will end if the guards agree to respect their holy books, he says.

The Defense Department dismisses the detainees' claims as an ongoing ""concerted information operation"" campaign.

""We're not even looking for human rights, we're looking for animal rights. And the way we've been treated here in Guantanamo Bay is nothing less than being treated like a dog,"" recounts Jason Wright, a U.S. Army captain with the Office of the Chief Defense Counsel, of a discussion with his client, known as Obaidullah.

Military officials at Guantanamo Bay have denied Wright and other defense attorneys from visiting their clients in recent days, they say.

The hunger strike began after detainees witnessed Joint Task Force–GTMO guards on Feb. 7 conducting a complete ""shakedown"" of all of the Camp 6 cells to search for contraband, Obaidullah told Wright. The guards flipped through and shook detainees' copies of the Koran, he claims, ignoring cultural restrictions on handling the holy book. Camp 6 is one of the detention facilities for non-high value detainees where they usually have access to one another in a communal living configuration. In a raid that turned violent on Saturday, guards forcibly moved the detainees into single-cell confinement where they remain on lockdown.

Requests for comment from JTF-GTMO were not returned in time for this report.

""The detainees' negotiating posture was, 'Just don't search the Koran,'"" says Wright. ""'That's all we're asking. And if you think you want to search the Koran, you can take them back. It's more important for us to respect and revere God than it is to have it searched in such a rough and vile manner.'""

Wright says there has been ""no constructive engagement on these issues,"" from military officials. The Pentagon disagrees.

""This is an absurdly baseless claim built around establishing a foothold in the media, and has no basis in fact,"" says Defense Department spokesman Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale. ""Any reference to mishandling any religious article is 100 percent due to a concerted information operation campaign waged by the detainees.""

The hunger strike began over 30 days ago and involves as many as 60 of the 166 detainees on the island, according to some reports. Wright says ""a vast majority"" of them are participating, except for the sick or elderly, and that it serves as ""a proxy for the frustration of indefinite detention, of detention without trial and of false promises by [President Barack] Obama to close the facility.""

Wright visited Obaidullah most recently between March 18 and March 22, when the native Afghan said his weight had dropped from 167 pounds to 125 pounds as a result of the protest. Obaidullah has been detained at the U.S. base, often referred to as Gitmo, for 11 years for a suspected affiliation as an IED expert with an al-Qaida cell in Khost, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.

Obaidullah also says the guards now choose to enforce operating procedures from 2006 that prohibit the detainees from having any unofficial items in their cells, such as books or pictures of their families, and that the Camp 6 facility has been made uncomfortably cold after the temperature was turned down roughly 10 degrees.

""There have been no changes in the way the camp administers access to privileges,"" says Breasseale. ""But the camp is enforcing its long-standing rules against contraband.""

""I'm unaware of any of the detainees having access to thermometers,"" he says, adding the temperature in the cells is between 70 and 74 degrees in keeping with ""long standing procedure at the facility.""

Wright says detainees have started scribbling ""SOS"" on the outside of their cells to attract media attention, so ""the world would understand what's happening around Guantanamo Bay.""

""This is supposed to be a preventative detention under the rules of war, not punitive detention,"" he says. ""But the command's philosophy just upended it. They want to treat these men like criminals.""

His requests to meet with the commander of the detention facility have been denied. Wright's defense team colleagues have also been denied access to meet with their client the week of April 22.

""In our request for meetings, we explained to JTF-GTMO our concern for our client's health,"" says defense attorney Cindy Panuco in an email to U.S. News. The defense team also had an April 29 deadline to file an appeal, which it needed to discuss with Obaidullah.

""That request was denied and the only justification given was 'Unfortunately, Guantanamo is unable to accommodate this request for the specified time frame,'"" she says.

The defense team did not submit the requests 20 days in advance of the visit, per regulations, Panuco says.

""It appears that even under the current circumstances and with an impending litigation deadline, they will not approve our visit,"" she says.

The U.S. government has no plans to try Obaidullah in the ""foreseeable future,"" says Wright, adding the defense team has evidence that would prove his innocence.

""So he's stuck in a situation of indefinite detention right now; a legal limbo,"" he says. ""Afghanistan is not clamoring for his return, but also the U.S. government is not doing anything to work on his repatriation release, or his trial.""",Q1

Presidential palace media office following a statement announced, “President Hamid Karzai met today with Ismet Yilmaz, Turkish Defense Minister to discuss issues of mutual interest.”

The source further added, “At the meeting held in the Presidential Palace, President Karzai called Afghan-Turk relations as good and historic and thanked Turkey- a friend and brother for its assistance, describing as important the Turkish presence beyond 2014 in Afghanistan.”

“The two sides discussed the progress towards concluding a long-term strategic partnership document to be signed between Afghanistan and Turkey” the statement said adding that, “They also underscored to finalize the document as soon as possible.”

Turkish Defense Minister quoted in the statement released by presidential palace said that his country was ready to continue its training beyond 2014 as long as Afghanistan demands it.

He also expressed his pleasure over successful progress of the security transition, declaring that Turkey is prepared to provide any cooperation for peace, stability and welfare of Afghanistan.

This comes as Afghanistan signed similar strategic cooperation agreements with US, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Australia and India.

Afghan foreign ministry earlier also announced to sign long term strategic cooperation agreement with all the NATO member countries.

The latest, dated August 7, lists 553 rhinos poached so far this year and 147 arrests. South Africa is on track to lose 900 to 1,000 rhinos to poachers in 2013, smashing last year’s macabre record of 668. The epidemic of rhino poaching that broke out in 2008 shows no sign of dying down.

Africa’s elephants are also being shot in extraordinary and rising numbers for their ivory, now a hot-selling status and investment commodity in China. Experts estimate that a mind-boggling 25,000 to 40,000 elephants are being killed annually across the continent, which could be close to 10 percent of the total number remaining, and significantly more than are born each year.

Rhino and elephant protectors have sprung into action in an increasingly militarized effort to stamp out this carnage. Governments have given game rangers better weapons, engaged intelligence analysts, and put spotter planes, helicopters, and unmanned drones into the air. Some have deployed their national defense forces into national parks. Private wildlife custodians have spent millions on their own armed anti-poaching guards, sniffer dogs, mini-drones, and informants.

But as the response to rhino and elephant poaching has become progressively more militarized, a stubborn reality remains: The continental-scale slaughter of rhinos and elephants continues to intensify, despite rising arrests and killings of poachers and increasing interdiction of illegal shipments of rhino horn and ivory. And although the toll would no doubt be worse without the anti-poaching efforts, experts say that other aspects of the battle to save Africa’s wildlife — including improving justice systems and launching efforts to reduce consumer demand for wildlife products — have been given short shrift.

“You’re not going to just enforce your way out of this,” says Peter Knights, executive director of WildAid, a California-based conservation group that focuses on the consumer side of the illegal wildlife trade. “You’re never going to stop [poaching] by just putting new boots on guys in Africa because it’s a [game of] whack-a-mole.”

Knights believes that illicit wildlife products “always find their way out” to consumers who are willing to pay for them. That view is echoed by some drug policy experts, who liken the uphill battle against African poaching to the war on drugs, where the militarized enforcement-and-interdiction approach has been an extraordinarily expensive, bloody failure. “Where there is persistent demand for an illegal substance, there will be supply,” Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based group that advocates for drug policy reform, told me.

The effort to stem the tide of rhino and elephant poaching has become a global concern. Saying that wildlife crime undermines security — a thinly disguised reference to terrorism — U.S. President Barack Obama last month announced a new Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking.

Unmanned aircraft and two companies of soldiers have been deployed in Kruger National Park.

No place better illustrates the challenges of protecting pachyderms than South Africa’s Kruger National Park, which has lost far more rhinos than any other African park in recent years. It has come under siege by poachers working for criminal networks that smuggle the horns — used in traditional Chinese medicine — through neighboring Mozambique to illegal markets in Asia.

South African National Parks’ (SANParks) first response to the outbreak of poaching in 2008 was to ramp up conventional ranger patrols in Kruger, home to thousands of rhinos. Poachers, mainly from Mozambique, responded by coming in larger groups, a “triggerman” with a heavy-caliber hunting rifle and “guards” carrying AK-47s. They weren’t shy about shooting at rangers, and many firefights ensued, some with fatal results. SANParks began retraining and better arming its rangers, who arrested and shot more poachers, but it wasn’t enough — the poachers kept coming in even greater numbers.

In 2011 the South African National Defense Force deployed two companies of troops, 265 men, in and around the park to help with the fight. Park enforcers got more air support, including more helicopters. A new spotter plane was donated by a South African arms exporter in late 2012, and various unmanned aircraft — including sophisticated military drones made by South African arms manufacturer Denel — have recently been deployed over the park on a trial basis. “Many arrests are now made with air support,” a spokesperson for SANParks told me.

SANParks has an annual anti-poaching budget of about $7.5 million, much of that spent in Kruger, and support worth millions more is provided by other government departments and private donors. More poachers are being arrested than ever before, and at least 23 have been shot dead by rangers since 2008. Nevertheless, the rhino slaughter is intensifying: So far this year, 345 rhino have been poached in the park, more than double the number killed in the first seven months of 2012.

Scores of rhino charities now collect millions of dollars annually around the world for public and private anti-poaching efforts across Africa. South Africa’s large private game farming and wildlife safari industries also now collectively spend millions of dollars annually on new armed guards. Most anti-poaching companies offer military-style training, and some are operated by South African soldiers of fortune who have worked for U.S. security contractors in Afghanistan and Iraq.

One company, Diceros, is marketing an integrated system made up of U.S. and South African military and security industry technology that includes high-definition radar, in-earth microphones, communications interception, long-range cameras, and drones. The company says that its gear currently monitors cattle rustlers and other smugglers on and around Lake Victoria in central Africa’s Rift Valley, with great success.

WWF is researching integrated high-tech, drone-centered surveillance systems in the arid north of Namibia. Funded by a $5 million grant from Google, WWF’s aim is to find reliable ways of integrating imagery from unarmed drones with real-time information about the location of poachers, armed ranger patrols, and electronically tagged rhinos so that rangers can be optimally deployed to protect the animals. Crawford Allan, a senior WWF/TRAFFIC wildlife crime expert, said that the project had been approached by dozens of drone manufacturers because “their military contracts are depleting and they’re looking for civilian applications” for their aircraft.

A key failing lies in the continent’s judicial systems, where judges don’t take wildlife crime seriously.

Kenya, which has lost a steadily increasing number of elephants and rhinos in recent years, has also entered the arms race with poachers, increasing its government budget for armed ranger patrols and just last week announcing a new, elite anti-poaching unit.

Many other African countries, including Botswana, Gabon and Cameroon, have deployed military units to conservation areas in recent years in response to increased poaching, including high-profile mass killings of elephants in central Africa by poachers with links to Janjaweed militias in Sudan.

Still, the epidemic rages on, prompting many experts to argue that a wider effort is needed. A key failing, conservationists say, lies in the continent’s justice systems, where evidence collection is often botched, prosecutions poorly handled, and judges often don’t take wildlife crime seriously, which sends the message that poaching is no big deal. Although some low-ranking “triggermen” have been caught and jailed in South Africa, cases against higher-level kingpins have dragged out for years.

In Kenya, conservationists were outraged when two guards implicated in a recent, brazen theft of ivory from an allegedly secure government stockpile were fired but not prosecuted. On July 1, a former U.S. defense attache, David McNevin, was caught at Nairobi airport with illegal ivory in his luggage. Despite the case’s high profile, his only punishment was a fine of about $350.

Incidents like these have amplified calls for poaching to be treated as seriously as drug smuggling and terrorism, with which, criminologists point out, it is often linked logistically and financially. President Obama’s new task force on wildlife trafficking is heavily populated by representatives from the departments involved in anti-drug and anti-terror efforts.

A well-crafted social awareness campaign in Asia could drastically reduce demand for rhino horn and ivory.

But, like the war on drugs, there are early signs that the war on poaching is plagued by the so-called “balloon effect.”

“When you suppress drug production in one area, it pops up in another” because consumer demand persists, said Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance. The South African rhino crisis, for example, was preceded by a little-publicized wave of poaching in neighboring Zimbabwe, said Jo Shaw, WWF-South Africa’s rhino policy expert. Conservationists responded by relocating the country’s remaining animals into relatively small “intensive protection” zones, after which poaching took off in South Africa.

Wildlife traffickers are already shifting illicit transport routes in response to interdiction efforts through countries with weak controls, such as Togo. Some of the largest illegal ivory consignments recently interdicted in Asia, involving thousands of tusks, have originated at Togo’s port, Lome. Since Togo probably has a population of fewer than 65 elephants, the ivory clearly comes from elsewhere. In southern Africa, smugglers now avoid going through Johannesburg’s international airport, preferring the nearby, more poorly policed airport in Maputo, Mozambique.

If enforcement and interdiction is not sufficient, what else night work? Nadelmann cites a case from the drug world involving the club drug Ecstacy, popular in the 1990s. Its popularity declined rapidly after dealers began adulterating its main ingredient with other substances, thus destroying its reputation among users. Nadelmann suggested that “creative interventions in the market” designed to create distrust among Asian buyers about the quality or value of rhino horn and ivory might lower demand.

Some South African rhino owners are already attempting to degrade the value of rhino horn by injecting a combination of toxic insecticides and indelible dye into live animals’ horns. The toxic dye concoction will likely sicken (but not kill) consumers and will also make the horns more visible on x-ray machines. It’s too early to say if this has reduced demand, but owners are confident that it at least inspires poachers to avoid shooting animals with tainted horns.

Some media-savvy conservation groups say that well-crafted public relations and social awareness campaigns in Asia could significantly reduce demand for rhino horn and ivory, pointing to recent successes by a campaign to cut shark fin use. WildAid, which has produced slick video spots featuring celebrities to persuade Asians not to consume shark fin soup, said that shark fin imports into Hong Kong, a major hub for the trade, dropped by more than 70 percent from 2011 to 2012 as the campaign took effect.

WildAid’s Peter Knights said that the group has recently produced spots against rhino horn and ivory consumption, but had struggled for over a decade to fund them. It’s extremely difficult to raise money for campaigns to reduce demand, said Crawford Allan of WWF/TRAFFIC, because “donors like to see boots on the ground and technology.” Other conservationists say that donors, politicians, and the media find images of armed anti-poaching patrols, drones, and military equipment “sexy,” lamenting that the multi-faceted nature of the struggle to save rhinos and elephants is often glossed over.

Knights told me that policymakers have recently shown greater interest in targeting demand in Asia. Meanwhile, the stakes for rhinos and elephants get higher by the day, as ever-stronger groups of poachers continue to reap their harvests across Africa.",Q1

Afghanistan’s Defense Minister insists a security deal with the United States will be signed before the end-of-year deadline, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Hagel’s unannounced trip — to thank troops for their service — comes in the wake of an impasse between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and U.S. and foreign allies over a security deal that would allow some U.S. troops to remain to train government military, the Associated Press reports.

Karzai has refused to sign the agreement after the Loya Jirga, a council of leaders and tribal elders, approved the deal last month and urged him to sign it by the end of December. He wants his successor, who will be voted into office in April, to sign the deal, and said he won’t sign a deal that allows military forces to raid Afghan homes.

U.S. and NATO troops will leave Afghanistan at the end of 2014, and without a signed agreement, none will remain to assist with the country’s transition.

Hagel does not plan to meet with Karzai during his visit.

Officials say the decision will not be made soon, news agencies are reporting.

But White House Press Secretary Jay Carney Tuesday played down reports that President Barack Obama may pull all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan when American combat troops leave at the end of next year.

He said the so-called “zero option” is one of many possible plans for postwar Afghanistan, and that the president is under no pressure to decide soon.

“I want to make clear, today’s story notwithstanding, that this is not a decision that is imminent. And we are talking about a residual force, a potential residual force, in a year and a half. So these are ongoing conversations,” said Carney.

The Obama administration has discussed the possibility of the “zero option” for several months. In January, the president’s deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told reporters the administration would consider the zero option if all U.S. goals in Afghanistan are met.

“The objective of the bilateral security agreement negotiations is not to accomplish a number of U.S. troops in a country. It is to accomplish the two goals of denying a safe haven to al-Qaida and training and equipping Afghan national security forces,” said Rhodes.

EU politicians have been wrangling over the issue for months.

The statements that came out of the European Parliament on Thursday contradicted reports from just a few hours earlier, suggesting that a breakthrough deal had been achieved that would seek lawmakers approval of the proposed budget.

Parliamentarians from all four major groups vehemently denied that an agreement had been reached. Some suggested Wednesday night's statement by Irish Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore, claiming that an agreement on the seven-year budget had been reached, was optimistic at best.

Ireland holds the EU's six-month, rotating presidency until the end of June.

Conservative lawmaker Reimer Böge spoke of ""a rather objectionable manipulation"" by the presidency, adding that he would step down as parliamentary budget negotiator.

""It is clear that there is no agreement from the European Parliament at this time,"" the leader of the socialist group, Hannes Swoboda, said. ""We will not take a rushed decision without due consideration ... I cannot be blackmailed.""

The parliamentary leader of the liberal democrats struck a similar tone.

""On the basis of the disparate and partial evidence we have so far seen, an agreement has not yet been reached,"" liberal democratic leader Guy Verhofstadt said.

The leader of the far-left GUE/NGL group went even farther, accusing both the European Commission and the Irish presidency of having ""intentionally misled the public.""

The seven-year EU budget regulates what the bloc can spend on things like agricultural subsidies, infrastructure, and measures to support employment.

Historic spending cut

The process of trying to finalize a budget for the years 2014-2020 has been going on for several months. The leaders of the EU's 27 member states agreed back in February on a budget worth 960 billion euros ($1.27 trillion), which would represent a first-ever spending cut.

A provision included in the EU's 2007 Lisbon Treaty gives the European Parliament a say in fiscal matters, meaning this is the first time that the EU has needed their approval to implement a long-term budget.

EU politicians on Thursday reiterated calls for lawmakers to approve the provisional deal.

""We need clarity,"" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble said. ""We don't want to put aside the means to fight youth unemployment.""

His Austrian counterpart, Maria Fekter, warned parliamentarians that ""not all wishes can be fulfilled.""

Hundreds of pages of court documents in Kansas City and New York illustrate how Khalid Ouazzani -- a Kansas City used auto parts salesman and failed real estate investor -- and two other naturalized American citizens were fleeced out of tens of thousands of dollars by Al Qaeda leaders who exploited their zeal to wage holy war, The Kansas City Star reported.

In a recent letter to a New York federal judge, a lawyer representing cell member Sabirhan Hasanoff -- a Brooklyn accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers who moved to Dubai in 2007 -- acknowledged that Hasanoff once dreamed about jihad glory but instead got taken by a Yemeni con man.

""The defendants never had any authentic access to terrorism networks or Islamic extremists, and were victims of a rudimentary fraud,"" the lawyer wrote.

Federal prosecutors responded that while Hasanoff couldn't control how his contributions would be used, he intended them to support Al Qaeda's terrorist goals.

Ouazzani, Hanoff and Wesam El-Hanafi, who was an information security specialist in Brooklyn with Lehman Brothers before moving to Dubai around 2005, all aspired to ""support violent extremist Islamic causes,"" prosecutors have said. They are awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in Kansas City and New York to various federal crimes.

All three also are married, have children and didn't care much for the idea of blowing themselves up for the cause.

Court records show that El-Hanafi connected with two experienced terrorists in Yemen in mid-2007. One of the men, referred to in court records as ""Suffian,"" had recently left prison and was eager to resume his work for Al Qaeda.

The other man, referred to as ""The Doctor,"" was an experienced jihadi who claimed to have fought the Soviets in Afghanistan and pledged his support in the 1990s to an organization that later merged with Al Qaeda. He also ran an automobile business in Yemen.

The three Americans began sending $300 a month to their new friends in Yemen to prove they were serious. Ouazzani also offered a $6,500 commitment to the cause, which he couldn't afford most likely because of real estate losses in Kansas City. Hasanoff covered Ouazzani's contribution and later badgered him with emails demanding repayment.

The three also sent watches, cold-weather gear, Garmin GPS units and a remote-control car to the terrorist leaders.

After being arrested by Yemeni authorities, Suffian and The Doctor told FBI agents the Americans believed the money and equipment were being set aside for their military training that eventually would land them in Somalia, Iraq or Afghanistan.

Instead, The Doctor admitted he and Suffian divided the material loot between themselves, gave some of the money to the families of Islamic martyrs and bought a couple of automobiles.

The three Americans also had planned to send a $45,000 contribution in late 2008, which The Doctor had earmarked for a personal investment.

""(The Doctor's) plan was to take the Americans' money,"" Suffian is quoted as saying in one FBI interview. ""For example, (The Doctor) was planning on using the $45,000 to open an appliance store.""

Eventually the Americans became impatient and pressed The Doctor and Suffian for word about when they would travel for jihad. The Yemenis urged patience, saying the three were better suited for an operation in the U.S. than fighting in foreign countries.

The process would be sped up dramatically, though, if they consented to a ""martyrdom"" operation, one of Suffian's terror contacts told him.

""The Americans . advised (Suffian) that they did not want to do a martyrdom operation, but still wanted to travel for jihad,"" the FBI reported.",Q1

Working alongside American forces, Afghan National Security Forces conducted searches of trucks for contraband and ensured drivers had the proper paperwork to operating on Kandahar’s roads in January 2012. (Harold McGill/Courtesy Defense Department )

KABUL — NATO forces and the Afghan government have reached an understanding over the touchy issue of customs tariffs, which could have cost the U.S. and its allies hundreds of millions of dollars as it ships equipment out of the country.

Last month, The Washington Post reported that the government was fining the U.S. military $1,000 for each shipping container that didn’t have a validated customs form. However, a Military Technical Agreement signed between ISAF and Afghanistan’s interim government in 2002 stipulates that ISAF is exempt from providing routine customs documentation on materiel.

The dispute over customs tariffs essentially halted ISAF shipping over Afghanistan’s borders, and could have forced NATO partners to airlift all their supplies into and out of the country. The Post said that could have added hundreds of millions of dollars to retrograde costs as the U.S. prepares to withdraw all combat troops by the end of 2014.

Najeeb Manaly, spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, said the Military Technical Agreement was signed when the Afghan government was weak and willing to accept any of ISAF’s demands.

He said the government had given every ISAF military vehicle entering the country a receipt that had to be validated and returned to the government within 21 days, or they would face a $1,000 fine. But ISAF failed to get validation for 70,000 trucks, racking up a bill of $70 million.

Manaly also said the government merely wanted a letter vouching for the validity of each container of military goods passing over the border.

“We just want some paperwork, because if they are taking out a container there should be a letter telling us what this container contains,” he said. “Because it’s military goods, we cannot open it to check what’s there.”

However, the Military Technical Agreement states that “ISAF will be exempt from providing inventories or other routine customs documentation on personnel, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, equipment, supplies, and provisions entering and exiting or transiting Afghanistan territory in support of the International Security Force.”

ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Will Griffin said the dispute was essentially a misunderstanding.

“This issue basically was rooted in interpretation of the Afghan customs process,” he said. “We were encouraged by developments in the last couple of days.”

According to an ISAF news release issued Thursday, the Afghan Ministry of Finance recommended the government waive all the penalties and fines related to ISAF customs paperwork. President Hamid Karzai’s Cabinet approved the recommendation.

“We appreciate the government’s adherence to the Military Technical Agreement,” the release quotes ISAF commander Gen. Joseph Dunford as saying. “This agreement provides our forces with the freedom of movement necessary to effectively support our Afghan counterparts as they secure the Afghan people.”

The new understanding does not, however, mention Afghan taxes on contractors working for ISAF. In May, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reported contractors working for the U.S. had paid nearly a billion dollars in Afghan taxes and penalties.

http://www.globalresearch.ca/washingtons-battle-over-syrian-foreign-policy-will-hawks-or-doves-prevail/5339402,Washington’s Battle Over Syrian Foreign Policy: Will Hawks Or Doves Prevail? - Global Research,"Like Putin’s policy in Russia, Obama’s Syrian policy is being tugged strenuously in Washington, both by hawks and by doves. On June 13, Obama handed two limited but ominous victories to the hawks: a finding of fact that the troops of Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad “have used chemical weapons [i.e. sarin] against rebel forces,” and a consequent decision “to begin supplying the rebels for the first time with small arms and ammunition.”1

Both announcements sound very strange, if not dishonest, to anyone who has been following the Syrian crisis. Deputy National Security Adviser Benjamin Rhodes, one of Obama’s top foreign policy advisers, was quoted by the New York Times as saying that “there was no reason to think that the resistance has access to chemical weapons.” Thus, like most of the mainstream U.S. media, Rhodes simply ignored the reports last May in the British media that “U.N. human rights investigators have gathered testimony from casualties of Syria’s civil war and medical staff indicating that rebel forces have used the nerve agent sarin.”2 Three weeks later there were additional disputed reports that a 2kg cylinder with sarin gas had been seized from Syrian rebel forces in Turkey.3 We thus see another U.S. case, as a decade ago in Iraq, of policy steering intelligence, rather than vice versa.

The second announcement, that the U.S. would “begin supplying the rebels,” is also hard to reconcile with reality. As the Times itself revealed three months ago, the CIA since early 2012 has helped facilitate an airlift of 3500 tons or more of arms to the rebels from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.4



Syrian rebels will receive new infusions of US arms



The role of Saudi Arabia and Qatar as cutouts reprises a pattern seen in Bosnia in 2003 and especially Libya in 2011; and this history tells us that although Washington would prefer that the arms not reach Salafist jihadis, it will be difficult or impossible to stop this from happening.5 What is clear is that the new weapons will add to the slaughter without ending it – a slaughter that is ever more directed against civilians on all sides.6

With these small moves Obama has granted the hawks, like Republican Senator John McCain, far less than they wish. In the same announcement, Benjamin Rhodes “all but ruled out the option of a no-fly zone,” the no-boots-on-the-ground strategy that ousted Gaddafi in Iraq. By ruling out a no-fly zone, Obama may still hope to forestall a Russian move to supply Assad with advanced anti-aircraft missiles, a step almost certain to provoke Israeli involvement and perhaps a further expansion of the conflict into Lebanon and Iraq.

With the support of an Op-Ed in the New York Times,7 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met in early May with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, and the two agreed to reconvene an international conference by late May to deal with the Syrian crisis (at a time when an EU arms embargo was due to expire). The conference was, however, postponed and is still in doubt, largely because the west’s preferred clients in the uprising, the Free Syrian Army, refuse to participate while they are currently losing.

Kerry and Lavrov met again in Paris in late May, and the outcome this time was more ominous. Russian media still reported, with guarded optimism, about a prospective but delayed conference.8 American media however ignored or downplayed the conference notion. Instead they quoted a State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell, who rebuked Moscow for announcing it would deliver an advanced guided S-300 anti-aircraft missile system to Syria; and he added that America would now support the easing of the EU arms embargo.9

Two features of Obama’s Syrian policy, mutually offsetting, have been visible since he first took office. The first has been his extreme caution, and his refusal to rush into commitments like the one that has America currently bogged down in Afghanistan. The second has been a tendency to justify his delaying tactics by abstract policy statements fit only for headlines, as when in August 2011 he said categorically that Assad must “step aside.” He thus left himself with a policy position that Russia will not agree to, and no policy to make it happen.

Meanwhile, numerous informed American and international analyses of the Syrian crisis warn that the conflict, already a proxy war pitting Turkey and the Arabian peninsula countries against Iran, could become still larger and more dangerous.10 However, these reports tend to ignore the brute petroleum realities which are likely to determine Assad’s downfall, if they are not directly confronted and rebutted.

Syria’s petroleum reserves were estimated in 2010 at 2,500,000,000 barrels. More importantly, Syria is the most obvious land route for any pipelines to export oil and gas from the Persian Gulf, including Iran, to the energy-hungry nations of western Europe. But the Kirkuk–Baniyas crude oil pipeline, from the Kirkuk oil field in Iraq to the Mediterranean, was destroyed by U.S. air strikes in 2003 and never reopened.

In 2009 Qatar and Turkey began negotiating a new natural gas pipeline across Saudi Arabia and Syria to Turkey, to link up with the proposed Nabucco pipeline across Turkey from Azerbaijan.11 A route through Iraq seemed increasingly problematic, however, with the increasing conflicts there. Meanwhile, according to Oilprice.com, Saudi Arabia denied Qatar the use of its territory, leaving a route through southern Iraq and Syria for Qatar to “secure a new source of income. Pipelines are in place already in Turkey to receive the gas. Only Al-Assad is in the way.”12

The Financial Times has since reported that

The tiny gas-rich state of Qatar has spent as much as $3bn over the past two years supporting the rebellion in Syria, far exceeding any other government…. its financial support for the revolution that has turned into a vicious civil war dramatically overshadows western backing for the opposition.13

The informed website ZeroHedge.com has commented that this considerable investment is “as so often happens in the middle east,… once again all about the natural resources.”14

Qatar’s North Dome gas field, in the middle of the Persian Gulf, is one with Iran’s South Pars field, and together they constitute the largest gas field in the world. In 2011 Assad rejected an ultimatum from Qatar and instead agreed with Iran and Iraq to build a new Iran-Syria pipeline which would transfer natural gas to the Mediterranean from Iran’s South Pars natural gas field rather than Qatar’s North Dome.15 (We should recall that similar challenges to American petrodollar hegemony were made by Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, with fatal consequences to them and their regimes.)16

As Pepe Escobar has commented,

The key (unstated) reason for Qatar to be so obsessed by regime change in Syria is to kill the $10 billion Iran-Iraq-Syria [natural gas] pipeline, which was agreed upon in July 2011. The same applies to Turkey, because this pipeline would bypass Ankara, which always bills itself as the key energy crossroads between East and West. It’s crucial to remember that the Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline is … anathema to Washington…. The difference is that Washington in this case can count on its allies Qatar and Turkey to sabotage the whole deal.17

One of the great downsides of covert foreign policies is that crucial world-changing decisions are entrusted to gung-ho cowboys with little oversight and still less interest in the long-term consequences of their disruptive actions. We saw this two decades ago when the CIA, overriding the State Department, helped Pakistan’s ISI, in collusion with the Salafist jihadi Hekmatyar, overthrow the relatively moderate Najibullah government in Afghanistan that had been left behind when the Soviets withdrew.18

Former Ambassador Peter Tomsen has written an eloquent memoir, The Wars of Afghanistan, about this under-acknowledged tragedy, out of which grew both 9/11 and a war America is still fighting:

Under Secretary for Political Affairs Robert Kimmitt and I tried to close the gap between the State Department and the CIA’s Directorate of Operations on Afghan policy. I met twice with Deputy CIA Director Richard Kerr to resolve differences. But the agency persisted in backing the ISI’s military attacks on Kabul aimed at replacing Najib[ullah] with Hekmatyar…. Separately, the State Department and the CIA were operating at cross purposes. That was a certain recipe for paralysis and ultimate policy failure.19

Unless there is a significant change, we can anticipate the same tragedy again in Syria — with the CIA, in collusion with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, facilitating arms to similar Sunni jihadis, while the State Department officials seek, with their Russian counterparts, a peaceful resolution to this crisis.

The alternative would be a timely reconvening of an international Geneva Conference, with or without the various rebel factions, and certainly with the participation of Qatar and two other countries excluded from the last such conference: Iran and Saudi Arabia. All these nations are already part of the conflict, and all these nations, like the rest of the world, have legitimate interests that would be better served by peace.20

http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-28255-PM-forms-panel-for-talks-with-Taliban,Chinese help reaches Pakistan to fight corona,"ISLAMABAD: Following urgent calls for medical supplies, Pakistan on Friday received tonnes of protective gear and testing kits from China to contain the spread of coronavirus. The continuing and unprecedented assistance from China via air and road comes at a critical time when Pakistan’s medical workers struggle to treat patients as the number of confirmed cases surpassed 1,200 on Friday. “At least 2 tonnes of masks, test kits, ventilators, medical protective clothes worth Rs67 million were handed over [to Pakistani officials] at Khunjerab Pass”, the highest paved international border, according to a statement by Chinese embassy in Pakistan. “This is the friendship higher than mountains!” the embassy said, international media reported.

On Friday morning, trucks full of medical supplies were unloaded at the border as the teams from both sides braved the harsh weather and snow. Meanwhile, a plane carrying 50,000 coronavirus testing kits also arrived in Karachi on March 27. This was the second bulk consignment sent by China’s Alibaba and Jack Ma Foundation within days. On March 25, the foundation sent 500,000 surgical masks and 50,000 N95 respirators to Pakistan. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Consul General of China Li Bijian and other officials received the supplies at Karachi airport.

On Thursday, Yan Chen, managing director of Challenge Group of Companies from China called on Prime Minister Imran Khan to donate 15,000 protection suits for Pakistani doctors and paramedical staff on the frontline battling the pandemic. To meet the increasing demand for protective gear, China will help produce the protection suit in Pakistan’s city of Lahore, said the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing. Chinese government and leadership is committed to support Pakistan in combating Covid-19 as their top priority, the ambassador added.

Pakistani premier conveyed sincere gratitude to China for supporting Pakistan. “The medical equipment provided by China will greatly strengthen Pakistan’s capacity” to fight the virus, PM Imran Khan said.

Pakistan will receive around 20 tonnes of medical goods and 20 ventilators on an urgent basis from China this week, said Chairman National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Lt Gen Mohammed Afzal, during Friday 27 media talk. Additionally, two more planes would bring 100 tonnes of urgently needed medical equipment from Beijing and Chengdu next week.

Following Governor Punjab Chaudhry Sarwar’s request, a Chinese university has also agreed to work with Pakistani medical experts to convert a university campus into a 1,000-bed field hospital. The field hospital would be set up in Lahore. The University would also work in collaboration with Pakistani scientists to develop testing kits and other equipment in Pakistan.

China will also send an eight-member team of doctors next week to work closely with local health officials. “China is preparing a medical team to visit Pakistan who will pay field trips to different localities in Pakistan,” Zeng Yixin, Vice Minister of China’s National Health Commission told Pakistan’s state-run news agency, APP. The team would also share experiences and exchange views on the use of technology to combat the epidemic. The Chinese team will also support Pakistan in building temporary quarantine hospitals.

The Chinese government is also sending a walk-through testing machine to Pakistan to diagnose a large number of suspected people for the novel coronavirus. The “walk-through machine will arrive at Khunjerab Pass by next week” and it would ensure mass testing especially in the areas with Covid-19 clusters, the NDMA chairman said.

There are currently 194,000 medical health practitioners in Pakistan, of which 30,000 work in ICUs. “These 30,000 medical practitioners working in ICUs will be equipped with complete medical kit by April,” he said. Each box will contain face-shields, goggles, two N95 and 30 surgical masks, hand wash kit.

The number of beds in the intensive care unit (ICUs) in Pakistan currently is 19,670. The capacity of quarantine facilities has also been enhanced from 500 beds to 162,000 now. Pakistan’s Covid-19 command and control centre has also booked 1,795 three-star and four-star hotels where 40,000 patients can be accommodated if required.

There are nearly 2200 ventilators available in public hospitals. The number of the imported ventilators will reach to 1,000 by April 10 to 15, the NDMA chief said. This number would rise to 2,000 to 3,000 by April 25 and the officials expect to enhance it to 8,000 and 10,000 by May.

Pakistan would have enough medical equipment, including personal protection kits, by April 5 to improve the safety of the health officials working on the frontline, said Health Minister Dr Zafar Mirza.

Pakistan’s top three priorities under the Covid-19 strategy, according to NDMA chairman: are 1. Medical gear for doctors & health workers; 2. Ventilators & supplies for treatment of patients; 3. Coronavirus testing kits",Q1
http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/28/marines-court-martial-video-afghan,Marines court martial: UK government argues releasing video would risk lives,"Releasing a video showing three British marines allegedly murdering an injured prisoner in Afghanistan would be a propaganda gift to extremists and put UK troops and civilians at real and immediate risk, the government has argued at a court martial.

Media organisations including the Guardian have asked the military court to make available the footage that shows the three marines allegedly carrying out the ""execution"" of a man believed to be an Afghan insurgent. The footage has been shown in open court and a transcript of it published.

But, arguing that the video clips should not be released, a senior Home Office counter-terrorism official said they would go viral within minutes, would be used by terrorism groups as propaganda and would prompt ""lone actors"" to attack troops or members of the public.

Paul Mott, the deputy head of the research, information and communications unit in the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, said it was the most potent footage of its kind he had viewed.

""I've seen nothing that surpasses it in terms of radicalisation potential. It's exceptionally worrying,"" said Mott. ""There's nothing I have seen that … matches its emotional power. It is a gift in propaganda terms.""

Mott said the footage would be disseminated via Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. He said in its raw form it was powerful, but terrorists would add their own commentary to it and use it to claim it proves that the west is at war with Muslims.

The footage shows a prisoner being dragged out of a field in Helmand having been badly wounded by helicopter fire. The clips, captured by a head-camera worn by one of the marines, appears to show the prisoner being shot in the chest by a marine. All three marines, who have been granted anonymity by the court, deny murder.

Mott said the footage was ""compelling and distressing"". He said it could be a ""tipping point"" for ""lone actors"" on the point of committing an atrocity.

He told the court in Bulford, Wiltshire, that there had already been talk about the case in extremism forums.

The expert said the government had ""taken full account of the importance of open justice … especially in a case where it is the actions of the armed forces which are under scrutiny"". But he said: ""Releasing it would present a real threat to life for members of the armed forces and the wider British public and for British interests overseas.""

Mott cited examples of extremists who had committed terrorist attacks having viewed propaganda videos, including that of Arid Uka, who had killed two US airmen in Germany after having watched what was purported to be footage of US soldiers raping a teenage Muslim girl. It turned out to be a scene from Brian De Palma's anti-war movie Redacted which had been taken out of context.

Oliver Glasgow, a barrister for the government, said the material was shocking and would be used as a ""call to arms"". ""It will be taken up by every jihadist group out there; it will go viral within minutes.""

He also revealed that the government had considered asking that the whole trial be held behind closed doors but had decided it should be heard in open court.

Arguing that the footage should be released – with the soldiers and victim anonymised – Clare Kissen, for the Guardian, Associated Newspapers, the Telegraph Media Group, ITN, BSkyB, News Group Newspapers and Times Newspapers, argued that there was no evidence that releasing the footage would present a ""real and immediate risk to life"".

She said the media wanted access to the footage ""for use in the context of reporting the ongoing trial"". She added: ""The trial proceedings are of clear public interest and reporting and commentary on it involves serious and important questions about the action of service personnel in conflict zones.""

Kissen made it clear that publication of the footage would be subject to media organisations' own policies and regulatory body rules on taste and decency.

The judge advocate general, Jeff Blackett, asked Kissen if she could guarantee that British soldiers would not be killed if the video was released. She replied that she could not, but insisted no ""real and immediate risk"" had been proved – the test relied upon by the government.

Kissen said the court had heard no details of specific threats. Blackett will give his decision on Monday afternoon. The court martial of the marines continues.",Q1
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/09/afghanistan-orders-release-bagram-jail-prisoners,Afghanistan orders release of 72 Bagram jail prisoners,"The Afghan government has ordered the release of 72 prisoners from Bagram jail, despite Washington's insistence that the men were involved in killing dozens of US and Afghan troops and pose a serious threat to the country's security.

The decision adds new strain to Kabul's difficult relationship with Washington. The two countries are already at odds over a draft deal to keep US forces in the country to carry out counter-terrorism operations and train Afghan troops after their combat mission ends this year.

The prisoner release was agreed at a meeting of top judicial officials, chaired by President Hamid Karzai and that included the attorney general and the justice minister.

Karzai had asked the Afghan spy chief to draw up dossiers on the controversial prisoners, but investigations in Kabul and the provinces only turned up solid evidence against 16 of them, the president's spokesman, Aimal Faizi, said. Their cases have been sent to the attorney general's office and will be handled through the legal system.

Of the others, 45 were deemed completely innocent with no evidence emerging against them, Faizi said. The names of the remaining 27 had appeared in files but there was ""nothing direct and concrete"" connecting them with attacks.

""We know there will be disagreements and the Americans will not be happy with this decision, but this is our duty,"" he said.

""We cannot allow innocent Afghan citizens to be kept in detention for months and years without a trial, for no reason at all. We know that unfortunately this has been happening at Bagram, but it is illegal and a violation of Afghan sovereignty.""

The US embassy and Nato forces in Afghanistan did not comment, but they have previously said there is ""ample evidence"" to suspect all the men of a role in attacks that killed or wounded 60 foreign soldiers and 57 Afghans.

DNA and fingerprint evidence links some men to killings, while others were captured with large weapons caches, the military-backed Stars and Stripes newspaper reported.

In the past the US has said that some of the most dangerous prisoners were captured on the basis of intelligence too sensitive to share. Their concerns are also underpinned by a pattern of dangerous fighters being released from jail by the Afghan government and returning to the battlefield.

Among those set free were the deputy Taliban commander for southern Kandahar province, who was released days Canadian forces captured him in 2010. In 2007 a top fighter from western Afghanistan walked out of prison on Karzai's orders, after village elders vouched for him. He was soon uniting feuding insurgent factions, and was personally responsible for the deaths of more than 30 policemen before he was killed in 2009.

The 88 prisoners were among thousands the US once held at Bagram, which was finally transferred to Afghan authorities last March after years of pressure from Karzai.

The terms of the handover were not made public, but were believed to include a tacit Afghan acceptance of the controversial US provision of ""administrative detention"", allowing indefinite imprisonment in cases where classified evidence cannot be presented in court or would not result in a conviction.

Afghanistan has not previously used the system, which has been criticised by human rights groups, and it appears that Karzai and his ministers have now rejected it.

The two governments are already at odds over a bilateral security agreement that would keep US troops in the country for another decade. After the US believed negotiations were finished, and a national assembly of prominent Afghans endorsed the deal at the end of last year, Karzai made new demands and said he was happy to delay signing for months until they were met.

Washington has demanded a speedier decision, and warned that Barack Obama is contemplating a ""zero option"" of taking all troops home, as he did in Iraq. Karzai believes the US will not leave, and is trying to threaten Kabul with the prospect of total departure, Faizi has said.",Q1

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Al-Qaida-still-a-clear-and-present-danger/articleshow/21816103.cms,Al-Qaida still a clear and present danger,"The Arab Spring fooled the West into believing that al-Qaida had become irrelevant — that political Islam could ascend to government — as in Egypt — without resorting to violence. Instead, the Spring turned out to be a springboard for al-Qaida affiliates across West Asia and North Africa.

The al-Qaida threat in Syria is evident — groups like the Jabhat al Nusra and Harakat Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiya aren’t only fighting Bashar Assad, but if Assad were to fall, they’d control Syria’s chemical weapons. But in Pakistan , if al-Qaida affiliates dislodge the state, they could be adding mobile nuclear weapons to their arsenal.

In Pakistan, al-Qaida affiliations run deep. Closest to it is the

Tehreek-e-Taliban

(TTP) Pakistan, which directly threatens the state. Lashkar-e-Taiba , the Haqqani network, Gul Bahadur and Mullah Nazir are more complex. They’re as close to al-Qaida as they are to the establishment, which uses them to attack Afghanistan and India.

Within the past month al-Qaida groups received a boost with almost coincidental jailbreaks in Libya, Iraq and Pakistan sending thousands of jihadi fighters to places like Syria. Nasir al Wuyashi, AQAP’s general manager, promised to free another tranche of jailed militants in Yemen, where the al-Qaida has now struck roots. On July 21, about 500 jihadis were taken out of Iraq’s notorious Abu Ghraib prison, putting a big terror talent pool at the front. On July 30, TTP took out 250 prisoners from a Pakistani jail. On July 28, 1,117 inmates fled Benghazi’s Kuafiya prison in Libya.

Analysts say these are clear signs that TTP is re-grouping with a new generation of more violent, better armed, more committed fighters .

Syria is the new battlefront . Syria & Iraq affiliates have merged to form ISIL (The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), that’s claimed series of bombings across Iraq end of Ramadan.

Not far behind is Egypt and Afghanistan, which will be up for grabs after US troops draw down in 2014. But terror watchers are keeping an eye out for Myanmar as well, where the conflicts between Buddhists and the Rohingyas look ripe to be adopted by global jihad. US president Barack Obama declared last week that Al Qaeda has been degraded. For many living under the shadow of global terror, the threat has only struck distant roots. It remains armed, dangerous, and committed.

A quarter of a century since it came into existence and 15 years after the al-Qaida burst on the scene with the spectacular bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, the outfit continues to be the most powerful driver of global terror. The US, at the vanguard of the fight against this deadly mutating virus, has bled more than $3 trillion over 10 years trying to tame it.Only last week, the US shut down embassies in 19 countries after it intercepted electronic chatter among the group’s core leadership discussing plans for stunning terror strikes. Around the same time, Saudi Arabia arrested two obscure al-Qaida members from Yemen and Chad suspecting them of planning suicide attacks. This was apparently one of the threats that prompted the US to close its missions.The US war on terror, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the drone programme in Pakistan and West Asia have struck deep into the al-Qaida core as we know it. Osama bin Laden ’s May 2011 killing at Abbottabad robbed the movement of the “Sheikh’s” iconic presence and Ayman Al Zawahiri , the new leader, hasn’t yet been able to build the organization the way bin Laden may have wanted it.But the outfit has metastasized into a global network of regional and local terror affiliates . It follows a dual track of local agendas tied to ideologies and goals of a pan-Islamist jihad. Al-Qaida isn’t a physical presence – it’s like a charging station, fusing local grievances with a global terror vision, some say.The al-Qaida functions through affiliates , both autonomous and linked. Their leaders are local men, such as Pakistan’s Bahawal Khan and Mullah Nazir, or Syria’s Al-Amir Gazi al-Haj . These could be groups like Tunisia’s Ansaral Sharia, or Somalia’s Al Shabaab or Ansar Eddine or Boko Haram in Nigeria, Tehreek-e- Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan . All of them function as al-Qaida arms. They wear their affiliation as a badge of honour.These groups have dodged drone strikes to evolve. They use the new media to coordinate strikes. They share resources and suicide attackers, build weapons, move fighters from distant countries to fight local wars. Ibrahim Al Asiri, al-Qaida’s maker of the underwear bomb, is a case in point. He’s believed to have created a liquid explosive gel – dip your clothes into it and they become bombs. Airport security can’t sniff these IEDs.“Al-Qaida adapted after the Arab uprisings, and was never really marginalized. It views some countries as being in a preparatory phase, where Salafi jihadist ideas can be propagated through dawa, or missionary work, as in Tunisia. Other countries are viewed as open fields of confrontation. The bottom line is that the world has changed. Al-Qaida has sought to adapt to these changes, and in many cases Western analysts were slow to discern how it was doing so.” Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, says.",Q1
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25007379,"Afghan refugees in Iran face abuse, says HRW","In its report, HRW says Iranian officials ""have in recent years limited legal avenues for Afghans to claim refugee or other immigration status in Iran, even as conditions in Afghanistan have deteriorated"".

Iran's home office says that around two-thirds of the Afghans resident there are illegal immigrants.

""Iran is deporting thousands of Afghans to a country where the danger is both real and serious,"" said Joe Stork from HRW's Middle East division.

""Iran has an obligation to hear these people's refugee claims rather than sweeping them up and tossing them over the border to Afghanistan.""

HRW said it had evidence of violations including physical abuse, detention in unsanitary and inhumane conditions, forced labour and separation of families.

Last year the Iranian government passed a law that restricts residence permits to those Afghan immigrants who live in three of Iran's 31 provinces.

In November, it ordered 300,000 Afghans living in the country on temporary permits to leave, HRW said, adding that so far the plan had not been implemented.

HRW said the Iranian government's policies meant many undocumented Afghan children could not go to school, and migrants recognised as refugees were limited to ""dangerous and poorly paid"" manual labour jobs.

And the group warned of rising anti-foreigner sentiment in Iran which was leaving the Afghan population at risk of physical violence.",Q1
http://www.minnpost.com/christian-science-monitor/2013/07/australia-ends-asylum-boat-begins-debate-over-racism,"Australia ends asylum by boat, begins debate over racism","She is clearly distraught. Holding her head in her hands, the young Iranian asylum seeker sobs inconsolably. A male companion puts an arm on her shoulder to comfort her as she comes to terms with the news that she will never be resettled in Australia.

The photograph, taken earlier this week by Australian immigration officials, is being used as part of a government campaign aimed at deterring others like her from undertaking the perilous journey fromIndonesia to Christmas Island to seek refugee status in Australia.

Last week Australia introduced the most draconian measures yet to stop the hundreds of people arriving by boat every week from countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sri Lanka. From now on all boat arrivals are to be sent the Manus Island detention center in Papua New Guinea. Those found to be refugees will be settled there, those who do not meet refugee status requirements will be sent back to their country of origin.

In a blunt message to people smugglers when announcing what has been dubbed the “PNG solution,” Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said: “Your business model is over.”

But some worry that moving so ruthlessly to neutralize one of Australia’s most divisive political issues tarnishes the country’s reputation as a model liberal society. Since World War II, Australia has successfully settled more than 7 million migrants – among them hundreds of thousands of refugees.

“With a cruel but politically brilliant stroke, Rudd has ended this bigger and more noble national idea of ourselves. We are firmly back in the bounded national community,” says former Australian ambassador to Cambodia and author of a number of books on asylum seekers, Tony Kevin.

The unnamed Iranian woman in the photo, her features blurred to protect her identity, has become an unlikely ambassador for critics of the government who fear that the demonizing of refugees signals a return to the overt racism encapsulated in the country’s notorious “White Australia” policy.

Introduced at the beginning of the last century, the White Australia policy was designed to shut the door to Chinese miners and cheap labor from the South Pacific. The policy with its stress on assimilation was gradually dismantled in the 1970s in favor of a more inclusive model of multiculturalism where migrants were encouraged to maintain their ethnic and cultural identities as long as they adhered to basic social and legal norms.

The policy was put to the test following the end of the war in Vietnam when the first boat filled with Vietnamese asylum seekers arrived in Darwin Harbor in early 1976. “If we were ever threatened, that was then,” says Neville Roach, a former chair of the National Multicultural Advisory Council. “There were a million or more people in refugee camps in South East Asia and we were the closest country that could take them. Yet by coming up with a very positive regional solution we managed the crisis.”

Under that regional framework, Australia took more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees from camps in Guam, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, while the United States and Canada took thousands more.

Today’s asylum seekers

But today’s asylum seeker crisis is very different. Barely 2,000 Vietnamese made it by boat to Australia in the 1970s. This year that number has been exceeded almost every month. The bipartisanship of those times has been replaced by an acrimonious political debate and countries like Indonesia are proving harder to co-opt when it comes to finding a regional solution.

“The current political rhetoric has been giving the term ‘regional solution’ a bad name,” says Mr. Roach. “Australia as the richest country in the region should contribute financially to help South East Asian countries process the refugees and even accept some. This time we’re only talking about 100,000 or so, a number that can easily be accommodated across the region.”

For workers on the frontline like Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Melbourne, which provides resettlement services, there has been a discernible hardening of attitudes toward asylum seekers. “The [Afghan] Hazaras I work with are reporting being attacked on the streets. They are afraid of catching the trains.”

Ms. Curr blames the politicians for “constantly fanning the flames of conflict and fear” in the community over the asylum issue. “They are shredding our social fabric, pitting one ethnic group against another. We’ve done well for a frontier settlement – a new country – but we’ve destroyed a lot of that.”

Traces of racism?

Melbourne has only recently recovered from the opprobrium associated with a rash of attacks on Indian students that peaked in 2008 and 2009. The attacks were branded by sections of the Indian media as being racially motivated.

But a 2011 study by the Australian Institute of Criminology determined that race played little or no role. It found that many Indian students were more vulnerable to assaults because they often worked in late-night service jobs such as taxi driving, working in gas stations and convenience stores.

While Australians have largely welcomed the contribution migrants have made to Australian society, attitudes toward boat arrivals and Muslims have hardened in recent years.

A survey published by Scanlon Foundation at Melbourne’s Monash University last year found that only 22 percent of Australians believed asylum seekers arriving by boat should be given the chance to permanently settle, while 23 percent thought “turning back the boats” is the best policy. The survey also found that 25 percent had a negative attitude toward Iraqis and Lebanese specifically.

Neville Roach fears that the current debate over asylum seekers will undermine community tolerance of outsiders even further. “I am surprised by how rapidly attitudes have changed,” he says.

Meanwhile the government’s PNG solution is already coming under strain. There has been no let up in the number of boats leaving Java bound for Christmas Island. Nor has it prevented deaths at seas. At least nine asylum seekers drowned on Wednesday when a boat carrying up to 200 people started to take on water southwest of Java.

“What we can see in this policy is another in a very long line of policies that’s designed to provide a very quick fix to what is in essence a very complex global phenomenon,” says Michelle Foster, director of the International Refugee Law Research Program at Melbourne Law School.",Q1

Their arrival home marked the end of the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team's decade-long work in the Bamiyan Province.

When the Kiwi soldiers arrived in 2003, Taleban rule meant girls were banned from school.

Now, half of all pupils are girls and Minister of Defence, Dr Jonathan Coleman, is confident the Afghan authorities are well-placed to continue the good work of the New Zealand troops.

Seeing the smiles of happy school children meant that it was easier for the likes of Twamley to get through his gruelling deployment.

He left New Zealand on October 3, just five days after baby Alex was born.

His partner, Jessica Hanright, 24, said life as a new mum was tough at times.

But she said today would be like meeting his daughter ""for the first time"", and expects he'll have to ease into the relationship with his first child.

Twamley 's father Grant, from Ashburton, said he was ""flaming proud"" of his son and believes the Bamiyan people will be sad at the Kiwi departure. ""I just hope all their hard work pays off,"" he said.

Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Sholto Stephens, was confident the Bamiyan police, who have worked with New Zealand forces for a decade, are well-equipped to continue the work his men had done.

""We're pretty chuffed with what we've achieved,"" he said.

So was Eleisha Telford, a 20-year-old hairdresser from Christchurch, who's been counting down the days, waiting for partner Dylan Glover to come home.

‘Suspect is down in the second-floor bedroom,’ one SWAT officer radioed.

Thomas Andrew Hripto, 37, reported AWOL from the Pennsylvania National Guard, was dead on his bedroom floor with an apparent gunshot wound.

There were no reports of police returning gunfire after the initial reported gunshot.

The Montgomery County Coroner’s Office has not released Hripto’s cause or manner of death but it appears that Hripto’s gunshot wound was self-inflicted.

Although the circumstances of what may have transpired to lead to Hripto’s death may never be fully known, he stands as the latest reminder that suicide in the military remains an issue the U.S. is struggling to resolve.

‘It’s been growing and rising over the past decade or so, increasing since 2004,’ said Craig J. Bryan, the associate director of the National Center for Veteran Studies. ‘Traditionally, the military suicide rate has been lower than the civilian rate. If you were in the military, you were protected, so to speak. We saw the trend start to change.’

In a statement before the House of Representatives’ military personnel subcommittee, Jacqueline Garrick, the director of the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, said the suicide rate in the military increased from 10.3 per 100,000 service members in 2000 to 18.3 in 2009. While the rate essentially remained level in 2010 and 2011, she said they believed it would jump for 2012 once the numbers were in.

According to a story from the Associated Press, 349 service members killed themselves in 2012, exceeding combat deaths in Afghanistan by more than 50.

Numbers seem to vary, as the Los Angeles Times cited more than 500 military suicides in 2012.

The AP also said the number of deaths increased from 301 in 2011, though it remains to be seen how that affects the rates Garrick cited.

There is no word yet on 2013’s numbers, but the problem is becoming more and more recognized.

The Department of Defense even has a special webpage dealing with the subject.

*** Hripto served as a specialist in the 28th Infantry Division and had a deployment to Kosovo from 2003 to 2004 as a part of his unit’s NATO peacekeeping mission, according to Staff Sgt. Matt Jones, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania National Guard.

Additionally, Hripto was deployed in relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina, Jones said.

It was unclear exactly what Hripto’s duties were in either deployment but neither area was considered a combat assignment.

However, it appears that whether a service member is deployed into combat doesn’t matter, according to suicide figures.

According to a Los Angeles Times story by Alan Zarembo, roughly half of suicides in the military actually involve troops not assigned to combat. It’s even possible the slight majority, 52 percent, of military suicides are from those not involved in combat roles.

‘The reality and some of the research we’re doing now is finding that a lot of the experiences that military personnel have in these non-combat roles are still extremely emotionally devastating,’ Bryan said.

Even in humanitarian missions, Bryan said service members deployed are handling death or ‘intense human suffering’ most would never encounter.

‘It’s not what we tend to think of with combat,’ Bryan said. ‘Research shows it causes significant psychological distress…I think that’s probably why we fail to see a relationship between combat exposure and suicide predicated on this false sense that no stress, no trauma, no atrocity, et cetera’ is experienced by those in non-combat roles.

Bryan said it’s similar to what police, fire and other emergency personnel experience.

*** Pottstown resident Todd Boothe was a specialist in the Army who returned from combat in Afghanistan in December 2011.

He said he had a ‘tough time’ when he first got home dealing with the stress from his deployment during which he was involved in a roadside explosion and lost three sergeants in his unit.

With the military putting extra emphasis on ‘resiliency’ training to help troops manage stress, Boothe said he was in classes before and after his deployment.

‘We went through more stress classes going to Afghanistan than coming back,’ Boothe said.

He said he thought the classes helped a little but the high stress he experienced while being deployed still left its mark.

Bryan said it might be too early to judge exactly how well the resiliency classes are working to curtail military suicide, using the analogy of exercise and heart disease.

‘Exercising is very good, but there’s no magic amount that’ll keep you from having heart disease,’ he said. ‘That’s the best way to think about it. Probably yes, they do help, but we can’t know for sure.’

‘I can’t help but wonder if we were not doing them would it be worse,’ Bryan added.

*** The biggest thing to consider in sucide prevention is trying to ‘think like service members,’ Bryan said.

‘They spend their lives or their careers within the military culture and then they transition back,’ Bryan said. ‘They don’t feel like they fit in and others don’t understand them and understand their experience.’Montgomery County Prothonotary records show that Hripto had two active Municipal Liens on his house on Lynn Drive. The Lower Pottsgrove Township Authority filed the most recent lien on June 25, one day after his alleged drunk-driving charges from Washington County became active.

Neighbors interviewed by The Mercury during the incident on July 10 said Hripto was the only person they saw coming and going from the two-story home, and that he kept to himself.

‘Once you live the lifestyle, if you like the military, you really like the lifestyle,’ Boothe said. ‘But you have to come back to reality. Some people can’t do that.’

Upon returning, Boothe admitted having a little trouble adjusting to civilians, including his family.

One of the biggest things that helped him was attending weekly sessions in at the Southeastern Veterans’ Center with other veterans to talk through their experiences.

‘We sit around and talk about what happened,’ Boothe said. ‘It took me a while to open up.’

Once he did, he said things got a lot better and he’s attended the sessions regularly.

‘Collectiveness and belongingness is a major factor in emotional distress and suicide risk,’ Bryan said.

As a culture, Bryan said the U.S. needs to take more responsibility in its military and the issues its service members have, whether they’ve fired machine guns in Fallujah or helped disperse food in Haiti following its devastating earthquake.

According to a 2003 article in the military newspaper, Stars and Stripes, Hripto’s divison was, ‘The most-deployed National Guard division,’ at the time.

‘It’s very easy and common to say what the military should do,’ Bryan said. ‘It’s better to ask, ‘What are we going to do with this societal mental health problem?”

Although the numbers look bleak, Bryan said he does see things getting better in the future.

‘I do feel confident it will eventually get better,’ Bryan said, citing the near completion of the first treatment study involving military service members.

With the completion of that, some treatment options will become available to better treat those who may be having difficulties in the military.

Once the investigation into his death is concluded, Hripto’s name may be added to the list of military suicides.

As awareness grows and better treatments are developed, there is a hope that that trend may reverse.

http://www.khaama.com/us-military-halt-logistic-support-to-some-afghan-military-units-2590,US military halt logistic support to some Afghan military units,"The US military in Afghanistan has scaled back logistics supports including fuel delivery and supply to a number of Afghan national army and Afghan police forces military units.

Afghan defense and interior ministry officials said Sunday that the step by US military has disturb the Afghan national security forces routine operations.

While speaking during the national security council meeting chaired by president Hamid Karzai, defense and interior ministry officials said that the US military in a number of caes, has stopped fuel delivery and supply, and support services to some military units.

The national security council of Afghanistan reviewed the reports presented by defense and interior ministry, and called the step by US military and NATO forces against the previous commitments by the alliance towards the Afghan security forces, the presidential palace said in a statement.

The statement also added that the members of the national security council of Afghanistan called the step by US military to halt fuel delivery and supply and support to Afghan national security forces, an act to put pressure on the government of Afghanistan to sign the bilateral security agreement.

National security council members also insisted that the bilateral security agreement between the two nations can only be signed through mutual cooperation and not through pressures, presidential palace added in its statement.

In the meantime, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) following a statement said, “There has been no stoppage in the delivery of requested fuel and we continue to process all orders as soon as they are received from the ANSF. We remain committed to supporting our ANSF partners and will continue to do so.”",Q1
http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/afghan-taliban-suspends-talks-with-u-s-over-captive-soldier-1.2548124,"Afghan Taliban kill 21 soldiers, suspend prisoner swap attempt","The Afghan Taliban killed 21 soldiers in an assault on Sunday in a remote mountainous region, the Afghan government said, and six soldiers were missing after the militants' most deadly assault on the security forces in months.

Also on Sunday, in a possible blow to U.S. efforts to foster peace talks to end the Afghan conflict, the Taliban said they had suspended efforts to arrange a possible exchange of Taliban and U.S. prisoners due to the ""complexity"" of the situation.

It was not immediately clear whether the attack in the eastern province of Kunar was related to the suspension of talks on a prisoner swap.

In response to the killings in Kunar, a mountainous region bordering Pakistan that has long been a stronghold of the Taliban, al Qaeda, and other militants, President Hamid Karzai put off a trip to Sri Lanka.

""The Afghan president is saddened by this tragic incident, and therefore he postponed today's official trip to Sri Lanka,"" Karzai's office said in a statement.

Government officials said 21 soldiers were killed and three were wounded in the attack on an army checkpoint in Kunar's Ghaziabad district. Six remained missing, they said.

The government sent reinforcements to the area where the pre-dawn attack took place, Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi said in a statement.

The Taliban appeared to have been waiting for them. Azimi said the reinforcements ""came under enemy attack, and a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near them"". The suicide bomber did not kill any Afghan soldiers, Azimi said.

In a possible reference to al Qaeda or other militants who might not be part of the Afghan Taliban, Azimi also told Reuters that ""foreign fighters"" had taken part in the attack.

The Afghan Taliban, in a statement emailed to media, claimed responsibility for the attack. Local officials in Kunar said three insurgents were killed.

Sunday's assault was the worst since last September, when the Taliban attacked a convoy of Afghan forces in relatively peaceful northern Badakhshan province, killing at least 18.

The attack took place as U.S. and NATO forces withdraw from Afghanistan ahead a year-end deadline, shifting the bulk of the fight against Taliban and other militants to Afghans.

While Afghanistan's police and army are seen as having made big strides in their capabilities, doubts remain about whether they can keep the Taliban at bay, especially in remote areas like Ghaziabad.

It remains unclear if the United States and allied nations will keep a small force in Afghanistan after 2014 to support Afghan forces and go after al Qaeda, due to Karzai's refusal so far to sign a pact authorizing a future troop presence.

Karzai urged neighbouring Pakistan, where Afghan and U.S. officials say Taliban and other militants are able to resupply and plot attacks, to help it fight militants.

""The President once again calls on the government of Pakistan to earnestly and sincerely cooperate with a strong will with Afghanistan and to take serious and effective measures in eliminating the terrorist sanctuaries that have continued to pose a grave and serious threat to both the countries,"" his office said in its statement.

Peace talks in doubt

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid announced that the group's reclusive leadership, believed to be based in Pakistan, had suspended attempts to arrange an exchange of senior Taliban locked up for years in a U.S. prison for a U.S. soldier in militant custody.

U.S. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is seen in a frame grab from a video released by the Taliban in 2010. (IntelCenter/The Associated Press, file) In an effort to foster peace talks, U.S. officials recently took steps they hoped might revive U.S. discussions with Taliban representatives about the proposed transfer of up to five Taliban detainees out of Guantanamo Bay prison in exchange for the return of Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier who went missing in Afghanistan in 2009 and is believed to be held by Taliban-linked militants in northwest Pakistan.

""Due to the political complexity of the current situation in the country, the leadership of the Islamic Emirate has decided to suspend the issue for some time,"" Mujahid said, using the name the Taliban gave their 1996-2001 government.

""Therefore, the prisoner exchange process has been delayed until further notice,"" Mujahid said. He provided no further detail on why the decision had been made.

U.S. officials have long hoped such an exchange would not only free the only U.S. soldier to remain missing in the Afghanistan war, but would also be a step toward launching more substantive peace talks.

Robert Hilton, a spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Kabul, declined to discuss specifics.

""As we have said before, Sergeant Bergdahl has been gone far too long and we continue to call for his immediate release,"" Hilton said.

The Taliban statement comes as Karzai's government seeks to kindle direct talks of its own with Taliban officials.

Afghanistan's High Peace Council, a government body established to seek a political end to the war, said in a statement late on Saturday that a delegation led by Karzai aide Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai had met four senior ""Taliban representatives"" in Dubai last week.

The Taliban leadership has denied it authorized any of its members to participate in recent Dubai discussions and, in a statement last week, reiterated its opposition to holding talks with Karzai's government, which it deems illegitimate.",Q1

http://www.mercurynews.com/rss/ci_24518774,Cupertino Veterans Day celebration salutes women in military,"For the seventh consecutive year, the Cupertino community came together on one day of the year, in one place and at one time to say “thank you.”

The city held its annual Veterans Day celebration in the city’s picturesque Memorial Park. The event held beside the Cupertino Veterans Memorial has become an annual magnet for veterans and patriots from not just Cupertino but the region at large.

Former mayor Sandra James, CEO of the nonprofit Cupertino Veterans Memorial, has worked with event organizers to have a special emphasis or message each year.

This year saw a tribute to women in the military. The Nov. 11 ceremony highlighted the contributions of women throughout history who have served, from civilian contributions in both World Wars to the women who serve and fight alongside men today.

Keynote speakers retired Coast Guard Vice Adm. Jody Breckenridge and Master Chief Lelani Cale-Jones of the Coast Guard spoke of the significance of women in the military and noted a generation of women who have served in uniform.

“They did not seek the limelight, but it did seek them, often putting them under the microscope, and whether fair or not, it was a reality,” Breckenridge said of early military volunteers in the 1970s.

Keynote speakers also included retired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Ostenberg and retired Navy SEAL Lt. Kaj Larsen. Ostenberg shared a history of how veterans have been honored since the end of World War II, noting the vast changes in public perception toward honoring veterans after World War II, the Vietnam War and current conflicts.

“With each passing day, their shadow grows longer from that generation. They are still examples to us all,” he said.

A key theme for the day was service and sacrifice, for those both in and out of uniform.

“Sometimes that sacrifice is relatively small, and I use that term relatively because it is still significant,” Mayor Orrin Mahoney said. “They may sacrifice a career where they started later, they may sacrifice starting a family or sacrifice seeing their family growing up. Those of them that have gone off to experience combat make a far more serious sacrifice.”

The approximately two-hour ceremony was held in front of the veterans memorial’s centerpiece sculpture The Guardians, which features the image of two watchful soldiers back to back. The two soldiers represented are Cupertino’s own Matthew Axelson and James Suh of Florida, two Navy SEALs who died fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan during Operation Red Wings in June 2005.

Though few in attendance personally knew Axelson or Suh, the annual ceremony provides stories and clues about the men from those who knew or served alongside the duo. Lt. Larsen provided stories this year about what it was like going through SEAL training with both men. Larsen, who grew up in Santa Cruz, shared stories of how Axelson and Suh would give up valuable and crucial time to help others succeed in some of the most physically hellish and academically challenging moments in their training days.

As the stories concluded, Larsen came close to tears as he remembered hearing of Axelson and Suh’s deaths.

“In their final moments of service, both of my friends were still serving others,” he said. “Matt and James, I miss you guys every day.”

The spotlight on women in the military continued a tradition of singling out a group of veterans for extra recognition. Last year saw a tribute to veterans from the Korean War. In 2010, there was a salute to World War II veterans and 2011 saw a tribute to Vietnam veterans, which included bringing a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall to Memorial Park.

Near the ceremony’s conclusion, a new memorial boulder was unveiled as a dedication to all women who have served and are serving in the military. Women today make up 14 percent of the military, with more than 165,000 women enlisted and more than 35,000 additional women serving as officers, according to event organizers.",Q1
http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/13597,Cinematic Apartheid vs. Righteous Artists of our Time,"Why did Haifa’s International Film Festival wish to honor filmmaker Mira Nair for her film “The Reluctant Fundamentalist”? The film is just another exceptionally well done piece of anti-American propaganda which justifies Islamic/Islamist terrorism by showing us that America harasses Muslims constantly, even Muslims as brilliant and assimilated as Nair’s “fundamentalist” hero, Changez. According to Nair, America is to blame for Pakistani fundamentalist terrorism.

Did the Haifa Film mavens really screen this film? If they did, how could they miss Nair’s agenda? Why would they wish to honor one more film that depicts America, the CIA, and American military forces as cruel, evil, and racist and which glorifies the offended dignity of innocent Muslims as a way of justifying the nihilistic terror that Muslims are unleashing, globally, first against other Muslims, second, against infidels. Remember Syriana (2005), Paradise Now (2005), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Babel (2006), The Kingdom (2007), Rendition (2007), and Amreeka (2009)?

What is wrong with the film mavens who live in Haifa, a jewel of a Jewish city and one with a large Arab Muslim and Arab Christian population? Haifa is a genuinely mutli-ethnic and multi-racial abode. No city in Israel is an “apartheid” city, but Haifa is exceptionally integrated in terms of its demographics. There is nothing like it in Gaza and there will be nothing like it in Judea and Samaria if the world prevails and ethnically cleanses Jews from their historically Jewish land.

This is truly heartbreaking: The so-called progressives and leftists—the “good” people—want to ethnically cleanse the “occupied West Bank” and East Jerusalem of its Jews—and all in the name of anti-racism. They do not demand that Arabs, including the new ones on the block, the Palestinian Arabs, allow Jews--not even the 800,000 Arab Jews who were forced to flee Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, the Maghreb--after centuries of persecution, to become citizens or even live in any of their twenty two countries.

The Arab and Muslim world is almost entirely “judenrein,” cleansed of Arab Jews, and they are persecuting and cleansing themselves of their Christian Arabs; and yet, the “good people” still insist that such Muslim racists and ideologues are the victims, the underdogs, provoked by white—dare I write “Zionist”?-- colonialism into becoming fundamentalist terrorists.

Just like Mira Nair’s very sympathetic leading character Changez.

Pnina Blair, the artistic director of the Haifa Film Festival has been quoted in Haaretz as saying that she opposed cultural boycotts of any kind and that the festival “is an exemplar of pluralism and coexistence and our program reflects this approach.”

I agree with her and yet while she and I may oppose boycotts, clearly Mira Nair believes in them. Blair’s high-minded statement is toothless, perhaps even too Christ-like for me. It is downright dangerous for a Jew to turn the other cheek: Remember what the Romans did to Jesus and to 100,000 other Jews.

I am certainly not suggesting that Jews become as sadistic or as genocidal as our enemies are—but when they are trying to kill you, I would recommend self-defense, not appeasement by film award. And, as they say, when the one and only Jewish state is utterly surrounded and the entire world is calling for its death, playing offense is a wise form of self-defense.

Yes, of course, progressive Israelis and Jews the world over want to practice the Jewish ethics which Jews developed in exile and for which we are known. Jews do not wish to do to someone else what is hateful to them; we wish to improve the world, we hear the stranger’s cry as well as our own cry; we wish to be accepted among the nations of the world; we wish to live in peace and harmony under our vines and fig trees.

But do we wish to be defamed year after year? Do we wish to live with the consequences of such defamation which are none other than righteous hatred, increasing isolation, and then extermination?

Mira Nair has just defamed Haifa and all Israel. She has been quoted as saying: “I will go to Israel when the occupation is gone…when the state does not privilege one religion over another. I will go to Israel when Apartheid is over.” She has tweeted that she supports “Palestine for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel and the larger Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, (BDS) Mov’t.”

Why honor such a person? Especially since her film is only a deft and emotionally dangerous piece of propaganda? Clearly, Nair cannot see the elephant in the room: Islamic and Arab gender and religious apartheid.

In the last decade, I have written about twenty articles about high profile academics, public intellectuals, actors, activists, musicians, and artists who have signed petitions against Israel (only); tried to join flotillas filled with Turkish assassins; have voted for academic boycotts of left wing Israeli academics; etc.

Yes, some of the boycotters are great filmmakers—like Sweden’s Lukas Moodyson—who have followed the herd of Big Liars and Defamers. Moodyson’s film, Lilya-4-ever, is about the sex trafficking of girls and women from Russia and into Sweden. Progressive Israelis were holding a conference against trafficking and wanted to show his film. In 2003, when I wrote about his refusal to allow them to do so on a one-time basis, he contacted me privately, enraged, but partly because he was also familiar with my work, he engaged with what I had written. Within 48 hours, Moodyson decided to allow his film to be shown in Israel.

I am not going to name the names of those who believe it is fashionable and acceptable, even brave, to “beat up on the Jew;” those who glorify killers and believe it is romantic to do so. They are common conformists, ignorant about history and reality, unable to think independently or clearly. They are also cowards who cannot withstand the peer pressure, the orchestrated and personalized internet campaigns, and the death threats which come their way when they plan to perform in Israel. They are artists who, I have been told, cannot resist the pressure of one phone call from Bishop Desmond Tutu, who routinely calls to persuade popular artists and public intellectuals not to go to Israel.

Here, I will name the names of some of the very popular musicians who resisted the pressure and chose to perform in Israel. They are our Righteous Artists.

http://www.nwaonline.com/news/2013/aug/12/call-it-terrorism-20130812/?opinion,Call it terrorism,"In November 2009, my Army Reserve Medical Detachment reported to Fort Hood, Texas, in preparation for deployment to Afghanistan. As we waited in line at the base’s processing center, Major Nidal Hasan entered the building and fired rounds that would kill 13 people and an unborn child and wound 32 others, including me. After many setbacks, Hasan’s trial finally began last week.

On the day of the attack, I was waiting for a medical exam before what would have been my third deployment overseas. I was texting my wife when I heard the shout of “Allahu Akbar!”

The bullets narrowly missed my heart, but one lodged in my liver. I still have two bullets in my body and deal with near-constant pain in my legs and back.

During my recovery, I learned that the Army had classified the shooting as non-political workplace violence instead of a terrorist attack. The language used to describe the attack may seem meaningless, but it is very meaningful to the victims and their families.

Because the Army decided that our wounds were not “combat-related,” a number of benefits are being denied to the victims and their families, including certain health and disability ones. In some instances, the designation even resulted in victims receiving smaller salaries than we would have received during our deployment. As a reservist, I was making roughly $2,000 per month less than I would have in my private sector job. The Army would have made up that difference had I been on deployment orders or had my injuries classified as combat-related.

Unfortunately, I am not alone in my experience. I have watched other victims and their families be denied disability benefits and treated indifferently by the Army.

But it would be a mistake to think that the terrorism designation is just about benefits. It is also about the government acknowledging its complicity in the attack.

Before the shooting, the Army knew that the gunman was an Islamic religious extremist. After the attack, a bipartisan Senate report concluded that the Defense Department had evidence that “Hasan embraced views so extreme that it should have disciplined him or discharged him from the military, but DoD failed to take action against him.”

The FBI knew that Hasan was emailing with known terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki, asking questions about religious martyrdom and expressing support for al-Awlaki’s terrorist tactics. It did nothing.

The Army also knew that Hasan was an incompetent psychiatrist who repeatedly neglected his duties. Yet instead of investigating, disciplining or discharging him, they transferred him to my medical detachment for deployment to Afghanistan.

Hasan’s conviction would represent one step on the path toward justice. But that journey won’t be complete until the government tells the truth about the attack, provides proper support for its victims and takes measures to ensure that these mistakes won’t happen again.

The Islamic State group had claimed responsibility for the attack in the northern district of Panchagarh, but authorities blamed militants from Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). ""The court... sentenced all four to death over the murder. They are JMB members,"" Abdur Rafique, a court official in the capital Dhaka, told AFP.

The priest was a prominent member of Bangladesh’s Hindu community, which makes up nearly 10 percent of the South Asian country’s population of 168 million.

JMB was blamed for the murders of minorities, secular writers, publishers and foreigners between 2013 and 2016. Among them was a savage attack at a Dhaka cafe in 2016 that killed 22 people, mostly foreigners.

Seven extremists were sentenced to death in November over the assault that was claimed by the IS. Bangladesh security forces launched a nationwide crackdown after the cafe siege, killing more than 100 members of the JMB including its top leaders, and arresting hundreds of suspected militants.",Q1

CNN —

The White House confirms that Syria has crossed a “red line” by using chemical weapons in its war with rebel forces, prompting the United States to boost the “scale and scope” of its support for the opposition.

The determination, disputed by Syria, comes as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have made gains in the past few weeks. Also, the militant group Hezbollah has become more active in the fighting on behalf of the regime.

The opposition has warned it could face crippling losses without immediate support.

What’s next?

The Obama administration was resisting calls to arm the rebels, worried in part about the influence of radical groups and that weaponry might wind up in the wrong hands.

But it has now changed course.

It is going to provide military support including small arms, ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to the rebels, according to two officials familiar with the matter. The weapons will be provided by the CIA, the officials said.

The White House said earlier said no decision had been made on whether to impose a “no-fly” zone. That is something rebels have said is needed to halt air attacks on their strongholds.

The United States has also ruled out sending troops, or putting “boots on the ground” in Syria.

What’s been the U.S. response?

The Obama administration had previously authorized non-lethal assistance, including communications equipment, medical supplies and food. The first direct U.S. support arrived in March.

Obama signed off on a new package of non-lethal aid April. That assistance was expected to include body armor, night-vision goggles and other military equipment.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also ordered the deployment of up to 200 additional U.S. troops to Jordan in April as the violence spreads from adjacent Syria.

Those forces included communications and intelligence specialists aimed at assisting the Jordanians and “be ready for military action” if Obama were to order it, a Defense Department official said.

A number of U.S. special forces troops have been in Jordan for the past year assisting that nation’s the Jordanians.

Jordan is a crucial U.S. ally in the Middle East and has experienced an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the fighting in Syria.

The United States is also deploying a Patriot anti-missile battery and F-16 aircraft to Jordan as part of military exercises taking place this month.

It is not clear whether any of those assets will remain in Jordan once the regional exercises are complete. The Syrians possess Scud missiles.

The United States also has deployed Patriot missiles to Turkey, which also borders Syria. Officials say those missiles are defensive in nature. Syria employs SCUD rockets.

Would NATO join the U.S.?

Questions still remain about whether NATO would assist the U.S. militarily, similar to its help in enforcing a “no-fly” zone over Libya during that country’s period of civil unrest.

In the past, NATO has flatly ruled out military intervention and the United States has no plans to put boots on the ground.

But on Friday, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the international community had made clear that any use of chemical weapons is “completely unacceptable and a clear breach of international law.”

Speaking in Brussels, he said he welcomed “the clear U.S. statement” on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons use and that it was a matter of great concern.

“As for NATO, the Patriot deployment will ensure effective protection for Turkey against any missile attack, whether the missiles carry chemical weapons or not,” he said.

Additional military options?

• Targeting Syria’s air defenses with Patriot missile batteries in Turkey as part of a “no-fly” response, NATO has said. But Turkey only allowed the missiles there for defensive purposes and NATO nations would have to agree before they could be used otherwise.

• Airstrikes: The U.S. military has enough air power in the region to take action against Syria, according to officials. That includes fighter jets and bombers spread out across air bases in the Middle East and nearby aircraft carriers. The Navy also has warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles, which could be used to hit chemical weapons supplies.

But such strikes pose a danger of releasing chemical agents into the air around civilian populations in Syria, U.S. officials told CNN in March.

Complicating military involvement

What complicates any U.S. military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al Qaeda sympathies, the same stripe of militants America has battled in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In April, Hagel cautioned lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee about the difficulties surrounding any direct U.S. military action in Syria.

“It could embroil the United States in a significant, lengthy and uncertain military commitment,” he said.

He called military intervention “an option but an option of last resort.”

Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the United States could send troops to Syria if al-Assad’s government fell, if needed, to secure chemical weapons.",Q1

KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 7 (UPI) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel arrived in Afghanistan Saturday amid continuing diplomatic fencing over keeping U.S. troops in the country past 2014. During his unannounced visit, Hagel is not expected to meet with President Hamid Karzai, but will talk with Afghanistan's defense and interior ministers, the Washington Post reported. Advertisement

The lack of an official nod to the Afghan president appears to suggest U.S. officials believe Karzai is not likely to relent any time soon on last-minute demands he wants met before agreeing to sign a security agreement.

Hagel is also expected to meet with U.S. troops, the Pentagon said in a statement.

Hagel is the latest senior U.S. official to visit the country in recent weeks, Khaama Press reported.

Earlier this week, U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Jim Dobbins reported Karzai had not backed off demands that include releasing all Afghans held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison camp and ending all strikes in the country.

The stalled agreement comes in advance of Afghan presidential elections and the drawdown of foreign troops in the coming year. Lack of an agreement could threaten international support for Afghanistan during that crucial period, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said during a visit to Kabul last month.

ISLAMABAD, March 25 (KUNA) -- In an incident of violence, militants launched a gun and suicide attack on an Afghan election commission office in the capital Afghan city Kabul, said police.

Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Estanakzai said, ""A suicide bomber blew himself up at the gate of an Independent Election Commission (IEC) regional office in Darulaman, and then several other attackers entered the building."" The attack came just two weeks before the presidential polls where Taliban rebels have vowed a campaign of violence to disrupt the ballot on April 5.

According to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi, two civilians wounded in the attack had been taken to hospital. IEC spokesman Noor Mohammad Noor said security forces had told them that their office might be the target of the attack. He added, ""We have spoken to our staff in that office, they are all fine and are in their bunkers."" The blasts occurred in western Darulaman area of the Afghan capital close to the home of Ashraf Ghani, who is seen as a frontrunner in the race to succeed President Hamid Karzai. The other leading presidential candidates are Abdullah Abdullah, who came second in 2009 polls and former foreign minister Zalmai Rassoul.

The numbers of violent incidents have increased as presidential polls get closer and election campaigns of the candidates are in full swing. Earlier on Thursday, four gunmen stormed Kabul's Serena hotel and shot dead nine civilians including an Agence France-Presse journalist.

Clement was accused of not properly supervising the Marines who urinated on the corpses in 2011, but Glueck’s order did not explain why the case was being dropped, The Washington Times reports.

Instead, Glueck ordered that Clement face an administrative board of inquiry, which will determine if he will be retained or separated from the Marine Corps over less than honorable conditions for the alleged misconduct.

Clement’s attorneys had earlier won a judge’s order for two attorneys to testify in court over accusations that senior Marine commanders had interfered in the case proceedings, The Washington Times reports. That hearing, which was scheduled for Wednesday, will no longer take place.

http://nypost.com/2014/01/31/obama-giving-up-on-afghanistan/,Obama giving up on Afghanistan?,"With one word, “if,” President Obama this week raised the fear that America’s gains in Afghanistan will go down the drain, as they did in Iraq.

True: Afghanistan is no Iraq. After all, as Obama’s told us time and again, the latter was a terrible blunder while the former was “the good war.”

That’s why, at the end of his first year as president, Obama ordered (albeit unenthusiastically, according to his defense secretary at the time, Bob Gates) an Afghan “surge” of 30,000 troops.

Yet their successes, hard won with blood and guts, could well be reversed now, as Afghan President Hamid Karzai refuses to sign an agreement that his own government negotiated with Washington last year.

That pact would allow some US presence in Afghanistan even after most of our troops leave at the end of this year. Obama says he wants to finalize the accord, but he mostly sounds enthusiastic about getting out.

More than 60,000 troops have already left Afghanistan, Obama boasted Tuesday in his State of the Union Address. To thundering applause he said that soon “America’s longest war will finally be over.”

Great. Then what? “If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain” for training and assisting Afghans in their pursuit of al Qaeda, Obama said.

If?

Flashback: Soon after taking office the new president faced a similar situation in Iraq. He half-heartedly tried to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, with the Iraqi government to leave a residual US presence after the bulk of the force left. But Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki made unreasonable demands, and Obama, whose overarching goal was to get out, gave up and ordered all the troops to leave by the end of 2011.

Remember, this was not long after a surge of US troops defeated al Qaeda in Iraq, something that had seemed like mission impossible.

But Sunni Iraqis were sick and tired of the foreign terrorists that usurped their main stronghold, Anbar Province. So the US force, led by Gen. David Petraeus, rallied them and managed to chase al Qaeda out.

Zoom back to now: Last month an al Qaeda offshoot, this time called “the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,” took over Anbar’s main cities, Falujah and Ramadi.

Before Obama “ended” the Iraq war, we got good at rallying Iraqi partners to help us and themselves — and for that, not too many US troops are needed. But with none in the country, the gains of the Iraqi surge are now gone.

Ditto Afghanistan. “We won’t survive unless the United States maintains some presence” next year, a top Afghan diplomat told me recently.

To be sure, that’s clearly not what Karzai says. He’s amassing impossible new demands (including, weirdly, a US promise to negotiate with the Taliban, his own enemies) before signing the agreement.

Obama says he wants Karzai to sign on — but that little “if” on Tuesday indicates that he’s markedly less sure about it than he is about “ending” the war.

And there’s more: According to the administration’s favorite paper, The New York Times, Obama recently gathered a panel of experts “to devise alternatives to mitigate the damage if a final security deal cannot be struck with the Afghan president.”

He’s worried because the mainstay of his terror-fighting, drone strikes, is about to be lost. If we leave Afghanistan with no agreement, his security aides tell him, we’ll lose our drone bases in the entire region.

As the Afghan diplomat made abundantly clear to me, a SOFA pact is in the Karzai government’s interest. Yet Obama, who’s made room for so much understanding of how adversaries like Iran have political needs that sometimes makes them say horrible things in public, fails to see the same in Karzai’s posturing.

Seven decades after World War II, we still have troops in Germany. US troops still guard the 38th parallel, though a Korean War ceasefire was reached back in 1953.

Obama, however, seems to think that “ending” wars is more important than securing the gains made in them. And no matter that, of the 1,500 Americans killed in the Afghan war, 975 were slain on Obama’s watch. If we let Afghanistan fall apart now, what was the point?

Let’s face it: Karzai is there because of America and he’d be in real trouble if we don’t maintain some presence in his country. More importantly, a residual force in Afghanistan is vital to America’s security.

So where does this nagging “if” come from?",Q1
http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/news/10870561.Award_for__unflappable__Afghanistan_soldier/,Award for 'unflappable' Afghanistan soldier,"Calum Macgregor was one of nine engineers to be awarded the Brigadier Coin in recognition of his duty.

The 40-year-old was part of a voluntary six-month posting in Afghanistan with the Army Reserves 75 Engineering Regiment.

Their role was to decommission and strip out bases that were closing and to extend other posts for improvement, ready for handing over to the Afghan Army.

Calum’s wife Gail, aged 43, said: “We were really made up because he works so hard and it’s really nice that he was recognised.”

The Brigadier Coin is awarded to those who demonstrate “outstanding unflappable temperament and determination”.

Calum did not tell his family that he had been awarded the coin till he returned home from his tour. Gail, who has been married to Calum for 16 years, said: “I think he was surprised himself that he’d been honoured.”

The married couple have two children, Cameron, aged 10, and Georgia, aged 13, who, along with grand-mother-in-law Mary Jane Cusack, were delighted Calum had received the honour.

Father-in-law Ken-neth Cunliffe, aged 66, said: “The whole of the family is extremely proud of him.”

Calum joined the Army when he was just 16 and was a full-time soldier for 11 years before becoming a reserve.

He now works full-time as a police officer in Manchester city centre.

Calum said: “It was a surprise, and made me proud to be chosen.”

http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-22523-45-killed-in-Afghan-bus-crash,Feel-good stories,"Last month the film Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (if you're a girl) won the Oscar for best documentary (short subject). The film focuses on Afghan girls who learn to skate through a programme run by Berlin-based NGO Skateistan which purports to ""give children the opportunity to become leaders for a better world"" by combining ""skateboarding with creative, arts-based education"".

At the Oscars ceremony, director Carol Dysinger described the film as a ""love letter to the brave girls of that country"" and praised the work of Skateistan, which, in her words, teaches ""girls courage, to raise your hand, to say I am here and I have something to say"".

With this win, Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone joins a long list of Western-produced, critically acclaimed films, books, articles, photos, etc about Afghan women and girls in distress who – often with the helpful hand of a Westerner – find their way to empowerment.

In recent years, we saw Barry Levinson's Rock the Kasbah (2015), in which a young Afghan singer (played by Palestinian actress Leem Lubany) is ""discovered"" by a struggling American music manager (Bill Murry). There was also Angelina Jolie's animated feature Breadwinner (2017) about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to support her struggling family during the Taliban rule in Kabul.

The film is based on the award-winning trilogy of books The Breadwinner (2001-03) by Canadian author Deborah Ellis who got inspired to write them after interviewing Afghan refugees in a camp in Pakistan in the late 1990s.

Articles about ""Afghan girl empowerment"" also regularly make it to Western media outlets. There have been a myriad of stories about ""Afghanistan's first female graffiti artist who is risking it all for her murals""; about Afghan girls learning to play Coldplay and Bob Marley songs on a guitar; about an all-female orchestra telling the Taliban ""we won't be silenced"" and so on.

In all of these stories, Afghan women and girls who pursue their interests are presented as seemingly breaking the gender norms of their society. They are artists, hipsters, rebels with a cause, who are often introduced as trailblazers, the first-of-whatever social experience that is ""unheard of"" in their natural landscape of violence, poverty and misfortune.

So why does the West love to tell stories of Muslim girls doing edgy or artsy things in Afghanistan? Why do these stories matter so much to Western audiences?

These stories decontextualise the lives of these girls, presenting them as ideal victims for pity and ideal heroes for admiration. Their feats make Westerners feel good about the war in Afghanistan, that unlike the Iraq war was the ""good"" war, which ""liberated"" girls and women and gave them opportunities their own society would have never afforded them. After all, the ""liberation of Afghan women"" was one of the declared noble causes of the 2001 US-led invasion named Operation Enduring Freedom.

Apart from evoking white saviour emotions, such stories also serve well to cover up the complexities of economic and political realities in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Muslim world. Indeed, it is much more soothing and gratifying for a Westerner to believe that girls and women suffer because of the ""inherent backwardness"" of their societies rather than because of centuries of ruthless Western military and political intervention in their countries leading to constant conflicts.

These stories set the scene in Afghanistan and elsewhere as a clash of values – modern vs tradition, women vs patriarchy, individual desire vs community norms – and conveniently drive attention away from the horrors of the global ""war on terror"" and the havoc it has wreaked on the lives of Afghan women and men.

The experiences of Afghan (and more generally Muslim) girls and women are thus commodified into what media scholar Gillian Whitlock calls propaganda ""soft weapons"" – narratives from the third world which serve the political and military agenda of Western powers. In this sense, all these stories of empowerment are mediated for the purposes of Western intervention.

One could trace Western obsession with women's and girls' victimhood in Afghanistan to one iconic image – the 1985 National Geographic's Afghan girl cover. For decades, the image of eight-year-old Afghan refugee Sharbat Gula was published, reprinted and displayed many times without her name or true story. It was accompanied by a single deceptive caption ""Haunted eyes tell of an Afghan refugee's fears"".

Her eyes, however, were not full of fear but rather anger at a white man – American photographer Steve McCurry – who had barged into her all-girls class and made her teacher order her out to pose for a photo she did not want to pose for.

Fifteen years later, Sharbat was dragged out of her village and made to take a nine-hour journey so she would again be forced to show her face to that same white man and his white crew from the National Geographic.

Her body would be objectified and commodified again. ""Time and hardship have erased her youth. Her skin looks like leather. The geometry of her jaw has softened. The eyes still glare; that has not softened,"" declared the magazine.

Nidal Malik Hasan was already found guilty of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009 massacre, which was the worst mass murder at a military base in the nation's history.

Hasan had exchanged e-mails with al-Qaeda in which he discussed the idea of being a martyr for attacking fellow soldiers. Hasan is an American-born Muslim, and he said he believed the killings were justified because he felt he was doing his duty to fight an ""illegal war"" in Afghanistan. Hasan said he picked November 5 because it was right around the time his unit was preparing to go to Afghanistan

He released documents to The New York Times, which included a mental health evaluation and other statements.

""I don't think what I did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my Muslim brothers,"" he said according to pages he provided.

Prosecutors in the case were adamant about pushing for the death penalty, which is apparently rare in military cases. Lead prosecutor Col. Mike Mulligan elaborated on whether Hasan will die as a martyr or not.

""You cannot offer what you don't own; you cannot give away what is not yours,"" he said. ""He can never be a martyr because he has nothing to give.....Do not be misled; do not be confused; do not be fooled. He is not giving his life. We are taking his life.""",Q1

2 April 2013

A new military command, established to improve the way MOD prepares for and conducts operations, reaches full operating capability today.

The significant milestone means that the Joint Forces Command (JFC) is now, on 2 April 2013, fully-manned and able to fulfil the entire range of its responsibilities in support of Defence’s objectives for current operations, future contingencies and for the longer term.

The JFC brings together over 20,000 military and civilian personnel to ensure that joint capabilities are correctly prioritised and prepared for operations. In addition to thousands of personnel working in Cyprus, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and the British Indian Ocean Territory, the JFC also includes the Defence Academy in Wiltshire and Defence Intelligence and cyber capabilities.

A number of units have also been transferred to the command in order to ensure better training and coherence for a range of specialities, from doctors and nurses to linguists and military surveyors.

A key aim of the establishment of the JFC is to create a more direct link between front line experience and top-level planning.

An idea whose time has come

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, who was appointed in December 2011 to establish the Joint Forces Command, said:

""I am very pleased that we mark the full operating capability of the Joint Forces Command in record time. This new Command, an essential element in the transformation of UK Defence, is already making its mark around the world. As the first commander, it is quite clear to me that this is an idea whose time has come.""

The creation of the JFC was recommended by the Defence Reform review, led by Lord Levene, as part of the most significant programme of change across the Ministry of Defence in a generation. The report was published in June 2011.

About 10,000 other sailors, soldiers and airmen actually deployed on operations, such as those in Afghanistan, continue to be commanded by the Permanent Joint Headquarters, part of the new organisation. Both are based in Northwood near London. A key task for the JFC is to help ensure that lessons learnt on operations are absorbed into the development of future concepts and capabilities, helping the Navy, Army and RAF to build on their strengths in the future.

JFC is based at Northwood headquarters, near Watford in Hertfordshire.

http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/dec/31/women-rangers-afghanistan-band-e-amir-conservation,Women rangers now roam Afghanistan's first national park,"It took 62 years for women rangers to achieve equal status with their male peers in the US National Park Service: in Afghanistan, it has taken just three. In a landmark event for Afghanistan, four women were recently hired as park rangers in the country's Band-e-Amir National Park – the first female park rangers ever employed in the nation.

Band-e-Amir is Afghanistan's only national park. Established in 2009 with the help of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), it is one of the world's most beautiful landscapes and has been nominated as a World Heritage site. The park's six deep-blue crystal clear lakes are a surprising tourist draw in the country. Over 4,000 visitors a month come to the park in the summer, with the same number in just one weekend in some holiday periods.



The park is particularly popular among women from all over Afghanistan as a recreational area and for the reputed therapeutic properties of the water. It is also home to a number of rare and endangered species, including the recently re-discovered Persian leopard.



In 2012, the park's Protected Area Committee made the groundbreaking decision to hire women rangers. Park managers, representatives from the 14 villages in the park, as well as provincial and district governments unanimously endorsed the concept. The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (Mail) took action to recruit and hire the women rangers in July 2013.



The hiring of Sediqa, Nikbakht, Fatima, and Kubra represents a significant milestone both for the employment of women in Afghanistan and for their involvement in the nation's law enforcement field. According to Nato, less than 1% of Afghanistan National Police are female, while the World Bank estimates that only 16% of Afghan women are employed in the formal economy.



These new women rangers will make a great contribution to the effective management of Band-e-Amir. In helping to safeguard Afghanistan's wildlife and natural wonders, they, along with their male colleagues, will also serve as role models for other like-minded men and women considering a career in wildlife conservation.



In our work to assist the management of Band-e-Amir, WCS works regularly with Haji Akhlaqi, a village elder and head of the council that represents the 14 villages in the park. Akhlaqi and his neighbours appreciate the woman rangers, who assist many woman tourists who visit the park and participate in certain ""sensitive"" activities such as bathing in the spiritual waters.



Habiba Sarabi, governor of Bamyan Province and Afghanistan's first woman governor, recently told us the new park rangers ""represent the growing employment opportunities for all Afghanistan's citizens as well as the preservation of the country's natural heritage"".



Equipment and training for the new women rangers, including in the use of GPS, was funded by the US Agency for International Development (Usaid) and implemented by WCS. With support from USAID since 2006, we have been working with community and government partners to promote the sustainable use of natural resources.



In the US's own national parks, a ""woman rangerette"" named Claire Marie Hodges worked temporarily in Yosemite during the summer of 1918, filling a gap left by men who were serving in World War I. For the next 46 years, women served as National Park naturalists, interpreters, and ""visitor assistants"" but were prohibited from becoming full-fledged rangers.



It was not until 1964 that two women were admitted into ranger training school, with support from the Justice department under Robert Kennedy. Finally, in 1978, 60 years after Hodge's summer job, women rangers achieved the right to receive the same training, hold the same jobs, and wear the same uniform as their male counterparts. Today, almost one-third of National Park Service rangers are women.



In Band-e Amir National Park, Sediqa, Nikbakht, Fatima and Kubra are demonstrating every day what Kennedy believed – that professional preparedness, discipline, and success are traits in no way limited by one's gender.

The sentence was the most severe possible but left surviving victims and relatives of the dead deeply unsatisfied.

Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 40, who pleaded guilty in June, showed no emotion as the verdict was announced. Bales’ mother, sitting in the front row of the court, bowed her head and wept.

A grand assembly of tribal chieftains, community elders and politicians began four days of debating the bilateral security agreement (BSA), which will shape Washington's future military presence in Afghanistan.

Hours before the meeting, US Secretary of State John Kerry said the two sides had finally agreed the text of the pact after months of difficult negotiations.

If the ""loya jirga"" assembly approves the BSA, it must then be passed by the Afghan parliament.

It has been touted as vital to the country's future after 2014, when the bulk of Nato's 75,000 troops will pull out. The Taliban insurgency this year has reached levels of violence not seen since 2010, according to the UN.

Former U.S. Marine Justin Eldridge lived through mortar fire in Afghanistan but, tragically, last night, he lost his long battle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.



At about 9 p.m. on Oct. 28,Waterford Police responded to a 911 call from his wife, Joanna, who feared her husband intended to harm himself. Waterford Police arrived at the family home at 147 Great Neck Road, where they learned Justin had a gun and that the couple's four children were also in the home.



As police surrounded the house, the Connecticut State Police Emergency Services Unit attempted to make contact with Justin, to no avail. When police finally entered the home, they found Justin dead of an apparent self-inflicted wound.



His final message, posted on his Facebook Page at about 9 p.m., ""theres only so much bashing someone can take before they react........."" A post to his Facebook about 12 hours earlier perhaps summed up his long battle with PTSD, ""invincibility isn't a gift, it's a curse.""



In an interview with Patch in June to promote a fundraiser to benefit the Wounded Warrior Foundation, Justin's wife Joanna detailed her husband's struggles. Justin served in the Marine Corps for eight-and-a-half years and served in Afghanistan before he was medically retired in 2008. He had severe PTSD, suffering from depression and erratic mood swings. He also suffered from a traumatic brain injury, which went undiagnosed for a long time.



After fighting for his country, Justin had to fight again to get the benefits and the specialized treatment he needed. His wife, Joanna, became his advocate and stayed home to take care of him and their four children. Justin's medical and psychological issues made it impossible for him to work, so he was a stay-at-home dad too, and Joanna said that the kids loved having him around.



""Seeing him go through all of this, trying to get better for his family — he is my hero,"" Joanna told Patch in June.



Now, sadly, another hero has been lost to a battle against an unseen enemy that proved to be so much harder to fight.

MILWAUKEE (WITI) -- When you sign up for the military, you do so knowing you could be ordered overseas at any time. However, choosing to be deployed is a different story -- and that is just what Dr. Donald Gundlach did.



Dr. Gundlach is the regional clinic director for Dental Associates, overseeing clinics in Franklin, Sturtevant and Kenosha -- and he's also an Army soldier.



""When I first got in the Army, I would always joke around 'you know, we`re just dentists,' but then a friend of mine said 'hey, if you save this guy from having an abscess when he`s in the middle of Afghanistan, you`ve done your role,'"" Dr. Gundlach told FOX6 News.



In November, Dr. Gundlach voluntarily deployed to Afghanistan.



""I thought that this would be a great chance for me to go over there and give them a little bit more of myself to help those guys out. I really didn`t know what to expect over there. I mean, I didn`t know at all,"" Dr. Gundlach said.



Dr. Gundlach found himself in desert conditions, working long days with patients from around the world. However, the job itself was the same as in his civilian practice.



""The number one thing is we`re looking at the condition of the individual teeth. ""We're looking for decay. We're also looking at his bite. We're making sure that the gums are in good shape -- that there's no signs of any kind of systematic disease,"" Dr. Gundlach said.



In Afghanistan, there was one big difference in Dr. Gundlach's day-to-day duties. Occasionally, his patients came from the four-legged world.



""When we were over there we did a number of root canals on dogs. I did several extractions, which is a whole different world on dogs than it is on humans and we didn`t have a lot of guidance. The vets that were there, the veterinarians, they didn`t have a lot of experience doing the dentistry,"" Dr. Grundlach said.



After roughly 100 days overseas, Dr. Grundlach is back serving patients in the Milwaukee area. He says the experience left him with more self-confidence and respect for our deployed military and appreciation for his wife.



""She was really great about it. I mean, it took her a day or so to realize this was going to happen, and she understood my reasoning. I think it was much harder on her and she never said a negative thing to me about it. She just put on a happy face and dealt with it all. She did really well,"" Dr. Grundlach said.",Q1

A wounded warrior participates in a small game hunt at the LEEK Hunting & Mountain Preserve in Potter County. The program, run by Ed Fisher of Lewisberry and his brother Lew, has won the armed services' Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award.

(courtesy of LEEK Hunting & Mountain Preserve)

Of all the people and programs in the United States that demonstrate exceptional patriotism and humanitarian concerns for members of the armed forces and their families, the military selects one.

All the different commands within the military are asked to suggest nominees, each branch selects one to forward for final consideration, and from those a committee from all branches of the military selects a winner of the Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award.

This year, that one is the LEEK Hunting and Mountain Preserve - a wounded warriors program created by Ed Fisher of Lewisberry and his brother Lew.

""We're incredibly humbled, considering the competition that was out there,"" said Ed Fisher.

The non-profit program, based at the family's hunting camp in Potter County, takes disabled veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan on hunting trips as a form of therapy.

The program works with an all-volunteer staff and Potter County landowners have given the hunters access to 24,000 acres of private hunting land.

Fisher - no relation to the philanthropists for whom the award is named - said he credits ""all the volunteers who make it happen - some of them put hundreds of hours in. It's incredible what they do.""

The LEEK program has been in operation for six seasons.

""To win this award speaks volumes about what we're doing and where we're headed,"" said Fisher, who is currently preparing to host a crew of six wounded warriors for bear season from Nov. 22-27 and another crew of six to hunt deer Dec 11-15.

LEEK was nominated for the award by Rear Admiral Joseph P. Mulloy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Budget.

""LEEK truly exemplifies the values held so important by Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher,"" said Mulloy. ""LEEK's dedication and service to all our service men and women is a very focused mission of providing outdoor recreational activities through the generosity and selfless volunteer service of dozens and provides an immediate and direct benefit to our nation's recovering wounded warriors.""",Q1

http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-6-197140-Provincial-govts-want-toothless-LG-system-to-retain-powers:-Sethi,Big perks for Punjab MPAs still far from reality,"ISLAMABAD: The fate of a bill that gave phenomenal raises to the salaries, perks and privileges of the members of the Punjab Assembly (MPAs), provincial ministers, advisers, special assistants and parliamentary secretaries hangs in balance.

The Punjab government seems indecisive and finds itself between a rock and a hard place to do anything about it. It became clear from conversations with two political figures of the provincial administration that the bill has not so far been assented by the governor.

In a one-line comment, Punjab government spokesman Dr Shahbaz Gill told The News that the provincial law department is looking into the bill. He was asked about its fate.

A Punjab minister told this correspondent on condition of anonymity that deliberations were going on to decide the final fate of the bill. “The bill was resent to the governor for assent, and he was required to approve or return it to the Punjab assembly for reconsideration within the constitutionally prescribed ten days.”

The minister said that it has to be kept in mind that since the bill was unanimously passed by the provincial assembly, it has to go back to the legislature again for approving or repealing it. “Only the legislature is competent to do anything about it.”

He said that it was clear to everyone including the governor that Prime Minister Imran Khan disapproved the increase in the salaries and perks and privileges, and wanted their reversal.

It transpired from his comments that the Punjab government is conscious of the reaction of the MPAs, who passed the bill because they wanted significant increase in their salaries and perks and privileges to bring them at least at par with those of their counterparts in other provincial assemblies.

The five movers of the bill belonged to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan People’s Party. They had tabled it in the assembly as a private members’ bill that was owned by the treasury and opposition alike, which was evident from its unanimous passage within minutes without any debate.

Approval of the bill caused paramount embarrassment to the ruling coalition and ignited a strong public umbrage from all and sundry specifically from the prime minister, who made his indignation public through his tweets.

He especially summoned Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to Islamabad to express his consternation. After that, the Punjab government found itself in a tailspin. On the very day, March 13, the bill was passed by the provincial assembly, it was transmitted to Governor Chaudhry Sarwar for assent. However, he was quickly stopped by the prime minister to refuse assent, and he publicly announced that he would not approve it as he has directions from Imran Khan to the effect.

Later, Speaker Chaudhry Pervez Elahi amended the bill by slashing the salaries and some other benefits that have been made available to Usman Buzdar and him. Nothing was officially heard after that. But it was believed that the proposed legislation has been transmitted to the governor.

Under Article 116 of the Constitution, when a bill is presented to the governor for assent, he shall, within ten days, assent to it or in the case of a bill other than a Money Bill, return it to the provincial assembly with a message requesting that it, or any of its specified provision, be reconsidered.

When the governor has thus returned the bill, it will be reconsidered by the assembly and, if it is again passed, with or without amendment by the votes of the majority of MPAs present and voting, it will be again presented to the governor, who shall give his assent within ten days failing which such assent shall be deemed to have been given.

The provision makes it clear that the governor has the power to return a bill only once but when it is passed by the assembly again, accepting or rejecting his suggested amendments, he has no power to do anything with it and the bill will automatically become an act after ten days. Under this article, he can’t withhold his assent beyond ten days. According to the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of Punjab when a bill is assented or is deemed to have been assented to by the governor, the Secretary will immediately cause it to be published in the official Gazette as an act of the assembly.

Rule 113 says when a bill is returned by the governor with a message requesting that it, or any of its specified provision, be reconsidered or that any of its amendment be considered, the secretary will circulate the message to the MPAs and will also send an intimation to that effect to the Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs and to the Minister-in-charge, who may give notice of motions in respect of the bill returned in the specified manner. No such thing has so far happened. The rule further says that a different procedure will be adopted when the governor’s message pertains generally to the whole bill and no specific amendment has been proposed.",Q1

His 1995 memoir, “and the Oscar-winning documentary film “The Fog of War” expressed those regrets.The Wright siblings are reminded that their father lost a fellow soldier at the time of his death, young John Francis Shea, who was childless. His sacrifice is not forgotten. The impact of his death on his mother and family cannot be fully expressed and understood. No parent wants to bury his or her child. The Shea and Wright families’ stories are a part of the 58,000 U.S. men and women who died in Viet Nam, a chapter among the millions, who shed their blood for the commonwealth of the United States of America.Description of Wright’s and Shea’s deaths, Incident 62-01961 is posted in the Gold Book:The loss of their parents, Sp5 Wyley Wright Jr. (born December 7, 1931 in White House, Florida, a District of Jacksonville, Florida; died March 9, 1964, South Viet Nam) and Ouida F. McLendon Wright (born January 10, 1935 in Ozark, Dale County, Alabama- died March 9, 1970 at Martin Army Hospital at Fort Benning, Georgia), while they were both in their early thirties, had a major impact of the Wright siblings. Their parents’ death was not spoken of among them openly until 2008. As a result of lessons learned the Wright siblings would advise the families of fallen soldiers from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to talk often and very early on about their loss. Unresolved pain delays healing.Family members such as their maternal grandmother, Willie Bell Williams McLendon helped them mold into the people they are today, raising them until the oldest Jackquelyn, at age 20, began raising her 15 year old brother and 10 year old sister and the eldest son went into the Army. A great work ethic was instilled by their parents and reinforced by family members. (Jackquelyn earned two degrees from the University of Georgia while raising her teenage sister and elementary age daughter.) Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ has been the foundation for their prevailing as fatherless and motherless children to overcome many destructive challenges in U.S. society.The distinctive Tennessee stone home, 1103 Bedford Avenue, Columbus, Georgia built by their mother from their father’s Metropolitan Life Insurance proceeds was lost to foreclosure in the mid 1980’s. Neighbors and cousins, Katie and Robert Morris (U.S. Army Veteran), much like the biblical principle of kinsman redeemer, bought the home to keep it in the family and turned it into a senior services home in alignment with Ouida F. Wright’s philosophy of being of service to others.Although Ouida F. Wright was buried in Green Acres Cemetery in Columbus, Georgia, a well-kept perpetual property, the Wright siblings decided to join their parents’ remains since they had a great love for each other. It was a photo of Ouida F. McLendon, “Miss Frederick Douglass” of Phenix City, Alabama that caught Sp5 Wright’s eye and heart with love at first sight, as a fellow soldier, Cecil Griffin dropped the picture on the ship floor as they traveled across the Pacific Ocean returning from the Korean War. Wright picked it up and asked for an introduction.

Sarah Adleta, 29, asked the court for leniency, claiming that she was manipulated by her husband

Jonathan Adleta faces life in prison for abusing his daughter

A Florida mother has been sentenced to 54 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to sexually abusing her children together with her husband, a decorated Marine.



Sarah Adleta, 29, was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor. Her retired Marine ex-husband Jonathan Adleta, who was awarded the Purple Heart, was found guilty last month and faces 10 years to life in jail.



The disgraced Marine officer, 25, allegedly wanted to have 'daddy-daughter sex', according to graphic details from the trial in Orlando, Florida.



Doomed: Sarah Adleta, 29, was sentenced to 54 years in federal prison for abusing her two children. Her Marine husband Jonathan Adleta (right), who has been found guilty, will learn his fate in December



Jonathan Adleta allegedly told Sarah when she was pregnant that he would only marry her if she consented to him abusing their daughter while she was expected to do the same to their son, according to the Orlando Sentinel .

Even after the couple divorced, the children's horrifying ordeal continued. The mother went to live in Orlando, Florida with the children but her ex convinced her to let him abuse their daughter over Skype.

She also brought her daughter to visit her ex-husband in Oklahoma so that he could abuse her.



During Adleta's sentencing hearing Monday, mental health counselor Cherilyn Rowland Petrie testified that the couple's young daughter exhibited such disturbing sexual behaviour that she had to be removed from the home of a family that had been caring for her following the arrest of her parents, The Orlando Sentinel reported.

Traumatized: A mental health expert testified that the couple's daughter (left) had the developmental level of an 18-month-old and exhibited such disturbing sexual behaviour that she had to be removed from a foster home

The girl, who was 4 years old at the time, had the developmental level of an 18-month-old, was malnourished and not potty-trained.



Sarah Adleta's father made an emotional plea asking the judge to give his daughter the maximum sentence, telling the court that 'justice is needed.'



The 29-year-old appealed for mercy, telling the judge that she was manipulated by her ex-husband, Jonathan Adleta.



The defense was hoping that the mother of two would get a concurrent sentence of 27 years instead of two consecutive 27-year terms, with public defender James Smith arguing that Miss Adleta helped convict her ex-husband by offering her testimony against him.



However, Judge Roy Dalton Jr said that the facts of this case were so 'egregious' that he decided to sentence her to 27 years in prison for each of the two counts.



The abuse began when the little girl was born in March 2009. The couple married the following year.



Sarah Adleta told the court this week that she consented to the abuse of her children because she loved Adleta and needed the financial support.

Horrifying: Jurors heard despicable details of the sexual abuse of two young children at Orlando federal court this week (pictured)

The Adletas' horrifying and despicable sexual abuse of their own children was only uncovered when FBI were tipped off when the mother sent naked pictures of herself and the toddlers to a man in North Carolina.

Chinese President Xi Jinping who was on an official visit to Uzbekistan on September 8 - 10 and his Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov held talks on further development of bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries.

During the meeting the Chinese president said that China and Uzbekistan are important strategic partners.

Jinping offered a five-point proposal on furthering pragmatic cooperation between the two countries.

He urged the two countries to raise the volume of trade turnover to $5 billion by 2017 and to start talks on a free trade zone as early as possible and expand mutual investment.

Jinping also called China and Uzbekistan to deepen energy cooperation by ensuring the safe and stable operation of the China-Uzbekistan gas pipeline and expanding cooperation in such areas as natural gas processing, oil shale development and renewable energy.

According to the Chinese president, the two countries should promote infrastructure connectivity and complete the rail and road networks linking China, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.

Jinping also said that China and Uzbekistan should build joint special industrial zones and agricultural demonstration parks, as well as develop cooperation in science and technology.

Lastly, Jinping urged the two countries to promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges.

Karimov, in turn, said China has provided sincere help in Uzbekistan's development, and it has been proven by facts that China is a great neighbor and a reliable partner.

Uzbekistan also appreciates China's important contributions to world peace and development, he added.

Karimov also stressed that energy cooperation is considered a priority, pledging to build a safe and reliable natural gas pipeline connecting the two countries.

According to the Uzbek president, his country welcomes the investment of Chinese enterprises and is willing to promote the interconnectivity with China in such fields as trade, communication, transportation infrastructure and culture.

The two leaders also exchanged views on the situation in Central Asia and agreed to deepen their law enforcement and defense cooperation, combat terrorism, extremism and separatism, drug trafficking and transnational crimes, protect major cooperation projects, as well as maintain peace and stability of both countries and the whole region.

They also voiced their joint position on Afghanistan, pledging support for the reconciliation and reconstruction efforts in the country.

After their talks, the both presidents issued a joint declaration which envisaged further boosting of bilateral cooperation and deepening of strategic partnership between China and Uzbekistan.

Furthermore, the two presidents attended the ceremony of signing of a number of cooperation documents in such fields as economy and trade, energy, investment and financing.

In particular, an agreement was signed between the Chinese Export-Import Bank and the Industrial and Construction Bank of Uzbekistan (Uzpromstroybank).

According to the document, the Export-Import Bank of China will allot a loan worth $165.6 million to Uzbekistan for the modernization of the Angren thermal power plant in the Tashkent region.

The funds are allocated for a period of 20 years, including a five-year grace period.

According to the contract, the Chinese company will build a new energy bloc with a capacity of 150 MW for burning high-ash coal. The bloc is planned to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2016.

The project worth $242.6 million is financed through the loans of the Chinese Export-Import Bank and Uzbekenrgo's funds worth $75.1 million.

Furthermore, China and Uzbekistan signed an agreement on the principles of construction and operation of the Uzbekistan - China gas pipeline.

According to the document, the two countries will build the fourth branch of the Uzbekistan-China gas pipeline with a capacity of 30 billion cubic meters of gas per year.

The construction of a Central Asia - China gas pipeline began in 2008.

The pipeline is designed to export natural gas from Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to China.

The total length of the gas pipeline is about 7,000 km.

The project's cost is about $2.2 billion, and its financing is carried out through credit from the China Development Bank as well as with the direct investments of the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC).

In total during the visit, the two countries signed 31 documents on joint implementation of projects with a total value of more than $15 billion, in which the financial resources of China will be around $7.7 billion.

Uzbekistan and China are developing cooperation in oil, gas, petrochemical, chemical and mining industries, in the fields of transport and logistics, the manufacturing industry, telecommunicatio ns, production of electrical technology and modern construction materials, as well as in a number of other sectors of the economy.

The trade turnover between the two countries amounted to $3.23 billion in 2012. The dynamics of sustainable growth has been retained this year.

Some 455 enterprises with Chinese capital are operating in Uzbekistan.

The Chinese companies are involved in projects of exploration and exploitation of deposits of hydrocarbons, uranium and other precious materials, in the project of gas chemical complex in Mubarek and other high-tech industries.",Q1

HALIFAX – Canada’s defence minister and his counterpart in the U.S. expressed concerns Friday about whether Afghanistan will sign a security deal to keep 8,000 U.S. troops in the country over the next decade.

Chuck Hagel, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, said during the Halifax International Security Form that he needs the deal signed and ratified by the Afghan parliament before he recommends to President Barack Obama that U.S. military members continue to risk their lives there.

“Without a clear agreement it will be difficult for us to plan, and our partners to plan, what would be the acceptable role,” Hagel said.

The Americans are trying to work out an agreement with Afghanistan that would lay out how the U.S. military would operate there after next year.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai urged tribal elders on Thursday to approve a security pact with Washington that keeps U.S. troops in Afghanistan until 2024. But he said he will leave it to his successor to sign the deal after the country’s elections on April 5 — a move that has stunned the U.S.

Story continues below advertisement

Karzai’s speech to the 2,500 members of a consultative council known as the Loya Jirga were made as Obama made a plea for quick passage of the agreement in a letter promising to respect Afghanistan’s sovereignty and only raid homes when U.S. lives are at risk.

Senior U.S. military officials have said Afghan forces require three to four years of training if they’re to continue fighting off a Taliban insurgency that shows no sign of surrendering.

The exit of all foreign forces without an agreement would raise questions about the more than $8 billion by western countries that has been pledged annually to fund Afghan security forces and help with the country’s development after 2014.

Canada has committed $100 million annually to support the Afghan military after it ends its training mission there in March.

Federal Defence Minister Rob Nicholson said he is also concerned about the negotiations between U.S. officials and Karzai.

“We’re very interested, very concerned about what’s taking place there,” Nicholson said. “We’re watching very carefully the developments in Afghanistan with respect to the negotiations on a bilateral security agreement.”

During a keynote speech at the conference later in the day, Hagel also said America will protect its sovereignty in the Arctic as climate change increases the amount of navigable water around its coastlines off Alaska.

He said energy exploration in the largely untapped Arctic region could heighten international tensions, but countries must work together to avoid conflict.

“Throughout human history mankind has raced to discover the new frontier and time after time discovery was swiftly followed by new conflict. We cannot erase this history, but we can ensure this history doesn’t repeat itself in the Arctic.”

He also said the U.S. is planning long-term military plans for the Arctic, even as it struggles with budget restraint.

Earlier in the day, Hagel and Nicholson signed a bilateral agreement to share information about their countries’ military activities in the Asia Pacific region, a deal the American defence leader said reflects a shift of his country’s military and economic priorities.

“Like the United States, Canada is a Pacific nation and in light of America’s ongoing rebalance to the Asia Pacific, we both benefit by working together,” Hagel said.

He said there will be an annual meeting between senior military leaders from both nations about operations in the Asia Pacific.

Nicholson said the deal will help avoid overlap when providing disaster relief in cases such as the response to typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.",Q1
http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/1899166/lest-we-forget-from-tanks-to-the-taliban-and-beyond/?cs=7,Lest we forget: from tanks to the Taliban and beyond,"Some, like Avery, had the security of the armoured tank. Small artillery fire could not penetrate this intimidating weapon. But the tank was very difficult to manoeuvre in the rough and hilly terrain. The tanks would support the ground troops, firing at the tops of the coconut trees where the Japanese enemy were hiding. The stench of sweat dripped from men who were enclosed in the cramped cabin of the tank. The temperature could reach 150 degrees. If they managed to survive the heat then they had to contend with the constant threat of malaria and rampant dysentery. The soldiers were constantly facing death. Avery quietly recalls one particular afternoon when he was routinely filling up his tank with petrol. It started in the distance but slowly the explosions grew louder and closer. This was a daily occurrence. The Japanese had air supremacy. As Avery and his mate were walking up a small hill, the radio and siren signalled their imminent death. The only reason Avery is still alive is because his friend grabbed his arm and pulled him over the other side of the hill. The bomb dropped exactly where they had just been standing. The shrapnel whizzed past his ear: ""It would have cut us in half."" Avery owes his life to his friend.",Q1
http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2013/11/14/us-atrocities-in-afghanistan,US Atrocities in Afghanistan,"by Stephen Lendman

US drones murder Afghan civilian men, women and children. American grounds forces do it up close and personal.

US inflicted death, torture and other atrocities reflect daily life. Ordinary Afghans suffer most. They struggle to survive. American aggression is one of history's greatest crimes.

War criminals remain unpunished. Accountability is denied. Conflict persists. It's Washington's longest war. It's longer than WW I and II combined. It shows no signs of ending.

Trillions of dollars go mass slaughter and destruction. They're spent for unchallenged global dominance.

Vital homeland needs go begging. Targeted countries are ravaged and destroyed. Imperial lawlessness operates this way.

Its appetite is insatiable. It ignores rule of law principles. It does whatever it wants. It does it where, when, by what means, and under whatever pretexts it contrives.

It does so unapologetically. It targets one country at a time or in multiples. It wages direct and proxy wars. It does so without justification. It lies claiming otherwise.

Atrocities are virtually de rigueur. All US wars are dirty. In March 2012, 20 US forces murdered 16 Afghan men, women, and nine children aged two to 12.

Children were massacred while they slept. Two women were raped before soldiers killed them. Pentagon officials and media scoundrels whitewashed what happened.

One soldier was blamed for crimes 20 US forces committed. Nineteen got off scot-free. Cold blooded murder and other atrocities persist. They do so with disturbing regularity.

On November 12, Reuters headlined "" 'Lack of US Cooperation halts Afghan probe into civilian killings,"" saying:

""Afghanistan's intelligence service has abandoned its investigation into the murder of a group of civilians after being refused access to US special forces soldiers suspected of involvement, according to a document obtained by Reuters.""

War crimes were committed. US forces raided Wardak province. They did so from October 2012 to February 2013.

Seventeen Afghan men were detained. They disappeared. Residents found 10 buried in shallow graves. They were several hundred meters from where US forces are based.

""In the report authored by Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) intelligence agency, investigators said they had asked the United States for access to three US Green Berets and four Afghan translators working with them but were rebuffed,"" said Reuters.

On September 23, NDS published its report. ""Despite many requests (it made, America hasn't) cooperated,"" it said. ""Without (its) cooperation, this process cannot be completed.""

Pentagon officials routinely whitewash serious war crimes. So do US commanders on the ground. Doing so is longstanding US policy. Rare exceptions prove the rule.

Under a decade long military agreement, Afghan officials can't charge US forces with war crimes. Whatever they do, they're immune.

Zakeria Kandahari is an Afghan translator. He works with US Green Berets. He's done so for nine years.

Documents Reuters obtained explained how US interrogations are conducted. Kandahari witnessed Sayid Mohammed's treatment.

He was murdered. Kandahari named three US Special Forces responsible. He kicked Mohammed,"" he said. He beat him. He threatened him.

""I handed him over to Mr. Dave and Mr. Hagen, but later I saw his body in a black body bag,"" he said.

Wardak residents accuse US forces of abducting Afghan men and boys. Interrogations involving torture follows.

Karzai is a US installed stooge. He's done nothing to stop what's persisted throughout his tenure. Failure to act responsibly reflects complicity.

Russia Today interviewed journalist Matthieu Aikins. He spent five months investigating the Wardak incident.

Local residents bore testimony. They supplied credible evidence. War crimes were committed. According to Aikins:

""The special forces team was deployed to an isolated valley west of Kabul, where the Taliban and other insurgents groups have a very heavy presence.""

""Over last winter, the locals started complaining that the forces team and their translators were murdering people, abducting them, trotting them, and disappearing them.""

""Just extraordinary allegations that at the time were essentially unproven.""

In November 2012, residents first complained about a so-called Special Forces ODA 3124 unit.

When it withdrew in April, human remains were discovered near America's Nerkh district base.

Local authorities determined that ODA 3124 operations bore full responsibility.

Survivor testimonies confirmed it. Victims described being severely beaten and tortured.

ICRC representatives obtained more evidence. Because of an alleged US investigation, details weren't disclosed.

According to Aikins:

""In the five months that I spent reporting this story, not a single one of the witnesses that I spoke to had ever been contacted by the US military investigator.""

""So it does really beg the question whether these investigators are actually going to be able to establish any sort of accountability of what happened.""

It bears repeating. Pentagon officials routinely whitewash serious war crimes. So do US commanders on the ground.

Unaccountability is standard practice. US forces guilty of rape, torture and murder go unpunished.

On November 6, Aitkins headlined his Rolling Stone article ""The A-Team Killings.""

""Last spring,"" he said, ""the remains of 10 missing Afghan villagers were dug up outside a US Special Forces base - was it a war crime or just another episode in a very dirty war?""

Six months after US Special Forces arrived in Wardak province, allegations of torture and murder surfaced.

Locals said 10 civilians were abducted. They disappeared. US Special Forces were responsible.

They killed another eight Afghans during their operations. Perhaps more bodies remain to be discovered.

On February 16, ""a student named Nasratullah was found under a bridge with his throat slit,"" said Aikins.

Family members said US Green Berets abducted him. Other bodies were found. In July, Col. Jane Crichton lied, saying:

""After thorough investigation, there was no credible evidence to substantiate misconduct by ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) or US forces.""

According to Aikins:

""(O)ver the past five months, Rolling Stone has interviewed more than two dozen eyewitnesses and victims' families who've provided consistent and detailed allegations of the involvement of American forces in the disappearance of the 10 men, and has talked to Afghan and Western officials who were familiar with confidential Afghan-government, UN and Red Cross investigations that found the allegations credible.""

""In July, a UN report on civilian casualties in Afghanistan warned: 'The reported disappearances, arbitrary killings and torture - if proven to have been committed under the auspices of a party to the armed conflict - may amount to war crimes.""

Aikins recounted Gul Rahim's killing. He spoke to three of his neighbors. They saw US Special Forces arrive.

They heard gun shots. When they left. They saw Rahim's ""bullet-ridden body lying among the apple trees, his skull shattered.""

A man identified only as Omar was targeted. He witnessed Rahim's killing. He survived.

He was taken to America's Nerkh base. He was put in a plywood cell. Interrogations began the next morning.

His hands were bound above his head. He was suspended and beaten. Afghan translator Zakeria Kandahari was involved.

Two Americans interrogated him. He said he knew nothing about Rahim and local Taliban commanders.

Beatings intensified. Sessions lasted for two days. ""At one point,"" said Aikins, ""Kandahari held a pistol to Omar's head and told him that he would kill him as easily as he had killed his friend.""

He was certain he'd die. At night, he was shackled in his plywood cell. Americans handed him over to Afghan forces. He realized he was being freed.

"" 'I promised that I would kill you,' he says Kandahari told him, 'and I don't know how you're getting away alive.""

Wardak is an intense battleground. It's ""littered with bomb craters and burned-out tanker trucks,"" said Aikins.

Many disappeared Afghans ""were rounded up by the Americans in broad daylight, in front of dozens of witnesses.""

Aikins obtained credible testimonies. Mohammad Hazrat Janan is deputy head of Wardak's provincial council.

US forces terrorize people, he said. They do it ""because they could not defeat the insurgents.""

People abducted weren't Taliban, he explained. ""(B)ut even if they were, no one is allowed to just kill them in this way.""

Nerkh district feels besieged, said Aikins. It's a ""hotbed of guerrilla resistance."" It's close to Kabul. It's a ""staging ground for suicide attacks on the capital.""

US forces are stationed at Combat Outpost Nerkh. Green Beret units are called Operational Detachment Alpha, ODA, or A-Team. The Nerkha-based one is called ODA 3124.

It's involved in counterinsurgency operations. They part of what's known as ""white"" Special Forces. So-called ""black"" ones launch night raids.

CIA elements are involved in local operations. Insurgents control Nerkh rural areas. US forces are vulnerable to ambushes or roadside blasts.

Nerkh incidents didn't occur in a vacuum, said Aikins. ""Over the past 10 years human rights groups, the UN and Congress have repeatedly documented the recurring abuse of detainees in the custody of the US military, the CIA and their Afghan allies.""

According to Human Rights Watch Asia advocacy director John Sifton:

""The US military has a poor track record of holding its forces responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes.""

""There are some cases of detainee deaths 11 years ago that resulted in no punishments.""

Aikins said a former ODA 3124 interpreter named Farooq said he ""routinely witnessed abusive interrogations during his time with the A-Team, involving physical beatings with fists, feet, cables and the use of devices similar to Tasers.""

When Obama begins drawing down US forces, Green Berets and CIA will remain. According to Aikins, they'll be even less oversight than now.

Based on what he's seen and gotten from witnesses, ""the fight in Afghanistan may get even dirtier.""

Covert war may continue interminably. Afghans have enjoyed rare times of peace. They've had none for over three decades. Future prospects look grim.

For centuries, Afghans experienced what few can imagine. Marauding armies besieged cities. They slaughtered thousands. They caused vast destruction.

Imperial Britain and Czarist Russia vied for control. Local warlords exerted their own dominance. When Soviet Russia withdrew in 1989, a ravaged country remained.

Living Afghans can't remember peace, stability and tranquility. Endless conflicts persist.

Post-9/11, America's attack, invasion and occupation followed. Millions died. Countless others suffer horrifically.

It bears repeating. Nothing ahead looks promising. America came to stay. Permanent occupation is planned.

Afghanistan is strategically important. It straddles the Middle East, South and Central Asia. It's in the heart of Eurasia.

Occupation projects America's military might. It targets Russia, China, Iran, and other oil-rich Middle East states.

It furthers Washington's imperium. It prioritizes unchallenged global dominance. It seeks control over Afghan's untapped natural gas, oil and other mineral resources.

In June 2010, The New York Times headlined ""US Identifies Vast Mineral Riches in Afghanistan,"" saying:

They're worth an estimated $1 trillion. Estimates are notoriously inaccurate.

Whatever they're worth, they include ""huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium - are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States officials believe.""

An internal Pentagon memo calls Afghanistan the ""Saudi Arabia of lithium."" It's a key material needed to produce ""batteries, laptops and BlackBerrys.""

Years of development are needed. Huge potential exists. Heavy investment is likely. An economic bonanza awaits profiteers.

Don't expect ordinary Afghans to benefit. Surviving concerns them most. Violence continues unabated.

Living conditions are deplorable. Vital services are lacking. Millions have little or no access to clean water.

Many don't get enough food. Life expectancy is one of the world's lowest. Infant mortality is one of the highest.

Extreme poverty, unemployment, human misery, and constant fear reflect daily life. Washington prioritizes conquest, colonization, plunder and dominance.

War without end rages. Human needs go begging. Wherever America shows up, death and destruction follow. So does unrelieved dystopian harshness. No end in sight looms.

SAN FRANCISCO–(ENEWSPF)–October 31, 2013. Four service women and the Service Women’s Action Network filed an amended complaint today in their lawsuit against the Department of Defense for its ongoing blanket exclusion of women from thousands of ground combat positions. The plaintiffs originally filed a lawsuit challenging the DoD’s ban on women in combat positions last year with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Northern California, and the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP.

The four service members have all done tours in Iraq or Afghanistan – some deploying multiple times – where they served in combat or led female troops who went on missions with combat infantrymen. Their careers and opportunities continue to be limited by the DoD’s ongoing policy and practice of excluding women from many positions, units, combat arms schools, and training programs, despite the DoD’s announcement in January 2013 that it was rescinding its 1994 combat exclusion directive.

One plaintiff, Army Staff Sgt. Jennifer Hunt, served in Afghanistan, where she accompanied combat arms soldiers on missions in remote mountain areas, and in Iraq, where her vehicle was hit by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). Hunt was awarded the Purple Heart for shrapnel injuries sustained in that attack. Yet she is still not allowed to compete to attend Special Forces School, which is not open to women.

“I have served honorably side-by-side with my brothers-in-arms for over a decade and, like many of my fellow female soldiers, performed under the same harsh and dangerous wartime conditions. I just want the same opportunities for myself and fellow soldiers to compete for these positions,” said Hunt. “We were deeply gratified when the repeal was announced earlier this year, but the slow progress is hampering the reenlistment decisions of soldiers like myself and impacting the military’s efforts to recruit women for these positions. Attracting and retaining the best and brightest for every job, no matter their gender, is of the utmost importance to secure military readiness.”

Women make up more than 14 percent of the 1.4 million active military personnel, yet are still excluded from over 200,000 positions despite the repeal of the 1994 combat exclusion policy in January. Some branches, such as the Marine Corps, claim that they still have to study the effects of allowing women to serve in combat before opening up combat arms career fields, despite the fact that women have already been serving on the ground for years.

“These women have already shown in Iraq and Afghanistan that they can serve as honorably and bravely as their male counterparts, including in small combat and special forces teams” said Ariela Migdal, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women’s Rights Project. “There is no justification for maintaining a blanket ban on women in these career fields and combat arms positions.”

Two of the plaintiffs led the Marine Corps Female Engagement Teams (FET) in Afghanistan. The FETs lived with and conducted missions with combat infantrymen. Another plaintiff was sent on similar missions in the Army, accompanying combat troops in Afghanistan. Because these were considered temporary duties outside of the servicewomen’s official specialties, their combat experience is not given official recognition.

“We are losing a generation of leaders while the DoD drags its feet,” said Elizabeth Gill, staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. “A generation of women have now deployed and served in combat zones, and want to move into leadership positions. Yet the longer the DoD delays opening all positions to women, the greater the risk that these female leaders will choose to leave the service.”

Other plaintiffs include:

Marine Capt. Zoe Bedell, who served in Afghanistan as the officer in charge of the FET program. Her teams lived with infantrymen for several weeks and frequently encountered combat situations.

Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar, who is an Air National Guard search and rescue helicopter pilot who flew Medevac missions in Afghanistan. In 2009, her helicopter was shot down while rescuing three injured soldiers, and she and her crew were forced to engage in combat. Hegar, who returned fire after sustaining shrapnel wounds, was awarded the Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor, and was returned to flying status within a week.

Marine Capt. Colleen Farrell, who was deployed to Afghanistan where she led FETs that were regularly in danger of drawing enemy fire, being ambushed, or hit by IEDs. Although the teams she commanded lived and worked alongside infantrymen and special forces units, they were prevented from fully participating in training with those troops.

The amended complaint calls for the federal court to declare that the DoD’s policies and practices of excluding women from combat arms positions and schools violates the Constitution and to require the DoD to allow qualified servicewomen to be considered on their individual merit for all such positions.

“Although combat exclusion was lifted nearly a year ago, we’ve seen very little evidence of plans to further open up combat assignments to women,” said Service Women’s Action Network executive director and former Marine Corps captain Anu Bhagwati. “The service branches are stalling while we lose experienced, talented service women to the civilian workforce because of the military’s brass ceiling. Tens of thousands of military jobs still remain closed to women. It is unacceptable that in the year 2013 the military would pass over a more qualified woman for a less qualified man. Our troops deserve to serve in a meritocracy. Every woman or man who meets the standard for a job should get the job. Period.”

If you received a data breach notification letter, it is essential you understand what is at risk.

If you received a data breach notification, it is essential you understand what is at risk. More about our investigation into this breach, and what you can do if your data was stolen, is available here .

Last year, 1,862 data breaches affected more than 189 million people. On average, victims of identity theft spend 200 hours and over $1,300 recovering their identity. Many victims also suffer emotional distress, credit damage, and may even end up with a criminal record. Taking immediate action is the best way to prevent the worst consequences of a data breach.

What We Know So Far About the Wagstaff Data Breach

Wagstaff, Inc. is an aluminum manufacturing and engineering company based in Spokane Valley, Washington. The company provides machinery, technology, and services that enable aluminum producers to turn molten aluminum into solid shapes. Wagstaff currently maintains two offices in the United States, in Spokane Valley, WA and Hebron, KY, as well as four offices globally. The company employs approximately 350 people and generates roughly $118 million in annual revenue.

According to a recent letter sent by Wagstaff to affected employees, on December 26, 2021, the company noticed that several of its computer systems were offline and certain files had been encrypted. Wagstaff also received a demand for payment. In response to the ransomware attack, the company disconnected its network and launched an investigation into the incident. As a result of the investigation, Wagstaff learned that some of the company’s files were accessible to the party orchestrating the cyberattack.

Upon learning of the extent of the security breach, Wagstaff then reviewed the affected files to determine what information was compromised. On February 4, 2022, the company concluded its review of all files that were accessible to the unauthorized party. While the compromised information varies by employee, it may include affected employees’ names, addresses and Social Security numbers.

Around March 3, 2022, Wagstaff began sending out data breach notification letters to all employees whose information was compromised.

More About the Causes and Risks of Data Breaches

Often, data breaches are the result of a hacker gaining unauthorized access to a company’s computer systems with the intention of obtaining sensitive consumer information. While no one can know the reason why a hacker targeted Wagstaff, it is common for hackers and other criminals to identify those companies believed to have weak data security systems or vulnerabilities in their networks.

Once a cybercriminal gains access to a computer network, they can then access and remove any data stored on the compromised servers. While in most cases a company experiencing a data breach can identify which files were accessible, there may be no way for the company to tell which files the hacker actually accessed or whether they removed any data.

While the fact that your information was compromised in a data breach does not necessarily mean it will be used for criminal purposes, being the victim of a data breach puts your sensitive data in the hands of an unauthorized person. As a result, you are at an increased risk of identity theft and other frauds, and criminal use of your information is a possibility that should not be ignored.

Given this reality, individuals who receive a Wagstaff data breach notification should take the situation seriously and remain vigilant in checking for any signs of unauthorized activity. Businesses like Wagstaff are responsible for protecting the consumer data in their possession. If evidence emerges that Wagstaff failed to adequately protect your sensitive information, you may be eligible for financial compensation through a data breach lawsuit.

What Are Consumers’ Remedies in the Wake of the Wagstaff Data Breach?

When employees decided to work with Wagstaff, they assumed that the company would take their privacy concerns seriously. And it goes without saying that employees would think twice before giving a company access to their information if they knew it wasn’t going to be secure. Thus, data breaches such as this one raise questions about the adequacy of a company’s data security system.

When a business, government entity, non-profit organization, school, or any other organization accepts and stores employee data, it also accepts a legal obligation to ensure this information remains private. The United States data breach laws allow consumers to pursue civil data breach claims against organizations that fail to protect their information.

Of course, given the recency of the Wagstaff data breach, the investigation into the incident is still in its early stages. And, as of right now, there is not yet any evidence suggesting Wagstaff is legally responsible for the breach. However, that could change as additional information about the breach and its causes is revealed.

If you have questions about your ability to bring a data breach class action lawsuit against Wagstaff, reach out to a data breach attorney as soon as possible.

What Should You Do if You Receive a Wagstaff Data Breach Notification?

If Wagstaff sends you a data breach notification letter, you are among those employees whose information was compromised in the recent breach. While this isn’t a time to panic, the situation warrants your attention. Below are a few important steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft and other fraudulent activity:

Identify What Information Was Compromised: The first thing to do after learning of a data breach is to carefully review the data breach letter sent. The letter will tell you what information of yours was accessible to the unauthorized party. Be sure to make a copy of the letter and keep it for your records. If you have trouble understanding the letter or what steps you can take to protect yourself, a data breach lawyer can help. Limit Future Access to Your Accounts: Once you determine what information of yours was affected by the breach, the safest play is to assume that the hacker orchestrating the attack stole your data. While this may not be the case, it’s better to be safe than sorry. To prevent future access to your accounts, you should change all passwords and security questions for any online account. This includes online banking accounts, credit card accounts, online shopping accounts, and any other account containing your personal information. You should also consider changing your social media account passwords and setting up multi-factor authentication where it is available. Protect Your Credit and Your Financial Accounts: After a data breach, companies often provide affected parties with free credit monitoring services. Signing up for the free credit monitoring offers some significant protections and doesn’t impact any of your rights to pursue a data breach lawsuit against the company if it turns out they were legally responsible for the breach. You should contact a credit bureau to request a copy of your credit report—even if you do not notice any signs of fraud or unauthorized activity. Adding a fraud alert to your account will provide you with additional protection. Consider Implementing a Credit Freeze: A credit freeze prevents anyone from accessing your credit report. Credit freezes are free and stay in effect until you remove them. Once a credit freeze is in place, you can temporarily lift the freeze if you need to apply for any type of credit. While placing a credit freeze on your accounts may seem like overkill, given the risks involved, it’s justified. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center (“ITRC”), placing a credit freeze on your account is the “single most effective way to prevent a new credit/financial account from being opened.” However, just 3% of data breach victims place a freeze on their accounts. Regularly Monitor Your Credit Report and Financial Accounts: Protecting yourself in the wake of a data breach requires an ongoing effort on your part. You should regularly check your credit report and all financial account statements, looking for any signs of unauthorized activity or fraud. You should also call your banks and credit card companies to report the fact that your information was compromised in a data breach.

Below is a copy of the initial data breach letter issued by Wagstaff:

Dear [Consumer],

Wagstaff, Inc. (“Wagstaff”) sends this letter to notify you of a recent incident that may have resulted in unauthorized access to your personal information maintained by Wagstaff, which it maintained in connection with your employment or related work with the company. This letter also provides you with information on the steps Wagstaff has taken to further guard against the potential misappropriation of your data and steps you can take to remain vigilant in monitoring your data.

What Happened?

Wagstaff was recently a victim of a ransomware attack by a threat-actor group known in the cybersecurity industry to carry out such attacks. On December 26, 2021, Wagstaff discovered that numerous network systems were offline, that certain files were encrypted, and found a demand for payment of a ransom left on its system. Wagstaff immediately disconnected its network to prevent further damage to its systems and began restoring systems from backups. Subsequently, Wagstaff engaged legal counsel and a third-party forensics firm to investigate the incident.

What Information was Involved?

Wagstaff launched an immediate, thorough, and swift investigation. With the help of the forensics investigator, Wagstaff identified file locations that may have been accessible to the threat actor while they were in Wagstaff’s systems. Identified locations included human resource files, which contained current and former employee information, including first name, last name, postal address, and Social Security Number.

Based on evidence available during Wagstaff’s investigation, this information was likely available to the threat actor and may have been exfiltrated from Wagstaff’s systems. To be clear, Wagstaff is unable to confirm whether or not the threat actor did indeed exfiltrate files. The forensics investigation, and our review of the potentially affected files, concluded on February 4, 2022.

https://www.wglt.org/local-news/2022-02-18/mchistory-multitalented-suffrage-leader-promoted-womens-health-and-the-vote,McHistory: Multitalented suffrage leader promoted women’s health and the vote,"Ellen Ferguson was a champion of women and women's suffrage.

She made Bloomington-Normal her home in the 1870s. She was born in Cambridge, Cambridge, England. Her father was a successful attorney. And while in England, a young Ellen taught or led classes in French, Latin, German, drawing, elocution, drama, and music.

“This is an extremely well-rounded young woman,"" said McLean County Museum of History Librarian Bill Kemp.

In 1860, she and her husband William Ferguson emigrated to the United States, first to Ohio and then by the early 1870s, to Bloomington. Ellen Ferguson first made a name for herself as a lecturer to all-female audiences on women's health and reproductive health.

“These are very delicate subjects. This is during the Victorian era. You don't want to upset folks sensibilities. Yet, women are starved for forthright and accurate information when it comes to gynecological issues and other reproductive health issues. Her very serious lectures are welcomed in the community. They don't prove controversial. In fact, they prove extremely popular with middle class and upper middle-class women,” said Kemp.

Ferguson was also a vocal supporter for women's suffrage.

She spoke principally concerning the frivolity of fashionable life to which so many girls are brought up.

""They are educated too much in the direction of finery and feathers and not enough in the direction of useful information and the knowledge of how to take care of themselves,” said an observer of one of Ferguson’s speeches.

She also spoke at the annual meeting of the Illinois Women's Suffrage Association held Feb. 13-14, 1872, in downtown Bloomington, 150 years ago.

“She quoted copiously from Professor Huxley’s Science of Government and showed that in former times women had a great deal to do with government affairs. She inveighed against the practice of taxation without representation. This principle of tyranny should be expunged … She thought no woman should pay any more tax until she was granted the vote,” according to minutes of the association meeting.

Among the other speakers at that gathering was Susan B. Anthony, now nationally remembered as a woman’s rights advocate enshrined on a dollar coin by the U.S. government.

Ferguson lead a group of local upper-crust women in Bloomington on a grand tour of Europe, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the like, in 1875.

Ferguson's husband had become increasingly enamored with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or the Mormon church. They relocated to the St George in the Utah territory, not then a state.

Ferguson completed an education on the east coast studying gynecology, obstetrics, minor surgery, and then returned to the Utah territory and helped organize what is today, the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, said Kemp.

“Interestingly, the territorial legislature of Utah is the first to grant women the right for suffrage and that's as early as 1870. So, the state proves attractive to Ellen and her husband not only because of their Mormon faith, but also because this is a state that welcomes women at least when it comes to vote,” said Kemp.

1886, Ferguson helped lead a Mormon women's protests march to Washington, D.C., and the White House where they met with President Grover Cleveland.

“What’s happening there is that Congress was using the cudgel of polygamy attacking Mormons and their polygamous beliefs, and they're undermining other territorial rulings in the past. So, they're threatening to undo women's suffrage and indeed, that's what Congress will do in 1887 as they're kind of battling Mormons in their faith, right?” said Kemp.

A year later, Ferguson severed her ties to the LDS and relocated to New York City with her daughters Ethel and Claire. She died on March 15 1920.

“Sadly, her passing will be five months before the signing into law of the 19th amendment. What she fought for her whole life she never saw to complete fruition,” said Kemp.

“Mrs. Ferguson is an impressive and convincing speaker, practical and thoughtful in everything that relates to the cause and withal a woman of education and culture,” said an observer in the 1870s.",Q1
https://www.columbiatribune.com/story/news/local/2022/01/16/decarlon-seewood-ready-start-work-columbia-missouri-mo-city-manager/9169415002/,"New Columbia city manager De'Carlon Seewood focused on engagement with 'informed, active' residents","De'Carlon Seewood is ready to get started as Columbia's city manager.

While he is the city's first Black city manager, he doesn't see himself as a history-maker, he said before officially taking on the role after John Glascock's retirement Friday.

""Hopefully it means that the city understands and values the need for diversity. They understand the value of having different thoughts and ideas in order for us to be successful,"" Seewood said about his hiring.

He came to Columbia as deputy city manager in 2019 after serving four years as the city manager of Ferguson. Seewood was not city manager when Michael Brown was shot and killed by officer Darren Wilson but did face its lasting impacts as the incident and ensuing racial unrest garnered broad attention.

The active and engaged citizens in Ferguson prepared him for working with similarly active and engaged residents in Columbia, Seewood said.

He also had served as assistant city manager in Ferguson from 2000 to 2007.

The work of government and social engagement isn't just a one-and-done project, but rather is an ongoing process, Seewood said.

""Ferguson for the longest time was working on racial diversity,"" he said, noting the development of a resource center, diversity functions and local organizations.

""Around 2012-2013, they stopped because they felt like we have done all this work, we are done,"" Seewood said.

Brown was killed Aug. 9, 2014.

The work wasn't done, and a section of the citizenry was alienated and the connections were no longer there, Seewood said.

""We have to stay connected and reengage and make sure we are all working on the same page,"" he said. ""I like to believe I am a great collaborator. That is how we will become successful. I believe and get excited in the work.""

Seewood applied for Columbia city manager to be able to continue work on resident and employee engagement.

""I wanted to be in front of getting us there. That is what made me want to take on this role,"" he said.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges, the city has moved forward under Glascock's leadership, Seewood said.

""I am proud to have been part of his administration and I am proud to follow him,"" Seewood said.

A small-town project secures Seewood's career path

Seewood found a love of working with local government while conducting a community development block grant program for Fulton.

That project helped secure improvements to the community park as well as the demolition and rebuilding of dilapidated housing into something affordable.

One of the rehabilitated homes was sold for $12,000 to a single mother of four children.

""It was an amazing project and made me fall in love with local government,"" he said.

This project was after he graduated with his master's degree in public administration from the University of Missouri. He had received his bachelor's in political science in 1994 from Rockhurst University in Kansas City.

Seewod's interest in working for local governments grew while working an internship with the City of Osage Beach during his master's program.

""I had never heard of a city manager until my internship, but knew that was the position I wanted to be in,"" Seewood said.

Learning how things operate

The past two years as the deputy city manager have given Seewood an opportunity to observe how the city operates, he said.

""I was able to learn a lot about what we do and why we do it,"" he said. ""Now I get to actually lead where we are going.""

While there is a lot of work to be done, Seewood first will need the staff to accomplish it. Through the lens of the city's strategic plan, Seewood is tasked with finding ways to combat against what has become known as ""The Great Resignation"" in the U.S.

There are staffing shortages in every single city department.

""We are going to have to figure out a way to galvanize our efforts to bring new employees to the city,"" Seewood said. ""What does that look like and how does that function and what should we be paying people.

""It's not that we are down a couple positions. We are down a lot of positions.""

From USA Today - subscribers only: Economy, job growth set to slow but remain strong in 2022 as Great Resignation rolls on

Seewood is essentially having to rebuild some city functions from the ground up. The strategic plan lays part of that groundwork.

One aspect of the plan includes organizational excellence, and a facet of that is how the city can provide better benefits to its employees. A compensation and wage study is underway that looks at all elements of employee pay.

Another aspect is looking at city code 19-84, which deals with promotions, transfers and other reassignments. Concerns over this specific city code were brought up in June, which then led to accusations being lodged at Glascock by ousted city budget officer Kyle Rieman.

Code 19-84 puts limits on promotion pay increases. Ryan Jarrett, a senior system administrator for the city's IT infrastructure division, expressed concerns about it during the June 21 council meeting. In an email to the city council, Jarrett explained that his compensation was less than another system administrator, even though he had the senior position and responsibilities.

The study is underway, and those conducting the work are receiving employee input on all aspects of the city compensation, including Code 19-84, Seewood said.

""We want (the study) to be driven by our employees. We want our employees to feel that whatever is developed, they helped develop it,"" he said, noting you sometimes try to fix an issue and end up creating more, in reference to Code 19-84.

Community engagement

Seven years ago, the city had a Mayor's Task Force on Community Violence.

While murders in the city are down compared to past years, there is an increase in reported shootings.

It's time to look at the conclusions in that report and continue to follow through on its recommendations, Seewood said.

""And continue to report out what we are doing,"" he said.

Seewood wants to make sure residents feel like they have a voice in their local government and do not feel like they are disenfranchised.

""We do a great job of informing people what is going on, but we struggle with engaging with (people) to let them know they were part of that decision-making,"" he said.

Seewood has a vision for something known as community connectors. These are residents who have knowledge of city plans and then can explain them to neighbors.

""Here is an opportunity for us to engage a group and have them be our eyes and ears inside neighborhoods,"" he said.

Seewood wants to make sure people with solutions are tied to groups, such as city boards and commissions, so those ideas are shared.

More affordable housing still a goal

Affordable and workforce housing remains a goal for the city and for Seewood.

""Those homes that are between $125,000 and $250,000. How do we get those built, and what do we do to incentivize that?"" he said.

Addressing affordable housing also means aiding the city's unsheltered population.

""The unique thing about this community is there are so many different types of services, but how do we tie everything together so we can say here's where you can go?"" Seewood said. ""That is what we need to work on.""",Q1
https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-plot-thickens-pakistans-long-march-to-democracy/cid/1856451,The plot thickens: Pakistan’s long march to democracy - Telegraph India,"Bilawal Bhutto’s ‘Long March’ began in Karachi and terminated in Islamabad on March 7 with a call for a motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The rest of the Opposition has rallied around, including the principal leader in exile, Nawaz Sharif. The pieces are, therefore, now in place for another political confrontation, perhaps even a crisis, in Pakistan.

Crises in Pakistan are not unusual. There was a major terrorist attack by the Islamic State on a Shia mosque in Peshawar recently, underlining that the organization’s capacity to strike on either side of the Durand Line is intact. The dire state of the economy has been a standard talking point for months. The uncertainties posed by the conflict in Ukraine and the wider implications of sanctions on Russia provide the general context.

Perhaps a deeper worry, as yet largely unstated, relates to Afghanistan. The triumphalism of last year following the Taliban comeback in Kabul is now tempered by growing Western disinterest in Afghanistan and, consequently, tighter purse strings. Ukraine will be sucking out all the oxygen around in the foreseeable future. Deeply embedded in Pakistani political memory is a similar situation in the 1990s when the end of the Cold War meant US and Western indifference in Afghanistan just a few years after a decisive victory against the Soviet Union. Perhaps the apprehension now is that as a new Cold War sets in across the Atlantic and Europe, an older history will repeat itself again.



Yet, notwithstanding all this, Pakistan today is wholly absorbed in the political drama playing out over the future of the prime minister, Imran Khan. Although the motion of no confidence was tabled on the culmination of the Long March, the situation has been brewing for some time. There have been enough missteps by the government to galvanize the Opposition into coming together on the single-point agenda of bringing to an end Imran Khan’s incumbency as prime minister.

Much more is involved than the underperformance of Imran Khan’s government or his own mistakes. The key operative factor is the view that the military and, in particular, the Pakistan army would take of a serious attempt to dislodge Imran Khan. He is, after all, their chosen candidate and was the preferred instrument to wrest office from Nawaz Sharif and push his party into the Opposition. But over the course of 2021, as the Taliban clawed their way back to power in Kabul, a largely but not entirely silent civil-military drama had unfolded in Islamabad. Its outcome was not announced; indeed, it is not even categorical. But a considerable consensus among tea-leaf readers gravitated to the view that the protective cloak of the army that had so far enveloped Imran Khan was being pulled away. To his opponents, this was tantamount to the emperor having no clothes.

The army’s neutrality means a level playing field but it also amounts to a significant shift in Imran Khan’s political horoscope. His allies now appear just that less reliable and the disgruntled in his own party more demanding and recalcitrant.

In this background, Bilawal Bhutto’s Long March to Islamabad is an indication that the Pakistan Peoples Party is now convinced that a final push will bring down Imran Khan’s edifice. The rest of the Opposition concurs. A Long March is an oft-used device in a longer context of protest and conflict in Pakistan’s political culture. Its roots go back all the way to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1970. It was used by Benazir Bhutto in the early 1990s as part of her protests against the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and then again, with greater effect, in 2007 against the then president and military dictator, Pervez Musharraf. Nawaz Sharif was to employ the Long March against President Asif Ali Zardari in 2009. The term essentially means a long rally through a large swath of Pakistan to conclude in the capital — in brief, a show of street power and grassroots strength. As an instrument of protest to bring normal life to a standstill, there has, however, been a shift in gears in the concept of the Long March in 2014. This was when Imran Khan and the Canadian Barelvi preacher, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, joined hands against Nawaz Sharif with the army’s complicit support. The marchers then congregated in the heart of Islamabad, blocking roads with empty containers, and refused to move for some months. That was how Imran Khan emerged as ‘Container Khan’.



The vote on the no confidence motion is not confirmed but is likely to take place on March 28. As Imran Khan has raised the art of political protest in Pakistan to a new high (or, say his detractors, an all-time low), it is unlikely to be just a staid vote. A giant rally has been called by the ruling party on the day before the vote — a show of strength but also an implied threat to those party colleagues or allies who may be tempted to stray when it comes to the voting. The Opposition has also announced another Long March to culminate on the very same day at the same location. Clearly the stakes have been raised by both sides. In the meantime, invective and polemic ricochet of each other with no holds barred. Imran Khan has, in addition, assailed the United States of America, the West, and India and said that the Opposition is powerless against this troika.

The next few days will see a huge outpouring of political passion in Pakistan. Much speculation will also therefore devolve on the military’s role and whether its protective cloak will somehow descend again on the prime minister. On a broader canvas, two issues stand out. First, a motion of no confidence against a sitting prime minister has never been successful. Usually, they have been removed by other tactics. If Imran Khan survives, that part of Pakistan’s history will repeat itself. Second, no prime minister has ever completed a full term. If Imran Khan falls, that history too will be repeating itself.

https://journalrecord.com/2022/03/29/idaho-bill-banning-business-vaccine-requirements-vetoed/,Idaho bill banning business vaccine requirements vetoed,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

BOISE, Idaho (AP) – Idaho Gov. Brad Little has vetoed legislation that would make it illegal for most businesses to require the coronavirus vaccine.

“I am vetoing this legislation because I am a lifelong advocate of limited government,” Little wrote in his transmittal letter on Monday, saying the bill “significantly expands government overreach into the private sector.”

Several states have passed laws either requiring vaccines for certain employees or barring government agencies from issuing vaccine mandates. But broader bans against business vaccine requirements are rarer.

Last year, Montana became the first state in the nation to ban most businesses from requiring vaccines as a condition of employment. That law, like the one proposed in Idaho, cited “discrimination” as the reason.

Montana’s law was challenged in federal court, however. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that coronavirus vaccine requirements could remain in effect for health care workers whose employers accept Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, at least as long as a related interim federal rule remains in place.

Idaho’s bill, dubbed the “Coronavirus Pause Act,” would have subjected public and private employers to a misdemeanor charge punishable by a $1,000 fine if they require vaccines as a condition of employment or service. It includes exemptions for situations involving federal law, existing employee-employer contracts, and businesses that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.

“I have been consistent in stating my belief that businesses should be left to make decisions about the management of their operations and employees with limited interference from the government,” Little wrote. “For the same reason, I sued to stop President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates three times, successfully challenging his unprecedented government overreach into the lives of American workers and the decisions of free businesses.”

Late last week the Idaho House and Senate both adjourned until Thursday, giving them time to wait out any vetoes from Little. At the time, Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder cited the Coronavirus Pause Act as one of the bills the lawmakers were watching.

“It’s difficult to override a veto,” Winder said late Friday night. “But we think that’s the only way we can do it, if we hang around for five days.”

The Coronavirus Pause Act passed both chambers with large margins, but not a veto-proof margin in the House. Proponents said it would prevent businesses from discriminating against those who don’t want to or cannot be vaccinated. But opponents said the measure allows discrimination against people who are vaccinated and doesn’t protect vulnerable people. The bill would have even applied to families that hire in-home workers, but it would have expired in April of 2023 – one year after the termination of all state emergency declarations related to coronavirus.",Q1
https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/house-republicans-announce-medical-marijuana-policy-package,House Republicans announce medical marijuana policy package,"OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. — Oklahoma Republicans announced a plan Monday for a comprehensive medical marijuana policy.

They say it would stop illegal marijuana operations and create a safer market for legal operations. House Republicans believe their 12-point plan will allow for stronger enforcement in the medical marijuana industry.

“If we can get rid of the bad actors, the illegal business in Oklahoma, everyone else will flourish,” T.J. Marti, (R) Broken Arrow, said.

A seven-member Republican working group announced the plan following the largest single-day illegal marijuana bust in state history.

Last month law officers raided a dozen locations statewide and seized 100,000 marijuana plants.

They say nine of the objectives in their plan are directed at weeding out the bad actors.

Second on that list is a program to help fund law enforcement efforts.

“We are creating a grant program for sheriff’s departments that will allow enforcement efforts from their level in every county,” Marti said.

Although, a Tulsa attorney who represents the cannabis industry believes this will lead to tax increases.

“Either they’re going to change where some of the taxes are going or they’re going to raise taxes and both ways have impacts on Oklahomans,"" Amber Peckio Garrett said. ""Either from how we want the money to be spent that’s being raised or we want to fund operations to make sure the illegal grows are not here.”

House Republicans also want to address inspection.

“We are going to require a minimum of one inspection a year and lift the cap that was a maximum of two to allow OMMA to inspect as often as they deem necessary,” Marti said.

Garrett says she believes this is a good idea.

“In case they have a business that is not coming into compliance as fast as they need to or they needed more time to come into compliance. This is a way to make sure that they are to be inspected throughout every step of that way instead of just limiting it to two per year,” Garrett said.

House Republicans say their plan also focuses on patient safety.

“We have a packing standard and maximum beyond-use dates. Currently, you won’t find expiration dates on products. We all feel that should be changed,” Marti said.

The entire 12-point plan:

Making the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority a standalone agency (no bill number listed)

A grant program for county sheriff's departments to fund law enforcement efforts in every county (HB 3530)

Full implementation of a seed to sale system (either via court order or new legislation)

Provisional licensing requiring pre-license inspections and increased document submission prior to approval (HB 3734)

Tiered grow license fees based on growing size (HB 2179)

Separate licensing for medical marijuana wholesalers (HB 3634)

All medical marijuana businesses to post standardized permit signage at the place of business (HB 2025)

Stringent electrical and water data reporting by marijuana growers (HB 4055)

Annual inspections (HB 2024)

Product packaging standards and maximum beyond use dates (HB 3019; HB 4288)

Standardized laboratory testing and equipment (HB 4056)

Marijuana grows to register as environmentally sensitive crop owners with the Agriculture Department (HB 3827)

The FBI will never question Prince Andrew about his associations with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

The Duke of York had been under immense pressure to talk with investigators about the friendships before settling rape charges against him with an estimated $16 million payment to complainant Virginia Giuffre.

Prince Andrew Settles Lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre

Despite accusing him of ""zero cooperation,"" investigators dropped the case, and the file is said to be ""gathering dust."" While his civil case may have shed new light on his friendships with the two, the Duke is now believed to be convinced that his settlement will have no bearing on the stalled FBI investigation.

The financial details of the settlement would never be divulged, according to royal advisers, and Prince Andrew would retain his titles of Duke of York, Queen's Counselor or State, and Vice-Admiral.

However, there are rising calls for the disgraced Duke's final remaining functions to be removed from him, as well as the pomp and perks that continue to surround him, as per The Sun. There are also calls for the settlement's finances to be made public, with major doubts being raised about whether taxpayer money was used directly or indirectly to have the rape accusations withdrawn.

Virginia Giuffre may be forced to reveal details of her settlement with Prince Andrew after a lawyer who is suing her requested that she hand over documents to a court.

Alan Dershowitz, who worked for Jeffrey Epstein as an attorney, has been accused of sexually assaulting Virginia Roberts Giuffre, and the two are currently involved in a defamation dispute.

Dershowitz, 83, who has also represented Harvey Weinstein and former President Donald Trump, claims that Giuffre defamed him with sexual assault charges that were rejected last year by a New York judge.

Giuffre, who was 17 at the time of the allegations, was not a victim of Epstein's, but rather a recruiter of young women for the financier to exploit, he claims. The news of Prince Andrew's settlement had been made public the day before. The total sum is $16 million, with $13.9 million going to Giuffre, 38, and $2.72 million going to her sex abuse charity, according to the Telegraph.

Prince Andrew Will Disappear From Public Life

Dershowitz may be calculating the amount of compensation he should seek if he wins his own lawsuit, which is due to be tried in the Eastern District of New York next year, according to legal experts.

The Duke of York and Giuffre are thought to have signed a non-disclosure agreement, which means neither party may speak publicly about the lawsuit or the claims.

However, it is uncertain if they would be disclosed following the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, as has been reported. Giuffre's attorneys stated yesterday that there is nothing in the settlement that prevents her from addressing the claims against Prince Andrew as evidence in Dershowitz's case.

Despite being compelled to stand away from royal duties, Prince Andrew believes he still has a lot to give the public, according to an expert. Following a humiliating appearance on BBC Newsnight in which he discussed his relationship with sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, the Duke of York withdrew from public life in 2019. Prince Andrew expressed his regrets for his involvement with Epstein in a statement filed in court records, and committed to help sex trafficking victims.

Russell Myers, royal editor of the Daily Mirror, claimed this might have been Andrew's method of preparing himself for a return to public life. However, Russell stated it was ""impossible"" for him to play a public role in the future. It comes as York council members consider revoking Prince Andrew's honorary freedom of the city.",Q1
https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/5000-150-years-of-art-beaux-arts-bauhaus-and-beyond,"150 years of art: Beaux Arts, Bauhaus, and beyond","150 Years of Art Read an essay by art journalist Robin Cembalest ’82 about the School of Art’s importance. See work by ten School of Art alumni, from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first.

In 1887, an undergrad declared in the Yale Record that Yale’s art school existed to provide “light occupation to a large number of young ladies residing in New Haven and the vicinity.” The Record is a humor magazine, but the characterization was not entirely a joke. Although Yale’s was the first professional art school in a US university, and although its curriculum was modeled on that of the École des Beaux Arts in Paris, nothing could override the certainty of the time that women had no real place at Yale. Inevitably, the first Yale school to admit women wasn’t taken seriously.

This academic year, Yale is celebrating both the 150th anniversary of the opening of its art school and the 150th anniversary of those first women students. The Yale School of Art is now a powerhouse in fine arts education. It’s consistently number one in US News and World Report’s ranking of MFA programs. Its alums are conspicuously well represented in major galleries, museums, and showcases like the Whitney Biennial. In fact, a University of Chicago economist demonstrated in a 2005 paper that investing in the work of the school’s best students is a good strategy for beating the art market. He told the New York Times that he had looked at other art schools, but none came close.

The 150-year road to such international status has been driven not only by changing attitudes toward women, but also by Yale’s own changing attitudes about art and by a major revolution in the art world.

To the donors who established the school—known then as the School of Fine Arts—women weren’t an afterthought. Augustus Street ’12 and his wife, Caroline Leffingwell Street, had had seven daughters. Their donations came with the requirement that the school be “open to both sexes, for such as propose to follow art as a profession.” In 1864, the Streets’ donations launched the construction of Street Hall and provided a partial endowment for the future art school. After Augustus Street died in 1866, Caroline Street continued to take an active role in the school until her death in 1877. Among other things, she helped to choose the school’s first dean, John Ferguson Weir.

Weir was a 28-year-old painter of budding renown when he was hired as dean in 1869. Classes began on October 15 of that year, with three students enrolled: sisters Alice and Susan Silliman (daughters of chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman Jr. ’37) and Julian B. Smith. Weir’s Beaux Arts curriculum progressed from basic drawing to drawing from casts and live models to painting and sculpture; there were also lecture courses in art theory and history. This traditional program continued with relatively little change for 80 years.

The administration’s commitment in the early decades was lukewarm at best. The school was expected to be self-supporting; it was highly dependent on tuition revenue, and Weir had to mount special exhibits and charge admission just to get the money to equip the classrooms. Although undergraduates in the Sheffield Scientific School could learn drawing skills at the art school, students at Yale College—then considered Yale’s most prestigious school—were not even allowed to take art classes until around the turn of the century. The majority of students for many years were women.

With a few exceptions, the artists Yale trained in those first decades did not make lasting reputations. Perhaps the best known is Frederic Remington ’00BFA, who was one of 7 men in his class of 30 when he entered the school in 1878; he dropped out after a year and a half. (Like many early students, he received his BFA years after leaving Yale, based on his work as a professional artist.) The school first started offering a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1891, and it was a woman—Josephine Miles Lewis ’91BFA—who earned the first. She was the second woman to receive a Yale degree of any kind, following Alice Rufie Jordan Blake, who got her law degree in 1886.

In 1916, the art school added a program in architecture, and in 1924 one in drama. Each would eventually be spun off into distinct Yale schools. The broad commitment to arts education they represent—along with the School of Music, founded separately in 1894—still distinguishes Yale from other elite schools. It’s a difference that redounds to the benefit of the college as well, through undergraduate course offerings and other opportunities, as the admissions office never fails to emphasize.

Weir retired in 1913. The school continued its traditional approach to art education, and soon it began receiving worldwide recognition. From the 1920s until World War II, Yale students won the prestigious Prix de Rome so often that wits began to call it the “Prix de Yale.” A 1940 Life magazine article reported that “tradition and technique are the watchwords at Yale” but also that “in the last five years, Yale students have opened their eyes to the present . . . commenting articulately on such themes as war and poverty and disaster and tyranny.”

But this awakening was nothing compared with the changes that would take place at the school after World War II, when so much of American culture underwent a revolution. At Yale, that revolution arrived in the person of Josef Albers, the German artist who came to America in 1933 after the closing of the Bauhaus, legendary incubator of modern art and design. Art school dean Charles Sawyer invited Albers to come help him reorganize the curriculum. They subsumed the painting and sculpture programs within a department of design—chaired by Albers—which also included a new program in graphic design led by Alvin Eisenman.

Albers explained his philosophy to Yale president A. Whitney Griswold ’29 in a 1951 report: “Art, I believe, cannot be taught directly. Our teaching is, therefore, . . . a training in observation and articulation. . . . The development of technical skills must be subordinated to the development of a flexible imagination.” The old Beaux Arts methods were abandoned as Yale caught up with an art world that had embraced abstract and nonrepresentational art. Albers himself taught a foundational course in color that explored the same ground as his Homage to the Square paintings.

For most of its existence, the school had been open to artists who did not have a college degree; by the 1950s, two years of college or art school were required for admission. In 1959, the school became strictly a graduate school, offering a Master of Fine Arts degree.

Albers’s Bauhaus-inspired pedagogy dominated the school in the 1950s, but in the next decade Yale became more closely associated with the freer, more personal expressionism coming out of New York.

It was in those years that the school began to graduate artists who remain household names, including Chuck Close ’64MFA, Richard Serra ’64MFA, Martin Puryear ’71MFA, Jennifer Bartlett ’65MFA, and Eva Hesse ’59BFA, among others.

The 1960s also brought the school into a new home: Paul Rudolph’s complex and controversial Art and Architecture building. The new building accommodated all the art and architecture students, but in spaces the artists never found adequate. Sculptors were in a low-ceilinged sub-basement, and painters found their quarters too small for the expansive canvases then in vogue. Art and Architecture became separate schools in 1972, but they shared their eponymous building until the School of Art got its own housing: Holcombe T. Green Jr. Hall, on Chapel Street, where painters, graphic designers, and photographers work; sculpture studios are in a nearby building off Edgewood Avenue.

Today, the school’s reputation as a leader is still formidable. Nine alumni of the school, and one former undergraduate art major, were represented at this year’s Whitney Biennial. Sculptor Martin Puryear was selected to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale.

Many alumni say that what makes their education at Yale’s School of Art so valuable is the cohort of fellow artists with whom they study. In his 1991 dean’s report, Andrew Forge, director of studies in painting, wrote: “The MFA program only lasts two years. It is a very short episode in a painter’s education, which is a long-drawn, slow, and often unpredictable business. One of the things that compensates for one’s regrets at seeing students come and go so quickly is the way that generations of graduates stay in contact with each other after they have left, sharing an ethos, an aspiration, and in some special sense, a language.”",Q1

Two justices signed the requisite Wednesday document; one dissented. The order was a response to a motion by Smollett’s attorneys to stay the actor’s sentence while the appellate justices considered a broader appeal on the merits and technicalities of the case.

The court agreed Smollett should remain free for the time being because he was “convicted on non-violent offenses” and because the appellate justices would “be unable to dispose” of the matter “before the defendant would have served his entire sentence of incarceration.”

“The defendant, Jussie Smollett, shall be released from the custody of the Cook County Sheriff upon the posting of a personal recognizance bond . . . in the amount of $150,000,” the document reads.

Though Smollett is now therefore eligible for release, he remains incarcerated as of the time of this report, according to Cook County, Ill. online jail records — assuming those are up to date.

Justices Joy Cunningham and Thomas E. Hoffman signed the order in agreement. Justice Maureen E. Connors disagreed via a signature in the dissent column of the one-page order; she said simply that she “would deny the defendant’s motion.”

All three justices were elected to their posts; they were not appointed. The website Ballotpedia and online news reports say all three are Democrats.

In a March 11 motion, Smollett attorney Nenye E. Uche urged the court to act immediately — or to issue “an otherwise expeditious decision” — due to the “extraordinary circumstances which involve the health and safety of Mr. Smollett being held in custody.” Uche’s motion cited “irreparable damage” from Smollett’s incarceration as one of the issues that deserved the appellate court’s immediate attention.

“Mr. Smollett has a meritorious appeal, and has exercised due diligence in the quest to have this matter heard on the merits of the case,” his attorney further asserted.

Smollett’s counsel has long argued that the office of State’s Attorney Kim Foxx agreed to a pretrial diversion for Smollett and that the terms of that deal — community service and the relinquishment of a $10,000 bail bond — were immediately fulfilled. Because of that, Smollett’s attorneys say his subsequent prosecution by a special prosecutor violated both his contract with the state (by way of Foxx’s office) and his constitutional rights against double jeopardy. The actor’s attorneys also say the special prosecutor was improperly appointed due to pressure from a now-retired judge.

The trial judge who sentenced Smollett to 150 days behind bars back on March 10 did not accept the validity of any of the arguments of Smollett’s attorneys. He also refused to stay the sentence that day.

Uche argued to the appeals court that the appeals process would take longer than the 150 days of incarceration — a point the appellate justices latched onto — but also as follows:

Smollett has become a target of vicious threats in the social media forums which no doubt reflects the hatred and wish for physical harm towards Smollett which he may experience during incarceration. Mr. Smollett anticipates he will most likely be assigned to segregated incarceration or protective custody, both euphemisms for solitary confinement; a situation which could have extraordinary damage on his mental health. As a result, any custodial setting poses a safety and health danger to the life of Mr. Smollett.

The appellate justices did not immediately address those concerns by ordering Smollett released.

The special prosecutor’s office filed separate paperwork to oppose the defendant’s motion:

There is no emergency that warrants the extraordinary relief of staying Mr. Smollett’s sentence pending appeal. Indeed, the Emergency Motion fails to offer a single justification for staying Mr. Smollett’s sentence that is particularized to the facts or circumstances of this case. Rather than attempt to meet his burden of showing good cause for his immediate release, Mr. Smollett makes only cursory, woefully undeveloped arguments. Each fails to demonstrate good cause to stay his jail sentence. The Emergency Motion should be denied.

“Mr. Smollett asserts that he is entitled a stay because he will most likely serve his short, 150-day jail sentence before his appeal on the merits is decided,” the special prosecutor continued. “But, according to this logic, every defendant sentenced to a term of imprisonment less than a few years would automatically receive a stay pending appeal. That simply is not, and cannot be, the rule.”

The appellate judges were apparently unconvinced of that logic.

Smollett was convicted by a jury after the special prosecutor relaunched the case against him. Jurors agreed that he lied to the police repeatedly about a racist and homophobic attack he paid two brothers with whom he worked on a television series to perpetrate against himself.

Some of these demonstrations were attended by Jews in religious garb waving Palestinian flags and displaying anti-Israel banners, including one reading: “Authentic rabbis always opposed Zionism and the state of Israel.”

These people are members of an ultra-Orthodox group of Jews known as the Neturei Karta.

A video of their participation in the initiative was posted to a YouTube channel with 2.1 million subscribers. This is just one of the latest examples of Neturei Karta being co-opted by anti-Zionists to “justify” their anti-Israel and antisemitic agendas.

Neturei Karta, which means “Guardians of the City” in Aramaic, rejects the existence of the State of Israel. The group’s followers believe that Jewish sovereignty in the Holy Land can only be established following the arrival of the Messiah.

During the early 19th century, various Jewish religious denominations held such beliefs. They perceived Zionism as standing in opposition to the Talmud, which teaches “that we are forbidden to rebel against the nations and that we should remain loyal citizens and we shall not attempt to leave the exile which G-d sent us into, ahead of time.”

Today, the Neturei Karta reside mostly in the Israeli neighborhoods of Batei Ungarin and Meah Shearim. They also have a presence in London and New York, where they continue to publicly express their opposition to Israel.

For example, on January 2, Jews held a rally in Brooklyn after two 21-year-olds wearing IDF shirts were harassed and called “dirty Jews.” A counter-rally was held across the street, organized by Neturei Karta along with the pro-Palestinian group Al-Awda. Neturei Karta posted a YouTube video of the event. In the accompanying description, Neturei Karta claimed that the pro-Israel protest effectively “defend[ed] a boy who engaged in provocation in a Palestinian neighborhood in New York.”

On July 31, 2021, an “Honor the Martyrs of Palestine Memorial and Rally” was held in Brooklyn. Despite the fact that the event was scheduled on the Sabbath, when driving is prohibited in traditional Judaism, Neturei Karta members journeyed an hour and a half in order to attend. They then posted another YouTube video and accused Israel of “murder[ing] in one week a number of Palestinian civilians including children.”

Neturei Karta currently consists of a reported 5,000 members — a mere 0.03 percent of the worldwide Jewish population. Yet, the fringe group somehow manages to make it into the news on a regular basis.

Despite their increasingly small numbers, some of the world’s leading anti-Zionists attempt to depict Neturei Karta as maintaining views that are representative of the Jewish people as a whole, or a large segment thereof. This false impression enables others to argue that if, “even Jews are against the existence of a Jewish state, why shouldn’t I be too?”

Indeed, Neturei Karta’s actions do not end with anti-Israel protests. Members of the group have met with Iranian officials, as well as leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Neturei Karta has also associated with internationally-recognized terrorist groups, having gone so far as to bring a gift for Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah to Beirut, and traveling to the Gaza Strip in 2009 to meet with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.

On October 26, 2005, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held a conference in Tehran titled, “The World Without Zionism.”

It was an antisemitic event that generated a worldwide backlash, including condemnations from the United States, the UK, France, and Russia. Yet, Ahmadinejad was lavished with praise by Rabbi Yisroel David Weiss, one of Neturei Karta’s most influential figures at the time. Weiss stated that “Orthodox Jews over the world are saddened by the hysteria which has greeted the recently stated desire of the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to see a world free of Zionism.”

Weiss asserted that the desire to end Zionism is “a yearning for a better, more peaceful world.”

Neturei Karta also associates with Holocaust deniers. For example, members took part in the 2006 Holocaust Denial Convention in Tehran. During this convention, Rabbi Weiss stated that “They [Jews] have used the Holocaust as a device to justify their oppression.”

Rabbi Dovid Feldman, a spokesman for Neturei Karta, said on January 27, 2014, at an Auschwitz memorial press conference, that “[t]he Zionists’ use of the Holocaust for their political purposes is an insult to the memories of the victims.”

Rabbi Moshe Dov Ber Beck, a leader of Neturei Karta who passed away in 2021, is another Holocaust denier. This, even though Beck spent his early years hiding along with his brother from the Nazis during World War II. He then immigrated to Israel in 1948, but decided to move to New York in 1970 due to his opposition to Zionism.

Despite having experienced the horrors of the Holocaust, Beck stated: “The Zionist policy during the Holocaust was that only Jewish bloodshed on a massive scale could help them achieve their state after the war. They provoked antisemitism and sabotaged rescue efforts, all for their political goals.”

Furthermore, Neturei Karta has close ties with the PLO. Rabbi Moshe Hirsch, a former leader of the group, became a companion of the late PLO chairman and notorious terrorist Yasser Arafat. Arafat chose Rabbi Hirsch to be his adviser on Jewish affairs. When Hirsch passed away in 2010, senior Fatah leaders visited the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim to offer their condolences.

During this time, Hatem Abdel Qader, an adviser on Jerusalem affairs to current Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, told the Associated Press: “We consider Rabbi Hirsch a part of the Palestinian people. He is one of the Palestinian Jews whom we give all respect, and this is to confirm that our problem is not with the Jews as a religion, it’s with Zionism.”

Given all this, why is it that Neturei Karta so frequently generates worldwide media coverage (See here, here, here, and here)?

Focusing on such a fringe group calls into question the judgment of leading news organizations, which are tasked with providing balance within the context of the complicated, nuanced Israeli-Palestinian conflict. News outlets’ disproportionate reporting on Neturei Karta risks effectively mainstreaming the group’s radical agenda, and serves to whitewash the antisemitism espoused by governments and terrorist groups across the globe that are committed to the Jewish state’s destruction.

Behind many of the 'romance scams' and financial frauds plaguing internet users is a ruthless gang operating out of Benin, Nigeria, which is now beginning to spread worldwide

'Most politicians, almost everybody is involved,' says one former member (Image: BBC )

A ruthless criminal gang with over 30,000 members is spreading out of Nigeria into Europe – where it’s overwhelming previously well-established groups such as Italy’s Mafia.

The Black Axe is one of several outlaw “cults"" based in Nigeria. The gang even has an informal “murder league” with other crime syndicates, keeping score of how many people they have killed.

‌



A BBC Africa report quotes one online post from the group, which claims: ""Score is presently 15-2, the war is Benin”. Another grim “scoreline” reads ""Hit in Anambra state. Score is Aye [Black Axe] 4 and Buccaneers 2”.

“Axemen” routinely post photos of dead bodies showing clear signs of torture to Nigerian social media as a form of intimidation, as well as to brag about their exploits.

The gang has its roots in Benin City, but has spread across the world (Image: AFP via Getty Images )

The group recruits its members – most of whom are young well-educated men – through a brutal hazing process known as “bamming”.

One Black Axe member writes how he was led away from his university campus by gang members and taken to a wooded area where he was stripped naked and whipped with bamboo canes until he bled.

As the gang members flogged him and threatened to gang-rape his girlfriend he started to think that he might not survive the ordeal.

‌



But the beating suddenly stopped. The young man was then made to drink some of his own blood and chew a kola nut, the locally-grown caffeine-rich seed that is a staple crop in Nigeria, after which he was reborn as a Black Axe member or “Axeman”

He told the BBC that he is haunted by the memory of his victims begging for their lives.

""It's so painful,"" he says. ""The families of the dead, they will curse you. A curse will be upon your life.""

Leaving the group can be dangerous. One former member tell how they received a warning that read: ""A manhunt will befall you. The AXE will pierce through your skull… I will lick your blood and chew your eyes.""

‌



But for all its violent ways, the Black Axe gang’s main income is not from murder or its people-trafficking operation, but from spam email and internet fraud.

‌



Black Axe operates a huge, sophisticated network of romance scams – where victims on dating sites are duped into sending money to a stranger – and other forms of deception. One victim said he had been defrauded of over $3 million.

Scott Augenbaum, a former FBI special agent and cyber-security expert, says Black Axe’s scams can be devastating: ""I've seen lives destroyed, companies go out of business, life savings lost,"" he said. ""It affects everyone.""

“Axemen” often use the words ""mugu"" or ""maye,"" Nigerian slang terms for “idiots,” to refer to their victims.

‌



Hacker 'Uche Tobias' said he had uncovered evidence of a 'fantastically large criminal organisation' (Image: BBC )

It’s a huge operation. Hacker “Uche Tobias” told BBC Africa by hacking into secret records he had found evidence that the group operated ""throughout Europe and America, South America and Asia.

‌



It is not a little club,” he added. “This is a fantastically large criminal organisation.""

The group’s tentacles extend deep into Nigeria’s political and law enforcement communities protecting its members and helping them into positions of power where they can help protect Black Axe and advance its causes.

Tony Kabaka, another former member who has survived countless assassination attempts, said: ”If you sat me down and say, 'Can you identify Black Axe in government?’” he says. ""Most politicians, almost everybody is involved.""",Q1

WASHINGTON—The U.S. securities regulator is considering extending cyber risk management rules to third-party service providers, and beefing up public company disclosures when they experience a breach, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Monday.

Gary Gensler, in an address to securities industry professionals, mapped out a sweeping overhaul of SEC cyber rules, including changes to how stock exchanges and clearinghouses mitigate, and report on cyber risk under the Regulation “Systems Compliance and Integrity” (SCI) aimed at reducing systems issues and improving resilience.

Gensler added that new cybersecurity rules could extend to registered firms’ third-party service providers, including fund administrators, index providers, custodians, and others not currently registered with SEC.

These new rules could include a variety of measures, such as requiring certain registrants to identify service providers that could pose such risks; holding registrants accountable for service providers’ cybersecurity measures and protecting against inappropriate access and investor information.

“This could help ensure important investor protections are not lost and key services are not disrupted as financial sector registrants increasingly rely on outsourced services” Gensler said.

The agency could also make changes to rules around how companies disclose cybersecurity practices and cyber risk, including an update to how they must notify investors when cyber events occur.

Analysts said Gensler’s outline comes at a time of growing concern about how cyber security issues could affect markets and investors. President Joe Biden’s administration has also ratcheted up its focus on the issue after a recent series of high-profile cyber attacks on U.S.-based companies.",Q1

Being our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done, and where the boys have finally made it through the wall.

Can we now all agree that voting for your local school board is important? Because local school boards have begun to lose their minds. For example, down in Tennessee, the McMinn County school board has become nationally famous this week for banning Art Spiegelman’s classic graphic novel, Maus. The minutes of the school board meeting leaked and, boy howdy, they are something else entirely. From the New York Times:

During the McMinn County board’s discussion of “Maus,” multiple board members discussed redacting profanity or said they did not object to teaching the history of the Holocaust. One of the board members, Mike Cochran, said he objected to the language and depiction of nudity. “We don’t need this stuff to teach kids history,” he said, according to the minutes. “We can teach them history and we can teach them graphic history. We can tell them exactly what happened, but we don’t need all the nakedness and all the other stuff.”

It is truly impressive, in a dark and stormy way, how the Right’s media octopus can gin up a national controversy over absolutely nothing. This whole thing began with an attack on the teaching of critical race theory in elementary and secondary schools, where it is not taught at all and never has been. Since then, the book-banners have run amok:

In Virginia, the Spotsylvania County School Board voted unanimously last year to have books with “sexually explicit” material removed from school library shelves. In York County, Pa., teachers and students protested against and overturned a ban on a selection of books told from the perspective of gay, Black and Latino children. And Republican lawmakers in Texas have pushed to reframe history lessons and play down references to slavery and anti-Mexican discrimination.

In Indiana, the yahoos in the state House of Representatives are taking a second try at pushing through a bill that would micromanage classroom discussion to a preposterous extent. The first one crashed and burned when its primary author opined that all political discussion in class should be scrupulously neutral, even a discussion of Nazism, on which history has rendered a fairly decisive verdict.

In Louisiana, the state House of Representatives passed a bill mandating that the Holocaust and World War II be taught in the public schools—take that, Indiana—but balked at an amendment that would have mandated instruction in important moments in Black history. This is a deadly combination for public education: parents plus legislators, both groups now subject to the whims of a media industrial complex that can’t even get it right on a worldwide pandemic.

Let us return to Tennessee for this week’s very special episode of Adventures in Gerrymandering, in which the Tennessee legislature has managed to leave the city of Nashville without a member of Congress to call its own, occasioning Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper’s retirement. From the Tennessean:

Cooper announced his decision Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after legislative Republicans voted in the House to approve the plan to divide Davidson County into three congressional districts. The Republican supermajority's plan sailed through committees and a Senate vote earlier this month…

Through the redistricting process, Cooper pleaded with planners to keep Davidson County whole, calling a plan to split the booming area ""pure folly…The simplest rule is if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,"" Cooper said earlier this month. ""We’re clearly one of the most successful cities in the whole nation. Why mess with that formula of success?” Days later, Republicans in the Tennessee General Assembly revealed an aggressive plan to crack the county, parceling pieces of Cooper's 5th Congressional District into majority white, historically Republican 6th and 7th districts.

Remember that Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority in Rucho, said that what was clearly happening was not happening and that, even if it were happening, the courts had no place in devising a solution to it. Such a shame, but that’s the way it goes.

And we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Our Man in the Bahamas, Friedman of the Plains, sends us the tale of how government works, but not for long. From OKPolicy.org:

The latest report on Oklahoma’s budget transparency showed that during the 2021 Legislative Session, Oklahoma lawmakers unveiled the Fiscal Year 2022 budget (for the year starting July 1, 2021) in mid-May during the last weeks of session. This provided Oklahomans — and even many legislators — only three days between the public unveiling of the $7.7 billion budget and Gov. Stitt’s approval three days later. OK Policy found that the average state deliberated about their budget for 82 days. The three days Oklahoma used for budget deliberations was the nation’s third shortest such timeframe last year, behind only Utah and Nevada at two days and one day, respectively.

In Massachusetts, we generally need the jaws of life to pry our legislators out of the State House every spring, so this form of quik-stop bill-passing is unfamiliar to me. Are there chips and snacks near the cashier? Lotto tickets?

https://www.businessinsider.com/desantis-faces-heartbeat-abortion-ban-as-2024-contest-looms-2023-3,DeSantis' approach to a possible 6-week abortion ban in Florida could torpedo his shot at the presidency,"GOP lawmakers in Florida have introduced a six-week abortion ban.

Republican presidential candidates are typically anti-abortion.

DeSantis faces an uncertain future in how he handles the issue.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida faces a delicate balancing act on the issue of abortion as he heads into the state's lawmaking period, one that's widely expected to be a launching pad for a White House run.

Anti-abortion advocates are pushing the governor to further restrict abortion under the glare of the national spotlight. The earliest chance to do so kicked off Tuesday, when GOP state lawmakers introduced a bill that would make abortion illegal in Florida past six weeks in a pregnancy.

Republican candidates have supported anti-abortion measures in past presidential elections. But the 2024 White House contest will be the first presidential election since the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Since then, nearly half of US states have restricted or fully banned abortion. All the while, the risk of voters' seeing candidates as going too far remains uncertain, and a rigid ban could be a political liability during a general election.

Public opinion is mixed on abortion, with Gallup showing that most people in the US support abortion being legal and that more people want the laws to be less strict rather than more.

Many Republican midterm candidates were hesitant to address abortion during the 2022 cycle, and congressional Democrats believe Roe's demise followed by subsequent abortion bans staved off a ""red wave.""

Democrats put Republicans on the spot about the issue, holding votes on abortion access and saying the court's decision would snowball to demolish other rights, including to birth control access and same-sex and interracial marriage.

While DeSantis has described himself as ""pro-life"" and said he'd ""welcome"" such legislation, he has not led from the front with abortion restrictions in the same way he did for numerous other policy priorities, from curbing illegal immigration to reducing taxes.

Should DeSantis run for president, he would face former President Donald Trump, someone anti-abortion groups often refer to as ""the most pro-life president in history"" because he delivered for their cause, including by appointing three Supreme Court justices that helped overturn Roe. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is also expected to run, has a robust anti-abortion record that he implemented nationally alongside Trump.

But the ramifications of a six-week ban in Florida would go beyond politics. Florida is the only state in the southeast that allows abortions for up to 15 weeks, and the only states in that region that go further are North Carolina and South Carolina. An earlier cut off would limit abortion access for millions of travelers who come to Florida for an abortion from neighboring states and countries.

Anti-abortion groups want federal restrictions

DeSantis signed a bill into law last year — under fanfare with anti-abortion groups — that put the current, 15-week ban into law. It's currently being litigated because Florida's constitution contains a right to privacy.

As the session kicked off in Tallahassee on Tuesday, the path to a six-week abortion ban in Florida appeared more clear than it did a few months ago.

Republicans hold a two-thirds majority in the legislature, and Florida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo told reporters Tuesday that she supported the six-week ban because it had exceptions for rape and incest that are not part of current law.

The comments were different from last year, when Passidomo said she would support limiting abortion for up to 12 weeks.

Asked about the six-week ban on Tuesday, DeSantis told reporters he hadn't seen the bill that was filed, but suggested that legislation would be written in such a way that a further ban wouldn't go into effect unless the court were to green-light Florida's 15-week ban.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told Insider that she was lobbying in Passidomo's district ahead of the 60-day sessions to pressure the leader to go further than her initial backing for a 12-week ban. Supporters from the organization demanded a bill that ""protects life at conception"" during a press conference in Tallahassee on Tuesday.

""When you look at the record for life in Florida, it could be a whole lot better,"" Hawkins told Insider in an interview. ""DeSantis and Florida really need to show leadership on this issue.""

A 12-week ban was not going to give DeSantis ""the credentials we'd look for,"" Hawkins said of DeSantis pursuing the GOP nomination among other contenders.

But Caitlin Connors, Southern regional director for the influential Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, didn't express the same frustration with DeSantis as Students for Life, saying that she thought the governor had been clear that he'd sign a six-week ban into law.

""The legislature is going to have to figure out what the consensus is. We encourage them to do something like a Heartbeat Bill to see those protections put in place,"" Connors said, referring to a six-week ban.

Crossing anti-abortion groups ahead of an election is potentially fraught. Advocates pour millions of dollars into campaigns, knock on doors in districts, and do phone banking at a rate that rivals advocates of numerous other causes.

Marilyn Musgrave, SBA Pro-Life America's vice president of government affairs, told Insider that the group would only support presidential candidates who back a national abortion restriction, which would create a gestational-limits ceiling on abortion in every state. The limit could be 20, 15, or six weeks, she said, and the organization's leaders would talk to all candidates running.

The group is still deciding whether it'll endorse in a primary, and which criteria it'll use to do so, she added.

She and other anti-abortion advocates disagree with the premise that Republicans should try to avoid the topic of abortion, and said during the midterms Republicans should have put Democrats on the spot over loose restrictions.

""When you look at the specific races, it was the failure of some candidates to articulate their pro-life beliefs and pro-life stance,"" Hawkins said. ""They refused to talk about abortion, and they let their opponents do the talking on abortion. That hurt them.""

Democrats vow to go to 'war' against six-week ban

Democratic lawmakers in Florida who support abortion rights are outnumbered in working to stop anti-abortion legislation.

""I now have fewer rights than my mother did,"" Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell of Polk County said during a response to the governor's address. In a press conference with reporters, she acknowledged the math was difficult but vowed the party would fight, arguing that a six-week ban was broadly unpopular among Floridians.

Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book, a Democrat of Plantation, Florida, accused Republicans of going ""scorched earth"" with their abortion ban bill.

""This is it. They have come,"" she said in a statement. ""And if it's a war they want, it's a war they will get. This issue bridges the partisan divide, and we will not go down as easily as they believe.""

The bill also drew condemnation from the White House. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre accused DeSantis of ""attacking the freedom to make one's own healthcare decisions"" — echoing similar comments Vice President Kamala Harris made during a speech on abortion in Tallahassee last month.

In a speech that clocked in under 30 minutes, DeSantis appeared to signal that he would couple anti-abortion measures with policies supporting parents, including tax cuts on needed baby items. One sentence in his speech was about abortion, in which he said Florida was ""proud to be pro-family and we are proud to be pro-life.""

He also urged the legislature not to ""worry about the chattering class"" during the session.

""We won't back down and I can promise you this,"" he said, ""You ain't seen nothing yet.""

https://www.westkentuckystar.com/News/State/Arizona-Democrats-censure-Sinema-for-blocking-voti,Arizona Democrats censure Sinema for blocking voting bill,"By The Associated Press Jan. 22, 2022 | 06:00 PM | PHOENIX

U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is growing increasingly isolated from some of her party’s most influential officials and donors after playing a key role in scuttling voting rights legislation that many Democrats consider essential to preserving democracy.

Leaders of the Arizona Democratic Party voted Saturday to censure Sinema, a symbolic condemnation for the woman who just three years ago brought the party an Arizona Senate seat for the first time in a generation.

Donors are threatening to walk away. Several groups are already collecting money for an eventual primary challenge, even though she’s not on the ballot until 2024. Young activists are holding a second hunger strike to draw attention to Sinema's vote.

The moves offer a preview of the persistent opposition Sinema will likely face within her own party in the two years before she next appears on a ballot. The independent streak that has given her tremendous leverage over the agenda in Washington has enraged many Democrats back home who are intent on preventing her reelection.

“Any reservoir of goodwill that she had is gone,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who may challenge Sinema from the left.

Sinema’s defenders say nobody who’s watched her for the past decade should be surprised by her position. She often bucked her party in the House, ran an aggressively moderate campaign for Senate and has never wavered in her support for upholding the filibuster.

“During three terms in the U.S. House, and now in the Senate, Kyrsten has always promised Arizonans she would be an independent voice for the state — not for either political party,” Hannah Hurley, Sinema’s spokesperson, said in a statement. “She’s delivered for Arizonans and has always been honest about where she stands.”

Her influence is driven by the Senate’s 50-50 split, which essentially gives any senator the ability to kill legislation, an option Sinema has repeatedly exercised.

But she faces political dynamics unlike the other Senate moderate thwarting Democratic ambitions, Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Representing a state that former President Donald Trump carried by nearly 39 percentage points in 2020, Manchin is unlikely to face a progressive challenger who would gain traction.

In Arizona, however, Democrats are ascendant. Joe Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1996, and the party is eager to build on that success. That makes it harder for a Democrat to simply ignore the left here, particularly in a primary election.

Sinema supports the Democrats’ voting rights legislation but steadfastly opposes passing it by changing or eliminating the Senate’s filibuster rule, which effectively requires 60 of 100 votes to pass most legislation. On Wednesday night, she joined Manchin and all Republicans to oppose a one-time rule change so the bill could pass with a simple majority.

Laphonza Butler, president of Emily's List, an important fundraising group for Democratic women who support abortion rights, said in a statement that Sinema's vote “means she will find herself standing alone in the next election."" She said the group would not endorse her reelection if she doesn't support a path forward for voting rights legislation.

Primary Sinema Project, which is raising money for an eventual primary challenge, said it's collected more than $300,000 from nearly 12,000 donors.

“We are quite literally doing everything we physically, possibly can in terms of putting our bodies on the line and trying to plead for this action because the consequences (of inaction) are far worse than starving or going to jail or both,” said Shana Gallagher, one of about three dozen young people holding a hunger strike to protest Sinema and Manchin. Gallagher is co-founder of Un-PAC, launched last year to organize young people in favor of passing voting rights legislation.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent whose fundraising and mobilization abilities are virtually unmatched on the left, suggested he’d support primary challengers to Sinema and Manchin.

Sinema says the filibuster forces bipartisanship on Capitol Hill and ensures that the millions of Americans represented by the minority party have a voice. Repealing it would lead to wild swings in legislation depending on the party in power, she says.

“When one party need only negotiate with itself, policy will inextricably be pushed from the middle towards the extremes,” she said in a floor speech last week, her most expansive explanation of her views on the issue.

Antagonizing the left shores up her standing among the independent women who decide close races in Arizona, said Brian Murray, a GOP consultant in Phoenix and former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party. Sinema has shown the “maverick” sensibilities that made the late GOP Sen. John McCain a favorite son in Arizona, and with her appeal to independents, “she’s going to be nearly impossible to beat,” he said.

“Bernie Sanders is attacking an Arizona senator?” Murray said. “I’d say: ‘Hey, thank you. You’re helping me get reelected.’”

Even Republican Gov. Doug Ducey gave Sinema “credit for standing up and protecting a Senate rule that she believes in.”

“I’m glad that she’s trying to bring people together,” Ducey told reporters. Sinema was one of Ducey’s fiercest critics in 2020, when she relentlessly lambasted his light-touch response to the pandemic.

Sinema’s fight with the left has overshadowed the 2022 reelection bid of Mark Kelly, Arizona’s other Democratic senator, who will be trying to hold on to the seat he won in a special election.

With Sinema taking most of the attention, Kelly managed to avoid taking a position on the filibuster throughout his 2020 campaign and his first year in office. Hours before he had to vote Wednesday, Kelly came out in favor of a one-time workaround to pass the voting rights bill.

Arizona Democratic Party leaders took the highly unusual step Saturday of formally censuring Sinema. A larger group of leaders voted in September to put Sinema “on notice” that her votes on the filibuster and other Democratic priorities, including Biden's big increase in social services spending, will be closely scrutinized.

The move has no practical consequences but demonstrates the frustration of key Democratic activists. Whether the party pulls its support for Sinema’s 2024 bid would be up to the leaders elected after the 2022 midterms.

The Arizona Democratic Party is a diverse coalition that tolerates disagreements, but protecting voter rights is too important, said Raquel Terán, a state senator and chair of the Arizona Democratic Party. On that issue, Sinema has “fallen short,"" she said.

“She has an incredible ability to work across the aisle,” Terán said. “Let’s see that ability put to work for voting rights.”",Q1

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – Top U.S. senators from both parties on Thursday will grill Democratic energy regulators who recently approved guidelines for approving new natural gas projects that allow consideration of environmental justice, landowner and climate issues.

The three Democrats on the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) voted in February to approve the guidelines that analysts say could present hurdles for new gas projects. The two Republicans on the panel opposed the guidelines.

“@FERC is overstepping its oversight authority on nat gas pipelines & tying our hands behind our back at a critical moment,” Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from natural gas producing West Virginia, said in a Twitter post. Manchin heads the Senate Energy Committee, at which all five FERC members are expected to appear during the hearing.

Senator John Barrasso, the top Republican on the committee, has said FERC’s ruling was “just the latest attack in (President Joe) Biden’s war on American energy.”

Biden only nominated one of the current members of FERC, Willie Phillips, a fellow Democrat, and a former chair of Washington, D.C.’s utility commission.

Criticisms from oil, gas and coal interests and lawmakers from fossil fuel producing states about Democratic policies on climate and pipelines have increased as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to cut exports of oil and gas to the world. Russia produces about 10% of the world’s crude oil.

An interim guideline FERC approved on Feb. 17 requires environmental impact statements on natural gas projects that emit above 100,000 metric tons per year of greenhouse gases, a process that opponents say can be lengthy and unwieldy.

Richard Glick, a Democrat and the head of FERC, said after the approvals that the guidelines would improve the “legal durability” of the panel’s decisions on natural gas projects by ensuring they reflect all stakeholder concerns.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2342925/play-inspired-by-bhagat-singhs-life-staged-at-napa,Play inspired by Bhagat Singh's life staged at Napa,"After a long hiatus due to Covid-19 regulations, the National Academy of Performing Arts (NAPA) opened its door to theatre enthusiasts again. On Wednesday evening, Behrupia, a project by third-year students at the academy, presented a period drama titled Anarkali.

Brilliantly penned by a young writer Ahmed Umar Ayyaz, the politically charged performance was both evocative and moving. Based on true events, Anarkali followed a night spent in terror by two college students after Bhagat Singh, remembered for his sacrifice for freedom, murdered a British police officer in broad daylight. Focused on hostelites Iftikhar Alam and Jatinder Singh from Government College, Lahore, the play remarked on the political presence of students during the era of upheaval and resolution.

Following multiple binaries of contrasting mindsets, the story observed the two kinds of people desiring freedom while residing in colonial India; one who believes in a democratic change while the other in a bloodthirsty revolution. Alam, a political science student finds out in a rather heated argument why his roommate Singh, a science student, believes so strongly in revenge against the white soldiers. Singh yearns for revenge after an innocent fight for freedom cost him his father’s life in the 1919 Jalianwalla massacre.

Directed by Rayyan Khan and Abdul Rehman Rana (who also essayed the lead roles of Alam and Singh respectively), the play successfully explored the tension in the air while having heavy political conversations at the sight of any remorseful action for freedom. A memorable scene from the period drama was when Singh opened up to his roommate about his father’s truth. Often when a family goes through a traumatic event, the trauma transfers to other generations and a new kind of irrational behaviour take over to compensate for the internalised numbness, and all this was beautifully conveyed through the scene.

Singh’s revelation was hauntingly quiet. He chuckled at his fate with his voice breaking at the graphic memory spiking through his head.

However, as soon as the audience was caught in a dispute between revolution and lawful peace, the play ended with a loud bang and gunshots narrating the events that followed Bhagat Singh’s freedom fight. The play concluded with a voice-over telling the bone-chilling incident of public hanging of Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.

While the writing was riveting throughout, the end was disappointing. It felt abrupt and rushed, almost like a significant part of the plot was skipped to spoil the ending. The expressions were engaging but the fast pace of the play made it difficult for the audience to keep up at times. In some instances, the enunciation was unclear as well.

Overall, the play was a rewarding experience nevertheless. Coming from an independent student-run production, it was powerfully executed despite its shortcomings.

A new bill will work to reduce toxic air pollution in Colorado. (Shutterstock)

DENVER, CO — At a press conference at the Capitol on Monday, Colorado lawmakers and climate activists rallied support for a newly proposed bill: the Public Protections From Toxic Air Contaminants Act.

This bill would strengthen clean air protections in addition to those imposed by HB 20-1265 and HB 21-1189, which were passed in 2020 and 2021 and required greater monitoring of air toxins by facilities as well as a warning to communities when spikes in pollution occurred, a news release said. ""The bill will direct the state to establish health-based air quality standards for air toxics, protecting the health of industrial workers, communities of color and working families,"" Lizeth Chacón, Executive Director of Colorado People's Alliance said. ""It will provide an opportunity for the state to ensure that corporations can no longer jeopardize our air quality and health.""

If passed, the bill will limit toxic emissions, strengthen the reporting and monitoring of air pollution and will look at the cumulative impacts of air pollution across the state, Chacón said. The bill will also clarify that the ""Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment may regulate air more stringently than the Environmental Protection Agency. ""Every Coloradan deserves safe and healthy air to breathe, but too many of us — especially in low-income communities and communities of color — are exposed to deadly emissions from polluters that spew chemicals into our air,"" Sen. Julie Gonzales (D) said. ""This legislation both empowers our state to ensure the health and safety of Coloradans and holds corporations accountable for their pollution.""

Becca Curry, a policy counsel for Earthjustice's Rocky Mountain office said in the release that Colorado is in far worse standing compared to other states when it comes to regulating the kinds of air pollutants that are harming communities. ""By passing this bill, the legislature can send a strong signal to the residents of this state that their health and well-being comes first,"" Curry said. ""It should be a no-brainer that corporations be required to report their toxic emissions and get them under control if they are harming people who live near these facilities.""",Q1

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/02/will-hogan-coalition-endure-without-hogan/,Opinion | Will the Hogan coalition endure without Hogan?,"Republicans face a steep climb to statewide office in Maryland even in the best of political environments. Democrats have long enjoyed advantages in voter registration, party infrastructure, candidate training and recruitment, and fundraising. The state’s racially diverse and the large percentage of residents holding a college degree are added benefits for Democratic candidates. And despite some clear strategic errors over the past two election cycles, Maryland Democrats still dominate at every level — with one notable exception.

Indeed, Gov. Larry Hogan’s two statewide victories demonstrate that a Republican can beat the odds. But his electoral success and seven years of enviable public approval ratings shouldn’t be confused with a “purpling” of Maryland; it’s his specific brand that is popular, not his Republican Party.

The winning “Hogan coalition” was built on support from conservative and moderate Democrats, independents and better-than-average margins among Black voters and women, and a unified GOP base. Preserving his coalition in 2022 will take a feat of political strength — and the right Republican.

Advertisement

Among a small group of declared Republican candidates, it’s apparent that Kelly M. Schulz, the former Commerce secretary who has Hogan’s support, understands the mechanics of a viable Republican statewide campaign. She has surrounded herself with some of the same savvy operatives responsible for Hogan’s sharp messaging and electoral strategy. Her recent $1.52 million fundraising haul, though significantly less than some of her Democratic rivals, was the highest among Republican competitors. She also has secured endorsements from nearly every notable Republican elected official in the state.

A Schulz victory would be the first time in Maryland history that a Republican candidate succeeded a two-term Republican governor. It would also break the state’s glass ceiling. Maryland is among the 19 states yet to elect a female governor. Only nine female governors are currently serving; just three are Republicans.

To that point, Schulz leans into some gendered messaging on her campaign website, describing herself first as a wife and mother before noting her status as a small-business owner and a (now former) member of Hogan’s cabinet. And in her first television ad, set to hit the airwaves in the coming weeks, she tells voters that “while I might be running for governor, I’m still a mom. So, I know what it’s like to worry.”

Still, like many Republicans, Schulz generally demurs from embracing identity politics. Even so, she might benefit from a slight gender-based advantage. Scholarly research suggests that female politicians tend to be perceived by voters as more liberal than their male counterparts and, at least in legislative settings, are more effective consensus builders. Both are a net-positive given the contours of the Maryland electorate.

But party still trumps any marginal effect of gender. Thus, Hogan can best assist his chosen successor not only by vigorously campaigning on her behalf but maintaining his current political standing with the state’s voters. Although Hogan has never demonstrated having coattails, a plunge in his job approval rating would almost certainly hinder Schulz’s chances. She still has a long way to go to in convincing voters, particularly Democrats and independents, that she’s cut from the same cloth as her former boss. It remains to be seen whether Schulz can match Hogan in messaging and effectively position herself as another center-right, fiscally focused pragmatist willing to work across party lines.

Of course, Schulz must first win the June primary. And a recent poll conducted on behalf of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) shows a potential problem.

The DGA poll found that Schulz and state Del. Daniel L. Cox (Frederick), one of her GOP competitors, were largely unknown among Republican primary voters. But Cox received a significant boost when the poll informed respondents that he earned the endorsement of former president Donald Trump.

Moreover, most GOP voters preferred a candidate who “embraced Donald Trump’s agenda” over one who could “appeal to Maryland’s diverse electorate.” It’s worth noting that Hogan represents the latter, not the former. However, according to an October 2021 Goucher College Poll, nominating “a Republican like Hogan” would result in a competitive general election contest against either a moderate or progressive Democratic candidate.

To that point, though Trump’s endorsement is a benefit in the Republican primary, it will be a disqualifier for many voters in November. An October 2021 Goucher College poll found “a Republican like Donald Trump” would lose to a progressive or moderate Democrat by a significant margin. This result should come as no surprise: Trump left office with a single-digit approval rating among the Maryland Democrats who comprise a majority of state voters and suffered a 33 point loss to Joe Biden in 2020.",Q1
http://www.truenorthreports.com/roll-call-how-your-senator-voted-on-gun-ban-in-hospitals,Roll Call: How your senator voted on gun ban in hospitals,"Editor’s note: Roll Call is published by the Ethan Allen Institute.

S.30, an act relating to prohibiting possession of firearms within hospital buildings, passed in the state Senate on February 3 2022, by a vote of 21-9.

The purpose of the bill makes it a crime to intentionally carry a gun into a hospital.

Individuals who “knowingly possess a firearm” inside a hospital may be imprisoned for up to 1 year and/or fined up to $1000, in addition to any crimes they may commit with a gun inside the hospital, such as “reckless endangerment.” Hospitals will post signs reminding visitors of this threat.

Analysis: Those voting YES believe carrying firearms in “sensitive places” is not a constitutional right, quoting Justice Antonin Scalia in DC vs. Heller (2008). Firearms are already banned in courtrooms and schools, so hospitals are a natural extension of that logic. A doctor at Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital testified that “they have had incidents in which hospital staff were forced to argue with armed individuals about their 2nd amendment right to carry in the hospital building… the sight of a gun immediately disrupts the health care team at work.” This bill, they say, would reduce the chances of hospital lockdowns, protecting hospital workers and patients undergoing treatment.

Those voting NO believe the threat to hospitals is insignificant – there is no problem here that needs to be solved — and does not rise to a level of just cause to remove rights, enshrined in the US and Vermont constitutions. They point to “testimony that every hospital has a sign out front that says, ‘No Weapons.’” All Vermont hospitals already have “a right to eject” individuals carrying firearms. The threat of losing $1000 or spending 1 year in prison will not deter “anyone with nefarious intent… (due to) this new crime that we’d be creating.” The concept of banning firearms from a “sensitive place” is dangerously vague, and would set a precedent that could be expanded to include almost anywhere people gather. Moreover, “sensitive places” from which firearms are legally barred tend to become “soft targets” for violent offenders.

As Recorded in the Senate Journal, Thursday, March 18, 2021: “Thereupon, the bill was read the second time by title only pursuant to Rule 43. Thereupon, Senator Benning requested that the question be divided and that Sec. 2 be voted on separately. Thereupon, the bill was amended as recommended in Secs 1 and 3 on a roll call, Yeas 20, Nays 9.” (Read the Journal, p.247-249).

https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/can-mongolia-shape-the-modern-world-once-again/,Can Mongolia Shape the Modern World Once Again?,"The Tuul River snakes through the southern edge of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia’s sprawling capital city, coiling westward until discharging into the Orkhon River near the center of the Orkhontuul sum and, ultimately, flowing into Lake Baikal in Siberia, the Arctic, and beyond. Like the Onon and Kherlen Rivers, the Tuul originates in the Khentii Mountains near the sacred Burkhan Khaldun, or “God Mountain.” According to The Secret History of the Mongols – Mongolia’s oldest literary work, chronicling the story of Temujin and his rise to become Genghis Khan (Chinggis Khaan) – the slopes of the Burkhan Khaldun served as a place of refuge, worship, governance, and ultimately burial for the world conqueror.

In the telling of anthropologist Jack Weatherford, Chinggis Khaan was more than an unprecedented and fearsome military leader: He was a nation-builder who embraced the rule of law, protected religious freedom, promoted international trade, and established new diplomatic relations among the great population centers of Asia and Europe. The Mongolian empire connected a formerly disjointed world by creating a “single intercontinental system of communication, commerce, technology and politics.” Due to Chinngis Khaan, the “globe was shaken” and a new order commenced, the historian Edward Gibbon observed.

Today, Mongolia’s reach may be less grand; but while the country faces significant challenges both domestically and regionally, Mongolia remains poised to shape the modern world. Indeed, with the United States as its partner, Mongolia can overcome its obstacles and contribute to building a “free and open” Indo-Pacific.

Tough Neighborhood

Mongolia must deal with substantial structural challenges. As a landlocked country with a population of only three million, the difficulty begins with geography.

All goods leaving or entering Mongolia must traverse the territory and airspace of its two more populous and powerful neighbors, Russia and China. The Trans-Mongolian Railway – Mongolia’s chief rail network – is single-track, extending nearly 700 miles from the Russian border in the north to the Chinese border in the south. When entering China, trains must switch to a new gauge, a time-consuming process.

The Russian government holds a 51 percent stake in Mongolia’s railway, an interest which hinders the development of a more efficient rail transport network. In 2016, Russia sold it 49 percent stake in Erdenet copper mine, which historically served as the country’s most important economic engine. But Moscow maintains a tight grip on the economy, supplying 90 percent of Mongolia’s energy (refined oil). This influence extends to other spheres as well. A walk through Ulaanbaatar reveals the lasting cultural legacies of Soviet rule, from the opera house to the wedding palace to the socialist murals of the Zaisan Memorial.

On the southern border, sharing the wind-swept sands of the Gobi Desert, is China. Approximately 6 million ethnic Mongols live in China’s Inner Mongolia—twice the population of Mongolia proper. With the world’s second largest economy, China receives approximately 90 percent of all Mongolian exports – such as coal, copper and other ores, crude oil, and unprocessed cashmere – and supplies Mongolia with more than one-third of its imports. China is also the country’s single largest source of foreign investment. In the words of a Congressional report, China is “Mongolia’s economic lifeline.”

This dependency has created tensions with China that spill over into other areas. For example, Mongolia has historic links to Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, a title first created by Mongolian leader Altan Khan in the 16th century. In retaliation for the Dalai Lama’s visits to Mongolia, China has temporarily shut its borders with Mongolia and, in 2016, enacted tariffs on Mongolian products. After forcing a promise from Ulaanbaatar not to invite the Dalai Lama in the future, China’s foreign ministry boasted: “We hope that Mongolia has taken this lesson to heart.”

Expanding the Geography

One lesson learned is to expand the neighborhood. Mongolia has turned to “third neighbors” – aligned countries that do not share contiguous borders with Mongolia – for economic engagement and strategic support.

For example, through strong relationships with democratic third neighbors such as Japan and South Korea, Mongolia is working to strengthen stability and cooperation in the region. Uranium-rich Mongolia has been active in supporting nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful resolution of disputes in Northeast Asia. In this regard, Mongolia, which balances diplomatic ties with both North and South Korea, has sought to foster stability on the Korean Peninsula. In early June, during the 6th Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security, Japanese delegates actively sought out North Korean counterparts to lay the foundation for future negotiations on denuclearization of the nearby Korean peninsula. Japan’s efforts are particularly noticeable after the collapse of American summit diplomacy in Danang; although Tokyo’s shuttle diplomacy may be more cautious after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ill-fated trip to Tehran.

Mongolia describes the United States as its “most important” third neighbor and has leveraged its relationship with Washington to shape events on a global scale. For instance, in June, Mongolia and the United States co-sponsored the 17th iteration of Khaan Quest, a military exercise simulating United Nations peacekeeping operations involving contingents from 31 countries, ranging from Australia to Zambia. Admiral Philip S. Davidson, Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, arrived in Mongolia to open the event and underscored the geopolitical significance of Mongolia. Khaan Quest also supports the country’s ongoing participation in United Nations global peacekeeping operations(around 10 percent of Mongolia’s armed forces are serving in oversees UN peacekeeping operations). The interoperability and capacity of the Mongolian military has also been strengthened through important contributions to U.S. military and coalition campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo.

Ulaanbaatar and Washington have also supported shared goals and values in partnerships on the international stage. For example, Mongolia has held the chairmanship of the U.S.-supported Community of Democracies, an intergovernmental organization based in Warsaw that advocates for common democratic values. The countries have also cooperated in the ASEAN Regional Forum. At the United Nations, Mongolia has proven a reliable ally of the United States, consistently voting with the U.S. in General Assembly resolutions. Mongolia has also curried America’s favor by enforcing U.N. Security Council sanctions targeting North Korea’s unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as recognized in the recent U.S. Department of Defense’s Indo-Pacific Strategy Report.

At the same time, Ulaanbaatar has sought to leverage its position to facilitate discourse between Washington and Pyongyang. Over the years, the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue has provided a discrete forum for track one and track two diplomacy. As the only country in Asia to transition from communism to democracy and as a verified “nuclear-weapons-free” zone, Mongolia would be an intriguing locale should there ever be another U.S.-DPRK leadership summit.

The weight of American power also affects the balance of Mongolia’s third neighbor policy. Specifically, Mongolia has reportedly resisted becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), led by Moscow and Beijing, due in part to the signal it may send to Washington and other Western capitals. Similar deliberations and ambivalence impact Ulaanbaatar’s potential participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Indeed, by strengthening ties with the United States, Mongolia can resist the “push and pull” of the region and chart its own course in foreign affairs.

Strengthening the Bond

During Mongolian Prime Minister Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh’s official visit to Washington in September 2018, the countries announced the U.S.-Mongolia Expanded Comprehensive Partnership, which signaled a deepening of the bilateral relationship, particularly in economic and commercial ties. The timing was appropriate. Since 2013, with the drop in global commodity prices and China’s economic slowdown, Mongolia has experienced a relative economic slump. Ulaanbaatar’s skyline may be dotted with tower cranes, but, according to my conversations with locals, many of those construction projects have been stalled since the earlier boom period.

American foreign investment and trade can provide a means for lifting Mongolia’s economy. On June 3, 2019, in Ulaanbaatar, during a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce for Mongolia (AmCham), U.S. Ambassador Michael Klecheski highlighted several challenges for achieving this objective.

First and foremost, Mongolia must resolve and make clear its position on Oyu Tolgoi, the mega-mining project in the south (commonly referred to as “OT”). OT is jointly owned by the Government of Mongolia (34 percent) and Turquoise Hill Resources (66 percent, of which Rio Tinto owns 51 percent). Access to what may be one of the largest copper deposits in the world could be a boon for Ulaanbaatar, which relies on mining revenues to fund at least 30 percent of the national budget.

However, in a bow to economic nationalism, Mongolia’s Parliament has called for renegotiating the terms of OT to seek an increase the government’s ownership stake, thereby injecting uncertainty into the regulatory environment and delaying implementation of the mining development’s second phase. In addition to United States Export-Import Bank financing, the U.S. government must also consider its 35 percent American equity-ownership stake in OT. U.S. Ambassador Michael Klecheski described OT as a “bellwether” for foreign investors – a test of the prospect for tapping the country’s estimated $1.3 trillion mineral wealth, the very future of Mongolia.

Second, Washington is seeking full implementation of the bilateral Transparency Agreement, signed in 2013 and entered into force in 2017. Designed to improve Mongolia’s investment climate, the agreement makes new laws and regulations affecting international commerce subject to a 60-day public comment period and requires those laws to be published in English, similar to the U.S. federal rulemaking process. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) described the Transparency Agreement as representing the “first time that the United States has concluded a stand-alone agreement addressing transparency in matters related to international trade and investment.” During discussions under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in April, the USTR raised concerns that Mongolia was behind schedule in setting up the electronic system for notice-and-comment rulemaking and Ambassador Klecheksi raised the issue again at the AmCham meeting.

Third and more broadly, Mongolia must show progress in battling corruption making regulatory decision-making less opaque. Transparency International, the non-governmental organization that measures public corruption, ranked Mongolia 93 out of 180 countries under the 2018 Corruption Perception Index, alongside Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania in Eastern Europe and Panama and Columbia in the Americas. In its most recent statement on the investment climate, the U.S. Embassy in Ulaanbaatar urged Mongolia to “stem constant, non-transparent amending of legal and regulatory rules, which frustrates Mongolia’s ability to stabilize its business environment and risks losing the FDI Mongolia needs to grow” by taking steps such as “[rooting] out the pervasive corruption threatening the foundational institutions of democracy.” Such actions would also help Mongolia with demands called for under its program with International Monetary Fund.

The United States is attempting to assist in the public reform process by training judges and prosecutors and awarding a second Millennial Challenge Corporation compact. Worth $350 million, the compact will support economic development by improving the water supply of Ulaanbaatar. But more can be done. For example, through the Global Procurement Initiative, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency can assist Mongolia with instituting best practices for procurement and avoid the “debt traps” and corruption that may be associated with other forms of infrastructure development in the region. In addition, Washington can explore using new authority under the so-called “BUILD Act” – signed into law by President Trump last September – to provide alternative investment sources and technical assistance for infrastructure projects.

Interestingly, the U.S. Congress has taken the lead in furthering the economic bond with Mongolia. On April 10, 2019, Congressman Ted Yoho (R-FL) re-introduced the Mongolia Third Neighbor Trade Act (H.R. 2219), which authorizes duty-free treatment for certain articles imported from Mongolia, namely cashmere wool. Mongolia produces over a third of the world’s raw cashmere, but most Mongolian raw cashmere is exported to China, and the United States buys nearly all of its cashmere products from China. Through this legislation, Congressman Yoho and like-minded bipartisan allies like Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) are seeking to bypass China, increase trade between the United States and Mongolia, and strengthen Mongolia’s economic sovereignty. AmCham members visited Washington in late June to meet with the Trump administration and Congressional leaders to push for the new law. Jay Liotta, who serves on AmCham’s advisory board and has been on the ground in Mongolia for the past two decades, described to me the significance of the legislation: “The Third Neighbor Trade Act will build a direct relationship between the American consumer and the Mongolian people, who currently rely upon the industry to provide income to over 100,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, and 80 percent of whom are people below the age of 35.” Indeed, if Mongolia is to build its future, consolidate its democracy and avoid the resource curse, the country will need to diversify its economy, and the United States is in a position to help.

Old Story, New Image

If you follow the Tuul’s stony riverbed to the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, you arrive at Chinggis Khaan International Airport. In the terminal, above the comings and goings of the modern world, hangs a portrait of the 13th century hero with a benevolent gaze. One irony is that Chinggis Khaan himself never allowed his own portrait to be drawn during his lifetime, so his serene repose is merely artistic fancy. Another is that the impact of Mongolia on the contemporary globe, if not misunderstood, is widely underappreciated.

This legacy, like the future of Mongolia, is changing before our eyes. After nearly 70 years as a Soviet satellite state, the country has made a peaceful transition to democracy and embraced free market reforms. Mongolia is now authoring a new chapter in world history. In partnership with the United States, Mongolia can retell an old story with a new image – that of a 21st century state that upholds the rule of law, promotes tolerance, encourages international trade, and bridges diplomatic relations among divided nations. With the promise on its horizon, beneath its eternal blue sky, perhaps Mongolia will someday be said to have left the world “shaken” once again. That would be an irony worth pursuing.

https://www.idsnews.com/article/2022/03/opinion-assata-shakur-civil-rights,OPINION: She who struggles: Assata Shakur and the radical Black women who fought for civil rights,"It is an injustice and an absurdity to label a 74-year-old woman who lives in Cuba a domestic terrorist. But that’s what the FBI did to Assata Shakur.

Shakur, a former Black Panther and civil rights activist was, in my opinion, wrongly convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper in 1977 and given a life sentence.

I say she was wrongly convicted because there’s evidence she wasn’t given a fair trial, with jurors expressing prejudice against her before the trial started and materials related to her case being seized by the New York City police. In her autobiography, she consistently referred to her trial as a “legal lynching.”

But her story doesn’t end there. In 1979, Shakur escaped from prison and fled to Cuba where she was granted political asylum.

Shakur remains in Cuba to this day — she also remains on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists list, being the first woman ever listed. There’s a $1 million reward for information leading to her arrest.

How can the word “terrorism” mean anything at all when it’s applied to both Shakur, someone wrongfully convicted, and people like Osama bin Laden? It would seem the American government is simply using the word in an attempt to delegitimize Shakur’s socialist ideals of economic justice and equality.

The name “Assata” means “she who struggles.” Her story is important for several reasons, the first being that you probably didn’t learn about her in history class. I certainly didn’t, nor did I learn about numerous other Black women involved in the civil rights struggle beyond Rosa Parks.

But more importantly than that, I’d like to defend Shakur and other radical women who have been unfairly demonized by the government and the press for their political views.

“Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his enemy is,” Shakur wrote in her book “Assata: An Autobiography.”

We’ve been duped into thinking Black radicals are our enemies.

Take the Black Panther Party, for example, a former Marxist-Leninist organization dedicated to uplifting the Black community. While Shakur was a member, she was involved with their Free Breakfast for Children program and helped provide free medical assistance for Black people who couldn’t afford healthcare.

But the BPP is not celebrated for this. Instead the Panthers are dismissed and disparaged as violent agitators because of their insistence that Black Americans also have second amendment rights. So often white people with guns are simply portrayed as law-abiding citizens, but if Black people exercise their rights, well, they must be violent criminals.

During the Cold War, the only thing that terrified the U.S. government more than a communist was a Black communist. Activist Angela Davis, for example, was fired by UCLA for being a member of the Communist Party USA, though she was reinstated after public outcry. Like Shakur, Davis was also later charged with murder, but she was acquitted.

The repression of Black communists during the Cold War was staggering — their lives were ruined, their civil liberties were suspended and their influence on public life was crushed.

In 1968, Charlene Mitchell, a member of the Communist Party USA, became the first Black woman to run for president of the United States. You probably haven’t heard of her, and most of America wouldn’t have known about her in 1968 either because she was only on the ballot in two states due to anti-communist election laws. Some democracy!

Shakur, Davis and Mitchell are just three examples of Black women who bravely tried to help the most oppressed people in our society and as a result were met with the most brutal repression. Shakur languishes in Cuba, Mitchell remains in obscurity — Davis alone managed to remain fairly well known, but only after she was subjected to an 18 month jail sentence for crimes she didn’t commit.

Their stories, and those of other women in the civil rights movement must be told, especially the brave radicals who risked everything for liberation. Shakur is not a terrorist, but a revolutionary who struggled to create a better future for her people. We must see her vision through.

https://wtvbam.com/2022/01/28/family-of-ahmaud-arbery-wants-racial-justice-as-murderers-face-new-trial/,Family of Ahmaud Arbery wants racial justice as murderers face new trial,"By Rich McKay

ATLANTA (Reuters) – The family of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger who was chased by three white men in pickup trucks and gunned down in south Georgia in 2020, says that the men’s federal hate crimes trial will do what the state court did not – reckon with race.

The three men – a father and son and their neighbor – were convicted last November in a Brunswick, Georgia state court of murdering Arbery, 25, and sentenced to life in prison.

“That’s not enough,” said Arbery’s father, Marcus Arbery, who believes issues of race raised in the new trial may have an impact beyond the courtroom.

“My son isn’t coming back,” but “maybe it’ll save another Black son,” he said.

Civil rights activists say the new trial, which begins on Feb. 7, is a key moment in the country’s reckoning with racial injustice. Arbery’s murder was another example of deadly violence being used against a Black man, they say.

Gregory McMichael, 66, a former police officer, his son Travis McMichael, 36, and William “Roddie” Bryan, 52, are each charged with interference with rights, a hate crime which carries a maximum of life in prison. All are also charged with attempted kidnapping, and the McMichaels face gun violations.

All three have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Their attorneys have declined to comment to Reuters.

Carol Anderson, an Emory University professor of African American studies who has watched the case closely, said the trial was “absolutely necessary” even though the men had already been convicted of murder.

“We must be clear, it was his blackness that put him in the crosshairs of these men,” Anderson said. “And that makes this a hate crime. This is part of the truth telling that society must have.”

The McMichaels and Bryan told police they thought Arbery was a burglar and that they tried to detain him as he ran through their mostly white Satilla Shores neighborhood. Arbery was shot after a five-minute chase by the men in their trucks. The McMichaels claimed Arbery grappled with the shotgun leveled by Travis McMichael, who fired the weapon.

In the six-week state trial, the prosecution largely avoided race. Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski mentioned it once in her closing arguments. The men attacked Arbery “because he was a Black man running down the street,” she said.

Dunikoski has not commented publicly on why she avoided race. In pre-trial hearings state prosecutors had reserved the option to introduce evidence of racial animus, including Travis McMichael’s vanity license plate featuring the flag flown by the southern pro-slavery Confederacy during the 1861-1865 Civil War. Today it is viewed by some as a symbol of white supremacism and by others a reminder of their Southern heritage.

In an arraignment hearing in 2020, Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Bryan told his office that Travis McMichael uttered a racial slur as Arbery lay dying.

Dial also told the court that he had evidence from social media and elsewhere that Travis McMichael had used racial slurs in the past.

It is not clear whether the vanity plate or Dial’s evidence will be featured in the new trial.

In recent closed-door pre-trial hearings, defense attorneys have argued over what evidence can and cannot be presented to the jury. Court documents on the pleadings have been sealed.

The Oregon Legislature's short sessions—held on even numbered years—are historically unusual. These month-long sessions are often used to fast-track uncontroversial policies or pass emergency budget packages to hold the state over for another year. Despite their swiftness, these sessions are not void of drama: The last time the state held a short session in 2020, Oregon Republicans made sure to cut it shorter by fleeing the capitol over a hotly contested climate change bill.

Yet, 2022's short session remained relatively drama-free for its 31-day stint and, in some cases, saw lawmakers stretching across the aisle to pass bipartisan bills. With a focus on COVID-19 response, climate change, workforce equity, and the homeless crisis, lawmakers were mostly successful in getting priority policies to Gov. Kate Brown's desk by the time the session concluded Friday. Here's a breakdown of what noteworthy bills passed—and which didn't—during this year's legislative session:

Environment

Senate Bill 1536 —

This bill limits landlords’ ability to ban air conditioners and creates a state stockpile of cooling and air filtration units to distribute to Oregon tenants in preparation for future smoke and heat events.

Landlords will no longer be able to ban their tenants from using air conditioners, like in-window AC units, unless there is a legitimate safety concern. For example, a landlord can still ban an in-window AC unit if the unit would be placed in a window used for emergency escape. The bill allocates $5 million to purchase an estimated 4,500 cooling units and 2,761 air filters. The bill also creates $25 million in grants and rebates for housing authorities, organizations, property owners, and more who install heat pumps in their community.

Verde, an environmental nonprofit, worked with legislators to craft the emergency bill in response to the record-breaking heatwave in June 2021 that killed at least 95 people in Oregon. A subsequent study of the deaths in Multnomah County found that most heat wave victims died in their homes without access to cooling devices. Verde worked with landlords and energy providers to craft the bill, which received little to no opposition throughout the legislative process.

“I cared for multiple people [during the 2021 heatwave] who were healthy one day and in the ICU the next suffering with multi-organ failure,” said Portland Representative Maxine Dexter, who is also a physician, while testifying in support of the bill. “These people didn’t make it home and their major risk was simply falling asleep in a room without any ability to cool off.”



Senate Bill 1567 —

Fuel tank owners in Northwest Portland’s Critical Energy Infrastructure (CEI) Hub will be required to conduct a seismic analysis of their tanks by 2024 under this new legislation.

The CEI Hub is a collection of more than 600 industrial fuel tanks placed along the Willamette River in Northwest Portland that stores over 90 percent of Oregon’s liquid fuel. According to a recent Multnomah County study, the hub could also cause one of the largest oil spills in the world during the Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake—the overdue magnitude 9 quake that is expected to devastate the West Coast.

The majority of the oil tanks in the CEI Hub were constructed before modern seismic technology, meaning they are expected to dump all of their contents into the Willamette River and surrounding area during the earthquake. SB 1567 seeks to mitigate the environmental catastrophe by requiring the tank owners to conduct vulnerability assessments on the tanks and seismically retrofit them accordingly.

House Bill 4139 —

This bill requires the Oregon Department of Transportation to create a program that studies how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in construction materials used in transportation projects.

Senate Bill 1533 —

This bill acts as a clarifying follow-up to a bill passed in 2021 that required the Department of Human Services (DHS) to work with local governments to create clean air spaces. In practice, the policy did not permit DHS to partner with tribal governments to create those same spaces. SB 1533 ensures that federally recognized tribes are able to receive the same support for clean air spaces.







Criminal Justice



Senate Bill 1510 —

This piece of legislation prevents police from pulling over drivers for having a single broken tail light, headlight, or brake light. It also requires officers to inform drivers of their rights to refuse a search of their car. The bill was created to limit pretextual police stops that historically have targeted people of color, and is not unlike the recommendation Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell made to officers in 2021.

Among the bill’s supporters were Black Portland legislators Rep. Travis Nelson and Sen. Lew Frederick, who both described being regularly pulled over by police for these types of pretext stops.

“Until my hair started to turn gray, I was pulled over once a year in my neighborhood to ask whether I was lost,” Frederick told his colleagues during a Senate floor vote on the bill.

The legislation also invests $10 million into addiction treatment, mental health services, and other community programs to support people of color after exiting prison.



Senate Bill 1584 —

This bipartisan bill directs money to Oregonians who were imprisoned for crimes they didn’t commit. Specifically, the legislature will pay exonerated individuals $65,000 for each year they spent behind bars and $25,000 for each year spent as a parolee.

Even for exonerated prisoners, the stigma of time in prison impacts a person’s future ability to land a job, a house, and other basic needs. According to the Innocence Project, there are currently 13 people in Oregon who are eligible for this compensation.



Senate Bill 1543 —

Unlike American citizens, undocumented immigrants and refugees in Oregon who are pulled into court proceedings have no right to legal counsel. SB 1543 extends the state’s legal protections for people who can’t afford an attorney to undocumented Oregonians in court for an immigration-related issue. According to immigration law experts, not having an attorney is the single most outcome determinative factor in deportation proceedings. Without a lawyer, people are 5.5 times more likely to get deported than those with a lawyer, according to the ACLU.

“While an immigration court decision should rely on a close analysis of the particular facts and law of the case, we know that the most outcome-determinative factor is simply whether or not an individual or family facing deportation is represented by an attorney,” said Leland Baxter-Neal, an advocacy director with the Latino Network, during legislative hearings.



House Bill 4008 —

This legislation was initially written to approve staffing for a statewide law enforcement discipline program. But that’s not what makes this bill interesting. Lawmakers jammed an amendment into this legislation that would undo restrictions passed last year that limited law enforcement’s ability to use tear gas and munitions on protesters. In brief, this legislation makes it easier for officers to shoot tear gas and impact munitions into crowds of people, as long as it’s “objectively reasonable” to protect against threats to life, injury, or to safely control a dangerous or unlawful situation.

This change was made at the request of Portland city officials, who argued that the 2021 law limiting officers’ use of tear gas and munitions made it difficult for police to do their job.

This bill’s reversal of 2021’s law upset several civil rights groups, including the Oregon Justice Resource Center (OJRC) and the ACLU of Oregon.

“Under the new standard, police with an intent to gas the public need only establish that there is a single person creating a ‘dangerous and unlawful situation,’ a term completely undefined in Oregon law,” reads a statement by the OJRC sent after HB 4008’s passage. ""Requiring that such a term be objectively reasonable does little to clarify what it means for police or the public.”

Both the OJRC and the ACLU are involved in federal court cases challenging Portland officers’ use of tear gas and munitions against Portland protesters in recent years. In a press statement, both organizations pledged to lobby for a ban on tear gas and impact munitions in the 2023 legislative session.







Housing

House Bill 5202 —

The past years have been hard on Oregon’s housing crisis, further widening the divide between those who can afford a home and those who cannot. With the COVID-19 eviction moratorium coming to an end in 2021, state legislators scrambled to pass a $400 million funding package this session to help the thousands of housing insecure Oregonians.

This package, buoyed by the state’s unexpectedly high tax revenue estimates, includes $20 million to improve access to homeownership, $165 million to strengthen homeless services, and $215 million to develop and maintain affordable housing. The proposal includes funds to purchase mobile home parks at risk of closing to maintain affordable housing options, funds for new affordable apartment projects, financial assistance for renovations on low-income housing, and financial aid for low-income homebuyers.

The homeless service dollars associated with this package will go towards outreach work, shelter capacity, hygiene programs, and are prohibited from being used for campsite sweeps or for forcing people to relocate. The bill specifically funnels $10,000,000 towards Multnomah County shelter services, infrastructure, and outreach.







Labor

House Bill 4002 —

One of the legislature’s biggest victories was passing a law granting agricultural workers in Oregon overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The policy impacts the state’s estimated 174,000 farmworkers, hundreds of whom testified before the legislature in support of the bill.

“We are isolated from the rest of society, and being excluded from overtime pay after 40 hours proves it,” wrote Salem farmworker Aracely Avila in her testimony submitted to the legislature. “This exclusion pushes us to the margins of society and it is time for us to be treated with the same equality and justice because we deserve it.”

This legislation was hotly contested at the capitol, with many agricultural leaders arguing that allowing farmworkers the basic labor rights guaranteed in most other industries could put smaller Oregon farms out of business. Yet, the Democratic majority’s support of the bill overcame the opposition.

“I believe it’s time to live up to the constitutional promise of equal protection before the law and bring farmworkers in line with workers in nearly every other industry,” said Eugene Rep. Paul Holvey during the House debate on the bill.

Supporters pointed to the racist history of these overtime exclusions: The 1938 Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was penned during the nation’s Jim Crow era, and effectively excluded the then-majority Black farmworker population from overtime pay.

The legislation comes with over six years of tax credits to farmers to offset the increased costs of overtime pay, which will become fully operational by 2027. With the bill’s passage, Oregon now joins Washington and California in adopting overtime pay policies for agricultural workers.



Senate Bill 5455 —

This legislation creates a number of grant programs aimed at supporting Oregonians who disproportionately experience employment discrimination or other workforce limitations due to their race, gender, age, location, income status, veterans, history within the criminal justice system, or disability status. This bill, a product of Governor Kate Brown’s Racial Justice Council, directs $200 million to new and existing workforce readiness and training programs. It aims to address two issues in Oregon: barriers to job opportunities that exist for people of color and other underserved populations and a shortage in job applicants in industries across the state at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This is a game changing investment, and it couldn't be better timed,” said Duncan Wyse, president of Oregon Business Council, in a press statement. “With the COVID crisis easing, Oregonians are looking for new job opportunities that require new skills. This opens a pathway to more rewarding, better paid jobs, and it makes Oregon more competitive in the bargain.”







What didn’t pass:



House Bill 4147 —

This bill would have allowed Oregonians in prison to register to vote and vote by mail—as is standard for non-incarcerated voters across Oregon—with their ballot counted in the last county they called home before their sentencing. If passed, Oregon would have been technically the first state to abolish prison disenfranchisement in the country, setting the stage for others to follow suit.

Yet, Democratic lawmakers didn’t think they could convince their Republican colleagues—who dubbed the legislation evidence of “Democrats’ shameful pro-criminal agenda”—to support such a contentious bill during 2022’s short session. State Democrats expect to fight harder for this bill’s passage next year.

Senate Bill 1511 —

In 2020, the US Supreme Court ruled that Oregon’s jury system was unconstitutional. That ruling did away with the state’s non-unanimous jury system, one where a person could be convicted for murder if only 10 out of the 12 jurors believed they were guilty. The court found that this policy effectively discriminated against Black defendants and the minority Black jurors sitting on an Oregon jury.

Yet the ruling didn’t make it clear to state courts what people who had been incarcerated by a non-unanimous jury could do to appeal their prior conviction.

SB 1511 would have vacated criminal sentences for any Oregonian who could prove that they’d been convicted by a non-unanimous jury. The bill would direct those cases back to the country of origin, where district attorneys could decide whether or not to retry the case.

Republican lawmakers leaned heavily on testimony from crime victims to inform their opposition to this bill. While the bill was expected to pass on party lines, the legislation never made it to the Senate or House floors—and House Democrats say it’ll have to wait until next year’s legislative session.

It’s a possibility this issue may be resolved before then. The Oregon Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether to retroactively apply the US Supreme Court’s ruling to people previously convicted by a non-unanimous jury in Oregon—and a decision may be announced before the 2023 legislation session kicks off.



House Bill 4141 —

This bill was originally written to phase out the sale of petroleum diesel in Oregon by 2029, replacing it with renewable diesel. According to bill co-sponsor Representative Paul Evans, renewable diesel creates 60 percent less emission than petroleum diesel. The bill was later amended to create a task force to study the availability of renewable diesel and the implications of removing petroleum diesel from the state’s economy. Ultimately, the bill never made it out of the House funding committee.

The shooting happened around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday on the westbound I-580 connector ramp to I-80 in Oakland. CHP officers responded to reports of a crashed vehicle in the area, and as the Chronicle reports, they found one man in the car suffering from a gunshot wound. At 5:00 p.m., CHP announced a closure of the connector while the shooting was investigated.

The victim appeared to have swerved left and hit a guardrail after being shot.

As KTVU reported, via the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, the victim was a 28-year-old man who was in his final month of police academy training to join the sheriff's department. He was reportedly driving home to San Francisco when the shooting occurred, leaving the department's training facility in Dublin. His name has not yet been released.

It remains unclear if the victim was the target of the shooting, or the victim of crossfire.

The sheriff's department posted a video to Twitter just after 9:40 p.m. Tuesday showing deputies in a procession with the young recruit's body on a flag-draped gurney outside Highland Hospital in Oakland.

""Our Deputies have just loaded the body of our young police academy recruit for a law enforcement procession from Highland Hospital to our Coroner’s Bureau,"" the tweet said. ""We are heartbroken and disturbed by this senseless act of gun violence.""

Little information has been made available about the shooting, which remains under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the CHP investigation tip line at 707-917-4491.

A stray bullet in a shooting on I-880 in Oakland resulted in the death of a two-year-old boy in early November. Weeks later, a young woman was fatally shot while approaching the Bay Bridge toll plaza, while her two young sons were in the backseat of the vehicle. No arrests have been made in either shooting.

CHP said that over 80 freeway shootings had taken place on Alameda County freeways in 2021.",Q1
https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/89033-uae-opens-door-for-assads-return-to-arab-fold-analysts.html,UAE opens door for Assad's return to Arab fold: analysts,"A surprise visit by Syria's Bashar al-Assad to the oil-rich United Arab Emirates opens the door to his isolated regime's return to the embrace of the Arab world, analysts say.

The president's trip also showed that a more assertive UAE is willing to upset its ally Washington with a rapprochement with Assad, whose Russia- and Iran-backed regime is accused of crimes against humanity.

The Syrian autocrat's visit to the UAE capital Abu Dhabi last Friday was his first to an Arab state in more than a decade of brutal civil war that has killed close to half a million people.

Assad and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the UAE's de facto ruler, discussed the ""fraternal relations"" between the two countries, the official news agency WAM reported.

Washington was ""profoundly disappointed and troubled by this apparent attempt to legitimise Bashar al-Assad,"" said US State Department spokesman Ned Price, who stressed that ""we do not support efforts to rehabilitate Assad.""

Badr al-Saif, a history professor at Kuwait University, said the UAE has pushed for Syria's return to the Arab fold ""regardless of the role of the regime in the death and displacement of many Syrians"".

He said the bold move reflects the way the UAE -- a wealthy state that has militarily intervened in conflicts in Libya, Yemen and elsewhere -- now sees itself as a regional powerbroker.

""The UAE's self-perception is at the heart of its policymaking,"" Saif said. ""It sees itself as the leader of the Arab world, where it initiates and hopes the rest will follow.

""Its reception of Bashar al-Assad is best understood in this light.""

- Overture to Damascus -

When Assad first launched his bloody crackdown on mostly peaceful demonstrations, plunging the country into civil war from 2011, most Arab countries severed ties with Syria.

Several Gulf states supported rebels fighting against Assad's forces. The regime had all but lost the war when Russia's military intervened on its side in 2015, allowing Damascus to regain most of the territory it had lost.

The UAE has made clear that it opposes the so-called Arab Spring movements, especially in Syria where Islamism, its biggest enemy, was gaining power through jihadist groups.

In recent years Abu Dhabi has led an Arab overture to Damascus as the Assad regime has consolidated power.

The UAE reopened its embassy there in 2018. Hours later, Bahrain said it planned to follow suit. Last November the UAE foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed, visited Damascus.

The Syrian government, for its part, is desperate to revive economic ties with wealthy Arab states after years of war and US sanctions. At least 90 per cent of Syrians live in poverty and more than half have been displaced by war.

""Syria faces huge economic challenges and needs the support of Arab countries,"" said Bassam Abu Abdullah of the Centre for Strategic Studies at Damascus University.

- 'Quite a message' -

The struggle over Syria's role is playing out in an era when the United States has signalled a strategic ""pivot to Asia"", and weeks after Russia stunned the world by launching its Ukraine invasion.

Assad's trip came shortly after a Moscow meeting between the Emirati foreign minister and his counterpart Sergei Lavrov, and weeks after Russia launched its war, which the Assad regime vocally supported.

The UAE and Saudi Arabia have shied away from taking sides, despite calls by Western allies to condemn Moscow, and also resisted pleas to boost energy output to bring down global prices.

Nicholas Heras of the Newlines Institute said the UAE, by embracing Assad, is positioning itself as ""the powerbroker in the Middle East, and in wider Eurasia, that all sides to conflicts can turn to"".

In fostering closer ties with Syria, the Emiratis ""see an opportunity to broker a future order in the Middle East that stabilises the region, because Assad won his civil war and a nuclear weapons power backs him fully,"" he said.

The UAE sees Russia as ""an important player in the Middle East for years to come, and a more predictable external power than the Americans,"" Heras added.

Al-Saif, the historian, said the UAE's moves are actually in line with US calls for its allies in the region to assume more responsibility for their own security.

""The UAE has been engaging in just that, and it means there will not always be total alignment with the US as each state pursues its interests,"" he said.

He added that relations between the US and UAE, a strategic partner that has hosted American troops, will ultimately not suffer from the rapprochement with Syria.

Dalia Dassa Kaye, senior fellow at UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations, pointed out on Twitter that the UAE-Syria normalisation had been underway for some time.

But, she added, ""for the UAE to host this close Putin ally in the midst of the Ukraine war, where Russia is repeating its brutal Syria playbook, is quite a message.""

Speaking to a sea of police officers mourning slain NYPD detective Wilbert Mora, Mayor Eric Adams vowed Wednesday to give them resources to fight the “senseless violence” linked to guns.

“New Yorkers understand the risk and sacrifice you make every day, and we applaud you for that,” he said to those attending the funeral of the young officer at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. “Those of us who have put on the uniform know: What happened to Officer Mora could happen to us any day.”

Adams pledged to step up the battle against street crime that has resulted in several shootings involving citizens and police officers recently. An an off-duty officer was shot and wounded Tuesday night, the eve of Mora’s funeral, while on his way to work. He was not in uniform and not in an NYPD vehicle, the department said.

Last week, Adams, a former NYPD captain, unveiled an action plan to combat gun violence. It calls for more officers on patrol and combating the influx of guns into the city. And it encourages prosecutors to move forward earlier with gun charges.

Mora, 27, and Officer Jason Rivera, 22, were fatally shot January 21 when a suspected gunman opened fire in a Harlem apartment, authorities said. The officers were posthumously promoted to detective first grade at their funerals.

“Our city is going to do more than thank you,” Adams said. “We are going to give you the resources to fight this senseless violence. It is New Yorkers against the killers: And we will not lose.”

“Officer Mora was not only a dedicated public servant, but an exceptional young man beloved by his family, the youngest of four children,” Adams said.

To Mora’s family he said, “I thank you for sharing your son with our city; and you must know we share your grief and feel your sorrow.”

The fallen officer has been praised for his heroism, not only for his duty to protect but for being an organ donor.

Mora was patient and big-hearted, said his brother, Wilson Mora.

“I love how close and loyal you were with your friends, and how much you valued their friendships,” Wilson said. “People gravitated to you because they could lower their defenses and be themselves around you.”

Wilson said he and Wilbert had planned a great number of trips together, and that he “wanted to experience the adventure with you because your love for life was infectious.”

“You chose a life of service to your community and to our adopted country. Your fellow officers were not only co-workers — they were friends and family, and now they’re my family. I love you baby bro, and I will always miss you.”

Karina Mora, Mora’s sister, said her brother’s smile lit up the house.

“Today a light has gone out, painfully, forever,” she said. “How many Wilberts, how many Jasons, how many more officers will have to lose their lives before the system changes?”

NYPD Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell announced during her eulogy that Mora had been posthumously promoted to detective first grade.

“Even through the tragedy of detectives Mora and Rivera, the NYPD will always believe in New York City,” Sewell said.

“And we know that no matter how you refer to faith, the Mora family can hold within themselves the whole-hearted promise that the men and women of the NYPD, the daughters and sons of this city, will forever honor the sacrifice of their own. And we will humbly, unwaveringly, and faithfully carry on the towering and enduring legacy of Detective First Grade Wilbert Mora.”

Rivera’s funeral was held last Friday at St. Patrick’s Cathedral.

The suspect in the shooting of the two officers, Lashawn McNeil, tried to run but was confronted and shot by a third officer on the scene, police said. McNeil died January 24.

That is what is happening to Mike Lindell. It’s unAmerican.

The CEO of My Pillow Mike Lindell has been banned by social-media platforms. Major retailers have stopped selling his products because of his efforts to expose fraud in the 2020 election through documentaries, symposiums, and other activism.

One of those retailers is Bed Bath and Beyond, are closing 37 stores, and are heading for bankruptcy. Karma?

Now they are trying to prevent him from banking in the United States of America.

One of the nation’s largest banks is moving to dump the nine businesses and charities he has founded in the wake of his success with MyPillow.

Among them are the social media sites FrankSpeech.com and Lindell TV, and the Lindell Recovery Network, which helps people overcome addictions, Lindell said in an interview Friday with Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast.”

Bannon played a recording of a telephone call between a top executive at Minnesota Bank & Trust and Lindell’s controller.

It’s truly unbelievable.

The executive asked in the call why the bank, a subsidiary of Heartland Financial, is associated with “someone who could be in the news.” He sees it as a “reputation risk.”

The year 2021 was marked not only by extreme weather events nationwide and in the West — it was also the Earth’s sixth-hottest year on record, federal officials announced Thursday.

The planet’s average land and ocean surface temperature last year was 1.51 degrees higher than the 20th century average, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a report. A separate analysis from NASA also concluded that 2021 was the sixth-warmest year on record and tied with 2018.

Experts from both agencies said the global warming trend was being driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions.

“It’s clear that each of the past four decades has been warmer than the one that preceded it,” said Russell Vose, chief of climate monitoring for the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. “Of course all of this is driven by increasing concentrations of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.”

Last year was the 45th consecutive year that saw global temperatures rising above the average, meaning that the planet has not had a colder-than-average year since 1976, according to the report. What’s more, the years 2013 through 2021 all rank among the 10 warmest years since record keeping began in 1880.

Vose said there’s a “99% chance” that 2022 will also rank in the top 10.

“The punchline here is, it doesn’t really matter how you do the analysis — they all tell you the Earth has warmed quite dramatically over the past century,” he said.

The United States overall fared even worse than the globe, with 2021 ranking as the fourth-hottest year on record in the contiguous U.S., according to NOAA.

Many of the acute warming effects were felt in the West, where exceptional drought, extreme wildfires and simmering heat waves coincided with California’s hottest summer on record.

A heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in June shattered all-time high temperature records in Washington and Oregon, while the Dixie fire, which sparked in July in Plumas County, went on to become the second-largest wildfire in California.

But the region wasn’t alone in its experience, as global warming contributed to significant climate anomalies across the country and the world, including major floods in Germany, sandstorms in Beijing and East Africa’s worst locust plague in decades.

“Unfortunately, we certainly expect to see more of these types of extremes in a warming world,” Vose said. “Some of the events this year were probably not even possible without global warming — or at least they were made much worse by it.”

20 separate billion-dollar disasters occurred in the U.S. in 2021, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

(NOAA)

In the United States alone, there were 20 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters that killed at least 688 people — more than twice the previous year’s death toll of 262, according to the report. Damage from these U.S. disasters totaled about $145 billion.

Among those anomalies were the Texas freeze in February, one of the coldest U.S. events in more than 30 years, and Hurricane Ida, which battered the Northeast with unprecedented rainfall in September and resulted in dozens of deaths. And in December, an outbreak of nearly 70 tornadoes left at least 90 dead across several southeastern states. One tornado was on the ground for nearly 166 miles.

While researchers cannot say those incidents were triggered specifically by rising temperatures, they say global warming exerts an influence over many extreme weather events.

Advertisement

“Many of the heat waves, intense rainfalls and flooding events are going to be found to have a contribution from the human-induced warming,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

An independent analysis by nonprofit research organization Berkeley Earth also found that 2021 was the sixth-warmest year since 1850.

Their report estimated that 1.8 billion people experienced a record-high annual average in 2021, including most of the population of China. A total of 25 countries saw new record-high averages.

Meanwhile, scientists from Europe’s Copernicus observation program ranked 2021 as the globe’s fifth warmest on record.

Officials said last year wasn’t quite as hot as 2020 — which tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record — in part because of a La Niña pattern that persisted through much of 2021. La Niña brings some cool ocean waters to the surface and can contribute to slightly cooler global temperatures.

But overall ocean heat content — which describes the amount of heat stored in the upper levels of the ocean — surpassed that of 2020 to reach a record high last year, according to the NOAA report. The seven highest ocean heat contents have occurred in the last seven years.

“The point is, the oceans are storing a heck of a lot of heat,” Vose said.

Also of concern is the continued loss of Arctic sea ice.

Arctic temperature changes are proceeding three times faster than the global mean, Schmidt said, and sea ice losses have far-reaching effects because melting glaciers and ice sheets add to rising sea levels and contribute to permafrost thaws that release carbon — essentially “amplifying feedback on climate change.”

“The last seven years seem kind of anomalous, but we’ve reached a point where the global warming data we’re talking about here is no longer an esoteric or academic measure of what’s going on, but it’s being reflected in the weather and the events that we’re seeing,” he said.

For years, scientists and world officials have urged limiting the increase in global average temperature to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Vose said there is now a 50/50 chance that at least one year during this decade will reach that threshold, and that average global temperatures will almost certainly exceed it in the 2030s or early 2040s.

“We’re not there yet, but we’re approach that point, and the trajectory is unlikely to change as long as we keep emitting greenhouse gases,” he said.

Greenhouse gas mitigation efforts could help stall the arrival of that moment, but probably cannot reverse it altogether, because carbon dioxide emissions can linger in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Advertisement

“If we get to net zero for carbon dioxide, and we reduce the other greenhouse gases as well, then we can stabilize temperatures,” Schmidt said. “It’s not going to cool, but it wouldn’t keep getting worse.”

While the 1.5-degree Celsius limit is significant, it’s not as if the effects of climate change haven’t already begun, he said, noting that more effects are likely in the years to come.

“We will see more and more extreme heat waves and more intense rainfall and more coastal flooding,” Schmidt said. “It may not be the Pacific Northwest next year, but it will be somewhere, and we obviously have to be prepared.”",Q1

Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) plans to run for reelection to a third term, a Republican source confirmed for FOX6 News on Friday, Jan. 7. According to multiple media reports, the announcement could come next week.

Johnson was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010 by defeating Democrat Russ Feingold. He was reelected in 2016 – after again defeating Feingold.

Several Democrats have already announced they are running to replace Johnson in the Senate. They include Milwaukee Bucks senior vice president Alex Lasry, state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson, Millennial Action Project founder Steven Olikara, and Wausau physician Gillian Battino.

Johnson has been coy about his intentions for months, but recently has indicated that he would announce his decision soon.

The senator pledged in 2016 not to run for a third time, but he rescinded that promise and kicked around running again for months, saying circumstances changed when Democrats took full control of Congress and the White House.

Johnson emerged as one of former President Donald Trump’s loudest defenders in 2020, particularly after his election loss, and that support continued after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Just before the Capitol was stormed a year ago, Johnson objected to counting the Electoral College votes from Arizona.

Trump endorsed Johnson in April and encouraged him to run.

Many potential Republican candidates have been waiting on Johnson before deciding whether to run. Former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy announced this week that he was not running for Senate or governor. Former Marine Kevin Nicholson, who lost a Republican primary for Senate in 2018, has said he would run for governor if Johnson seeks reelection.

""Wisconsin voters will relish the opportunity to fire Ron Johnson, who has used his senatorial power to enrich himself and his wealthiest donors at the expense of the middle class. Johnson’s relentless attacks on working families, health care, and the bedrock principles of American democracy disqualify him from a third term, and his presence on the ballot will ensure that voters turn out in record numbers to defeat Republicans at every level.""

State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski

""Ron Johnson has failed Wisconsinites–looking out for corporate special interests and promoting conspiracy theories, not helping us. Beating Ron Johnson is going to take a commonsense candidate who is focused on the kitchen table issues that matter to Wisconsin families and knows how to win–and I’ve got what it takes to get the job done.""

Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes (D-Wisconsin)

""Ron Johnson has been a failure and Wisconsin voters know it. The only people cheering Johnson's decision are the wealthy special interests and big donors who have made a killing during his time in Washington. He promised to stand up for working families, but instead opposed critical economic relief for families and small businesses, while helping to write the law that gives millions in tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy. Ron Johnson has made clear that he’s corrupt, out of touch with Wisconsinites, and can't be trusted.""

CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) — Two men are charged in the fatal shooting of a Cedar Falls man during the weekend. Police say 19-year-old Arthur Craig Lang was killed in the shooting on Sunday. Twenty-five-year-old Brandon Javon Mitchell, of Mason City, was charged Monday with attempted murder, intimidation with a weapon and felon in possession of a weapon. His bond was set at $100,000. And 24-year-old Daniel Martez Judon, of Mason City, was charged with intimidation with a weapon in the shooting. His bond was set at $25,000. Police say the shooting occurred during a confrontation between pedestrians and the two suspects and Lang, who were in a vehicle.

MARION, Iowa (AP) — Police arrested a 22-year-old Marion man after authorities ruled the death of his infant son was a homicide. Samuel Goodwin was arrested Monday on possible charges of first-degree murder and child endangerment causing death. He is expected to be formally charged on Tuesday. Goodwin’s son died on April 4. Police and emergency workers responded to a report of an infant who was not responsive and not breathing. Attempts to save the boy were unsuccessful. An autopsy concluded the baby’s death was homicide, caused by multiple head injuries.

PACIFIC JUNCTION, Iowa (AP) — Census data shows that in the three years since devastating 2019 spring floods submerged Pacific Junction in southwest Iowa, the town’s population has shrunk from 475 to less than 100. Now the question is whether it will remain a town. Pacific Junction Mayor Andy Young recently told Omaha, Nebraska, television station KETV that he’s hopeful the town will see families coming back. Dozens of empty lots around the town are the result of federal buyouts, which stipulate a new home cannot be built on the property once the old one comes down.

MILFORD, Iowa (AP) — Authorities say a woman who was shot twice last week in the parking lot of a Milford medical staffing office where she worked has died. Now a man who was arrested shortly after the shooting faces a murder charge. The Sioux City Journal reports that 25-year-old Shelby Wiozeschke died Sunday at a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, hospital where the mother of two was flown after being shot Thursday morning. Police say the shooting happened in the parking lot at GrapeTree Medical Staffing and that Wiozeschke called 911 and identified 25-year-old Christian Goyne-Yarns, of Spirit Lake, as the person who shot her. Goyne-Yarns was arrested about 90 minutes after the shooting on suspicion of attempted murder. He’s now charged with first-degree murder.

IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — An Iowa woman is grateful the state Board of Parole reversed its decision to give early release to the man who fatally shot her son in 2017 after a judge clarified that he sentenced the man to serve 24 years in prison. Shafona Jones told The Gazette in Cedar Rapids that she’s glad Johnson County Attorney Janet Lyness followed up with the judge after the parole board granted Lamar Wilson, 28, work release in September. Wilson was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and several other charges in the August 2017 shooting on Iowa City’s pedestrian mall that left Jones’ son dead and two others injured. Wilson didn’t deny firing the gun, but he argued he fired the shots in self-defense.

https://www.today.com/news/3-men-convicted-murdering-ahmaud-arbery-sentenced-life-prison-rcna11411,3 men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery sentenced to life in prison,"The three white men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man, in Georgia were sentenced Friday to life in prison.

The sentences for Travis McMichael, who shot Arbery; and his father, Gregory McMichael, do not carry the possibility of parole. Their neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan will be eligible, however, Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley said.

All three men were convicted of murder and other charges by a Glynn County jury in November in the pursuit and fatal shooting of Arbery on Feb. 23, 2020.

Walmsley called Arbery’s killing “callous” and said it occurred because “confrontation was being sought.”

Before announcing the sentences, the judge asked the courtroom sit in silence for one minute to illustrate, he said, a fraction of the estimated time Arbery was running in terror from the men before he was killed.

“He left his home to go for a run and ended up running for his life,” the judge said.

The sentences are in line with the request from prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, who recommended that Bryan get a chance at parole and that the McMichaels be denied that possibility. Dunikoski said the father and son showed no remorse or empathy for “the trapped and terrified Ahmaud Arbery.”

Defense attorneys argued in favor of parole for all three men.

An attorney for Travis McMichael said he “should have the opportunity to show that he’s grown, to show that he’s changed.” The attorney, Robert Rubin, said that a parole parole board should determine if and when Travis McMichael is released from prison.

Arbery’s parents and sister, who spoke before the sentences were handed down, asked the judge to give the men the maximum punishment allowable.

“The man who killed my son has sat in this courtroom every single day next to his father. I’ll never get that chance to sit next to my son ever again. Not at a general table. Not at a holiday. And not at a wedding,” Ahmaud Arbery’s father, Marcus Arbery, said before the sentence was announced. “His killers should spend the rest of their lives thinking about what they did and what they took from us and they should do it behind bars because me and my family have to do it for the rest of their life.”

The McMichaels armed themselves and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck after seeing him running in their neighborhood, Satilla Shores. Bryan joined the pursuit in his pickup truck and recorded video of the fatal encounter on his cellphone.

The McMichaels and Bryan had been charged with one count of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count each of false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony.

Travis McMichael, who fired at Arbery three times at close range, was convicted of all nine charges. Gregory McMichael was convicted of all charges except malice murder. Bryan was convicted of three counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony.

The nearly all-white jury deliberated for about 10 hours before delivering its verdict.

The malice murder and felony murder convictions both carry a minimum penalty of life in prison. Attorneys for all three men have said they intend to appeal the convictions.

Prosecutors said Arbery ran from the men for five minutes. Arbery was eventually trapped between the two pickup trucks and ended up in a confrontation with Travis McMichael, who was armed with a shotgun.

The McMichaels and Bryan were free for several weeks after the shooting. They were arrested only after the video that Bryan recorded was released and the case was taken over by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

From the beginning, the handling of the case by local officials was called into question by Arbery’s family and friends. Arbery’s killing, along with that of George Floyd, sparked protests against racial injustice in America and beyond.

Attorneys for the men, each of whom had their own defense team, had argued that the men suspected Arbery was a burglar in an area that they claimed was “on edge.” Arbery was recorded on security camera video visiting a partially built home in the neighborhood several times. The videos did not show him taking anything from the property. The last video was recorded the afternoon he was killed. The defense had sought to convince the jury that the McMichaels and Bryan were trying to execute a citizen’s arrest, which was legal at the time in the state.

But lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski challenged that narrative. In her closing argument, she said Arbery had not committed an offense in the presence of any of the men and that they decided to “attack” him “because he was a Black man running down the street.”

“Who brought the shotgun to the party?” she said. “You can’t create the situation and then go, ‘I was defending myself.’”

Prosecutors did not argue that race motivated the killing but all three face federal hate crime charges.",Q1

The Panesar brothers Kheerat, Vinny and Jags made their EastEnders debut in 2019, before being joined by sister Ash and mother Suki in Albert Square one year later

Since the Panesar family first joined EastEnders, they have become embroiled in a lot of huge storylines - including the final hurrah of serial killer Gray Atkins.

With matriarch Suki in the midst of a sleepwalking storyline causing concern in Albert Square, the Panesars are never far away from drama and its repercussions.

‌



Still struggling after her recent mugging and the fallout from her relationship with Honey, will Suki get the help she so desperately needs?

The actors' real lives away from the soap are probably a little less dramatic than their Walford counterparts – though there's still plenty of juicy gossip to get your teeth stuck into.

How Did the Crash Happen?

Maine Department of Public Safety spokesperson says the incident happened at approximately 9:20 Wednesday morning. Maine State Police Trooper Robert Flynn was stopped near mile marker 1 in the southbound breakdown lane of I-95 in Kittery behind a flatbed truck that was being towed for a mechanical issue. The blue emergency lights on Trooper Flynn's vehicle were activated. The driver of the National Towing flatbed was underneath the truck, trying to fix the mechanical issue.

Suddenly, a tractor-trailer driven by 52-year-old Johnny Rogers of Canastota, New York drifted into the breakdown lane and struck Trooper Flynn's cruiser. The tractor-trailer then veered back into the travel lanes, ending up in the far-left lane where it struck and pinned a Jeep Cherokee against the concrete barrier in the median. The Jeep contained a husband and wife and their two children.

Was Anyone Hurt?

The National Towing driving suffered no injuries in the crash. Trooper Flynn and the family from the Jeep suffered minor injuries and were evaluated at the Portsmouth Regional Hospital. The driver of the flatbed truck had exited his vehicle while it was being worked on and was struck by a piece of debris from the police cruiser. That driver is being evaluated for what are believed to be minor injuries.

Is the Tractor-Trailer Driver Facing Charges?

Rogers is charged with failure to move over for an emergency vehicle and distracted driving.

Several lanes of traffic were shut down while the vehicles were removed.

Skyhobo/Getty Images

(WASHINGTON) — As the impacts of global climate change exact an increasingly dire human and economic toll, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday is considering a major challenge to the power of the Environmental Protection Agency to combat greenhouse gas emissions from thousands of American power plants.

The justices are hearing oral arguments in a case — West Virginia v. EPA — that pits major coal and mining companies and Republican-led states against the Biden administration, power utilities and public health groups that see EPA’s authority as critical for curbing the climate crisis.

The outcome of the case could determine whether the U.S. will be able to meet a government goal of cutting carbon pollution by 50% over the next eight years and shifting entirely to clean energy sources by 2035, experts say.

“We need every tool in the toolbox to address climate change,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund. “An action [by the Court] here is a real setback.”

The landmark Clean Air Act of 1970 charged the EPA with protecting human health from dangerous airborne contaminants, which the Supreme Court has twice affirmed to include greenhouse gasses.

The law lets the agency craft pollution limits based on the “best system of emission reduction” available, but there is disagreement over whether the law prohibits consideration of measures “outside the fence line” of a particular plant, such as shifting to alternative sources of power generation or emission trading programs.

The U.S. power sector is the nation’s second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Plaintiffs in the EPA case claim the agency is seeking to “reshape the power grids and seize control over electricity production nationwide,” according to court documents, a characterization the government disputes.

The justices will first need to decide whether there’s even a live dispute worth adjudicating. While the case originated as a challenge to the Obama administration’s 2015 Clean Power Plan, that policy was subsequently put on hold and has never taken effect.

The states and coal companies argue that a lower court decision, if allowed to stand, effectively empowers the EPA to threaten entire industries and tens of thousands of American jobs. The Biden administration says the warnings are premature, noting its emission guidelines have not yet been published, much less enforced.

“Petitioners are seeking a ruling on what EPA might do in the future, but federal courts do not have jurisdiction to decide cases on what could happen,” said Andrew Restrepo, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club. The states and coal companies “do not and cannot explain how they would be injured.”

The Supreme Court showdown comes the same day the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a new report of impending catastrophic harms from the unchecked rise in carbon pollution.

“What we’re arguing about is the scope of the means, or the way the [EPA emissions] standard can be constructed,” said David Doniger, an attorney with the National Resources Defense Council and former EPA lawyer. “We want EPA to be able to look at a range of measures beyond efficiency tuneups” at power plants.

A decision against the agency could also have implications for the ability of other government agencies to set health and safety regulations across entire sectors of the nation’s economy, legal analysts said.

Conservative legal scholars, including several members of the high court, have long argued that major administrative rules governing American life must be specifically approved by Congress in order to be legal.

Last month, the justices blocked the Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers on those grounds, while last summer the court rolled back the CDC’s pandemic eviction moratorium as an illegal overreach.

“If there are enormous decisions that have vast political and economic significance, Congress — if they want an agency to deal with it — should speak clearly to that issue,” said Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA official who served during the George W. Bush administration and has represented clients challenging recent EPA emissions regulations.

There are more than 3,300 fossil fuel-fired power plants in the U.S., including 284 coal-fired facilities, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. An estimated 1.7 million Americans work in fossil fuel industries, from mining to pipeline construction to electricity generation.

In a landmark 2007 decision, Massachusetts v EPA, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote authorized the agency to regulate greenhouse gasses as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Four years later in American Electric Power v. Connecticut, the justices again affirmed that “Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.”

Doniger said if the Court rolls back that authority a “huge swath” of the regulatory state could potentially be upended by extension.

“Legislation that people rely on to structure their businesses or protect themselves from predatory business practices, fraud in commercial transactions, in the securities market — all of that would seem to be imperiled if this is imperiled,” he said.

In a friend-of-the-court filing in the case, a coalition of medical groups, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians have implored the justices to take a broad view.

“Climate pollutants’ most grievous harms beset children and families, pregnant women, people over 65 and communities of color and of low income,” they wrote.

“The Court should be mindful of Congress’s decision to provide EPA regulatory authority to address this type of threat to public health. Any retrenchment in the scope of that authority would inflict further harm to the health of current and future generations.”

Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”, and that the Kremlin would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”.

Ukraine’s president said that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks, “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”.

Has Russia halted attacks as promised? The mayor of Chernihiv, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said the Russians had lied and were continuing to indiscriminately attack the encircled city, which is less than 100 miles north of the country’s capital.

Why is Abramovich playing peacemaker after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? The emergence of the publicity-shy oligarch at the heart of peace negotiations has surprised many.

What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 35 of the Russian invasion.

Records show long gap in Trump phone logs as January 6 violence unfolded

The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is reportedly looking at a “possible cover-up” of White House records focusing on Donald Trump’s phone logs from that fateful day, which bear an unexplained gap of seven hours and 37 minutes covering the period when the violence was unfolding.

Documents obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News put flesh on the bones of one of the great mysteries of January 6: why White House phone logs contain holes in the record despite evidence the then president busily made calls at the height of the insurrection.

The documents reveal that Trump’s diary shows an entry at 11.17am when he “talked on a phone call to an unidentified person”. The next entry is not until 6.54pm – 457 minutes later – when Trump asked the White House switchboard to place a call to his communications chief, Dan Scavino.

Between those times Trump addressed a rally on the Ellipse, exhorting supporters to “fight like hell”; hundreds of Trump followers overran police barricades and stormed the Capitol building.

What did the Washington Post journalists say? Bob Woodward (of Watergate fame) and Robert Costa reported that the long gap between call logs was of “intense interest” to elements of the January 6 committee. They quoted an unnamed member of the panel who said they were investigating a “possible cover-up”.

Joe Biden signs landmark law making lynching a hate crime

View image in fullscreen Joe Biden signs the Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act in the Rose Garden of the White House. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

The first federal legislation making lynching a hate crime, addressing a history of racist killings in the US, became law yesterday.

The bill, passed by the Senate this month, is named afte Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was brutally murdered in Mississippi in 1955. Joe Biden signed the bill surrounded by Kamala Harris, members of Congress and top justice department officials. He was also joined by a descendant of Ida B Wells, a Black journalist who reported on lynchings, and Rev Wheeler Parker, a cousin of Till.

The bill makes it possible to prosecute as a lynching any conspiracy to commit a hate crime that results in death or serious bodily injury. According to the bill’s champion, the Illinois congressman Bobby Rush, the law lays out a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and fines.

Why has it taken this long to bring in? Congress first considered anti-lynching legislation more than 120 years ago. Until March of this year, it had failed to pass such legislation nearly 200 times.

What did the vice-president say? “Lynching is not a relic of the past. Racial acts of terror still occur in our nation. And when they do, we must all have the courage to name them and hold the perpetrators to account,” she said.

No human activity is more multi-sensory than eating, but to eat in the modern world is often to eat in a state of profound sensory disconnect, writes Bee Wilson. We order groceries on a computer, or takeaways on a phone, and they arrive wrapped in plastic. Vegetables are sold pre-chopped and almost all salad is pre-washed. Any hint of the soil the food grew in has been erased. We judge the goodness of food by the words on the packet rather than by our own senses. It shouldn’t have to be this way.

The Covid-19 pandemic sparked a number of shake-ups to the social order – a burgeoning anti-work movement, a sharp economic swoon, and tiresome new polarities in the culture war. But as lockdown orders marched on, many weed agnostics dived in to the community with gusto, forming a new cohort of pandemic-era stoners. According to the data analytics firm Headset, legal marijuana sales increased by 120% in 2020, and 61% in 2021.

In a press release, the California Department of Corrections said Durst, 78, died of natural causes while being treated at a hospital. In October, Durst contracted COVID-19, days after being sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for killing his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000.

Durst has long been suspected of being responsible for Kathleen Durst’s disappearance, a case he was indicted for last year on charges of second-degree murder. Robert Abrams, the McCormack family lawyer, said following his death he plans to reveal more information.

“Although Robert Durst has died, the ongoing investigation into those who helped him cover up her murder continues,” Abrams said in a statement, according to multiple reports. “On January 31, 2022, the 40th anniversary of Kathie’s murder, we will provide a further update. In the interim, please say a prayer for Kathie and his other victims.”

Kathleen McCormack Durst, a graduate of New Hyde Park Memorial High School, disappeared in 1982 at the age of 29. In 2017, she was declared legally dead by a Manhattan court.

Durst, who in the 2015 HBO miniseries “The Jinx” was recorded saying, “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course” on a hot microphone, denied the allegations. Kathleen McCormack, the youngest of five children, married Durst in 1971.

Seven years ago, McCormack’s sisters and then-101-year-old mother filed suit in state Supreme Court in Mineola against Durst, alleging that he had murdered Kathleen McCormack Durst and caused the family “extreme emotional distress, humiliation, mental and physical anguish, as well as economic losses” by keeping her body hidden.

Prosecutors claimed Durst first murdered Kathleen Durst, who was looking to divorce him, and years later shot Berman to cover his tracks. Berman, a journalist, was found dead in 2000 on Christmas Eve, lying in a pool of blood after being shot in the back of the head in her Los Angeles home.

Efforts to reach a member of the McCormack family or Durst’s legal team for comment were unavailing.

Durst was also acquitted in the 2001 slaying of Morris Black, his elderly neighbor in Galveston, Texas, whose body was dismembered with an ax and bone saw. Prosecutors tied the Black slaying to alleged attempts by Durst to cover his tracks.",Q1

Columbus police were first called Friday afternoon to a residential area on the city's East Side, where 41-year-old Dalin Green was found shot dead inside a vehicle. On Saturday morning, police were dispatched to a home on the Northeast Side where Floyd W. Bacon, 34, was found dead outside from a gunshot wound.

Homicide map: Here's an updated map of where homicides have occurred in Columbus

With Bacon's and Green's deaths, 18 people have been killed as of Sunday in Columbus so far in 2022.

As the first two months of 2022 near an end, the rate of killings in Columbus has slightly dipped when compared with the previous year, the city's deadliest on record and the second consecutive year that a record number of homicides were recorded.

By the end of February in 2021, 33 people had become victims to homicide. Last year initially ended with 204 recorded homicides, but that figure grew by one last Thursday when Columbus police announced that the death of a 17-year-old in October is now being classified as a homicide.

Green was found dead when Columbus police were dispatched at 2:39 p.m. Friday to the area of Sweet Basil Drive and Tarragon Way on a report of gunshots. When they arrived, police found a fatally-wounded Green inside a vehicle that had crashed, and a Whitehall medic pronounced Green dead at 2:52 p.m.

A 34-year-old woman was also inside the vehicle but was not struck by gunfire, police said.

Homicide detectives said they are working to obtain surveillance video of the area that might provide information on any suspects behind the fatal shooting.

The following day, Columbus police were dispatched at 11:14 a.m. Saturday on a report of a dead male lying in a back yard of a home on the 1900 block of Oakland Park Avenue, east of Cleveland Avenue. Bacon was found unresponsive with a gunshot wound, and medics arrived to pronounced Bacon dead at 11:20 a.m.

Police have identified no suspects in either homicide.

Within the month of February, shootings raged in neighborhoods around the city and even inside and outside popular commercial businesses.

On Feb. 18, an 18-year-old man was shot and killed at a Roosters restaurant at 2454 East Dublin-Granville Road (Route 161) in the city's Northland neighborhood. And on Feb. 14, a 24-year-old man was permanently paralyzed from the waist down after police say he was the victim of an apparently random drive-by shooting as he sat inside a front window at Dick's Den, a bar and live music venue in Columbus' Old North neighborhood.

Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther declared gun violence a public health crisis in mid-February and announced the formation of a coalition intended to pressure Ohio and U.S. lawmakers to take action to get illegal guns off city streets. During the Feb. 15 news conference in which Ginther announced those steps, he also indicated that a long-anticipated violence intervention strategy is expected to launch at the beginning of March.

Ginther first announced at a previous fall news conference that the city would implement the National Network for Safe Communities' Group Violence Intervention (GVI) program, which requires leaders to engage with the most-dangerous people in the city to convince them to give up their violent ways and connect them with social services.

When asked about the initiative by a Dispatch reporter at the news conference, Ginther said city leaders and community groups involved in the outreach program have met several times and are prepared to host the first so-called ""call-in"" with at-risk individuals as early as Tuesday.

https://www.canadianminingjournal.com/news/ranked-worlds-top-10-copper-mining-projects-2022/,RANKED: World’s top 10 copper mining projects – 2022,"Copper, often called the bellwether metal as a barometer of global economic health, is a metal vital to the green energy transition. Demand has been growing for the red metal, and energy and metals researcher Wood Mackenzie expects end-use copper demand from passenger EVs to jump to around 2.9 million tonnes over the next decade from about 600,000 tonnes in 2021.

For a snapshot of the copper supply chain of tomorrow, MINING.COM and sister company Miningintelligence compiled a list of the top 10 largest undeveloped copper projects and ranked them according to copper resources in the measured and indicated and inferred categories.

Based on our criteria, we excluded Udokan Copper’s Udokan in Russia, Zijing’s Timok in Serbia and Anglo American’s Quellaveco in Peru, which have moved into the construction and commissioning phases.

#1 Pebble

Development status: Preliminary Economic Assessment. Geology: Porphyry, Supergene Copper

Northern Dynasty Minerals’ Pebble project in the Bristol Bay region of Alaska leads the list by a distance, containing 37.18 million tonnes (mt) of copper. Pebble has been plagued with controversy, delays and environmental opposition over the years, and the project’s key water permit was formally rejected by the US Army Corps of Engineers last year.

This year, the Biden administration said it will relaunch a process that could permanently protect Bristol Bay from development. The decisions are currently being challenged by Northern Dynasty Minerals, and in October 2021 the company released a preliminary economic assessment. If permitted, Pebble would be North America’s largest mine.

#2 Resolution

Development status: Feasibility. Geology: Porphyry

Rio Tinto and BHP’s Resolution copper project in Arizona comes in second with a 27.7 mt copper resource. The world’s top two miners have spent $2 billion over 26 years trying to launch Resolution into production, but have faced continued opposition from Native American groups and environmentalists. A 2014 decision by former President Barack Obama and Congress set in motion a complex process to give Rio federally owned Arizona land that contains more than 40 billion pounds of copper and would be one of the world’s largest underground mines.

#3 La Granja

Development status: Advanced Exploration. Geology: Porphyry

Rio Tinto’s La Granja property in Peru is in third place with 22.06 mt of copper. Rio Tinto acquired La Granja over 12 years ago, but renewed the concession in 2019 and paid $5m to continue exploring. The same year, it was rumored that Rio may team up with First Quantum to develop the mine.

#4 KSM

Development status: Prefeasibility. Geology: Porphyry, Skarn

Seabridge Gold’s Kerr-Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM) project in British Columbia is in fourth place with 21.25 mt of copper. The $5.3 billion project hosts four mineral deposits that will be operated as a combined open-pit and underground mine. Late last year, Seabridge announced its plans to reshape KSM by integrating the Snowfield porphyry deposit, acquired from Pretium Resources in December 2020.

#5 Nueva Union

Development status: Prefeasibility. Geology: Porphyry

Teck and Newmont’s Nueva Unión 50/50 joint venture in Chile takes fifth place with a 16.69 mt copper resource. The project is located in the Atacama region, and annual copper production is estimated at 224,000 tonnes during first 5 years of production.

#6 Tampakan

Development status: Feasibility. Geology: Porphyry

The Tampakan deposit on the Philippine island of Mindanao is in sixth place with 15.25 mt of copper. Sagittarius Mines is seeking local approval for the proposed mine, which is estimated to yield an average of 375,000 tonnes of copper a year over a 17-year mine life.

#7 El Pachon

Development status: Advanced Exploration. Geology: Porphyry

Glencore’s El Pachón copper and silver project in San Juan Province Argentina takes the seventh spot with a 15.04 mt resource. Glencore acquired the project from Xstrata Copper – El Pachón is a major long-life development project with the potential to initially produce 400,000 tonnes of copper per year.

#8 Los Azules

Development status: Preliminary Economic Assessment. Geology: Porphyry, Supergene Copper

McEwen Mining formed a new company, McEwen Copper, to advance the 13.42 mt Los Azules project in Argentina. The first thing the company said it intends to do is construct a new, low-altitude northern access road to provide year-round access to the site. The current exploration road is only passable about five months a year.

#9 Twin Metals

Development status: Prefeasibility. Geology: Magmatic Sulphide

Angofagasta’s beleaguered Twin metals project in Minnesota rounds out the top ten with 12.96 mt of copper. The company has asked US officials to reconsider a proposed 20-year ban on mining in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters region, a plan announced last fall that would block Twin Metals altogether.

#10 Frieda River

Development status: Feasibility. Geology: Epithermal, Porphyry

Guangdong Rising’s Freida River project in Papua New Guinea rounds out the list with a 12.45 mt resource. Freida River’s estimated mine life is 20 years.

https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1243432.html,How placenta blocks Covid transmission to babies during pregnancy,"New York, Feb 1 : While Covid-19 disease significantly impacts many pregnant women, the rates of transmission from mother to baby in pregnancy are very low.

A new study from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) has demonstrated that ACE-2, the receptor that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, is found in lower levels in the placentas of women with Covid-19 in pregnancy compared to women with normal (Covid negative) pregnancies.

The findings appear online in the American Journal of Pathology.

""We think that when a woman has Covid-19 in pregnancy, the placenta is shedding off ACE-2 as a way to block SARS-CoV-2 from being passed to the fetus,"" said Elizabeth S. Taglauer, Assistant Professor of Paediatrics at BUSM.

In the study, the team involved collecting placentas from two groups of women who delivered at BMC from July 2020-April 2021.

The first group was women who had normal pregnancies and no report of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The second group of women were SARS-CoV-2 positive and had active Covid-19 disease during pregnancy.

The researchers, then, observed the ACE-2 expression in their placentas under the microscope and compared placental ACE-2 expression using genetic and protein analysis techniques.

According to the researchers, the placenta has many similarities with the lung, so this study also highlights the importance of studying it to help understand a variety of lung diseases and highlights the important role of controlling ACE-2 as a way to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.

""The placenta is one of the few 'success stories' of the pandemic. If we understand how the placenta is naturally protecting babies from Covid-19, this may provide important information for therapies and strategies to help prevent other SARS-CoV-2 infections from continuing to spread,"" added Taglauer.

Two days after a Minneapolis SWAT team member shot and killed Amir Locke while serving a no-knock search warrant in a downtown apartment, Minneapolis Jacob Frey imposed the moratorium on the request and execution of no-knock warrants in the city Friday evening.

""No matter what information comes to light, it won’t change the fact that Amir Locke’s life was cut short,"" said Frey in the news release. ""To ensure safety of both the public and officers until a new policy is crafted, I’m issuing a moratorium on both the request and execution of such warrants in Minneapolis.""

But the ban includes an important exception: ""To execute a no-knock warrant under the moratorium, there must be an imminent threat of harm to an individual or the public and then the warrant must be approved by the Chief,"" Frey says.

Locke, a 22-year-old Black man, was not the subject of the search warrant the Minneapolis SWAT Team was serving to assist St. Paul Homicide Division. Authorities have not said which investigation the search warrant was connected to.

Body camera video shows that Locke was wrapped underneath a blanket on a couch when police entered the apartment at 6:48 a.m. Wednesday. Locke, whose family and attorneys have said he had a permit to carry, is seen starting to raise himself up from under the blanket with a firearm in his hand when Officer Mark Hanneman shot him three times.

No-knock warrants in Minnesota

Minnesota law states, ""a search warrant may be served only between the hours of 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. unless the court determines on the basis of facts stated in the affidavits that a nighttime search outside those hours is necessary to prevent the loss, destruction, or removal of objects of the search, or to protect the searchers or the public.""

The practice is often used by law enforcement agencies to surprise suspects that might otherwise be confrontational, or mitigate the risk of potential evidence destruction. Minnesota law requires police to outline why they cannot use a regular ""knock and announce"" warrant, and two high-ranking officials in the police agency must sign off on the application.

RELATED: No-knock warrant in Locke case raises questions about Minnesota search law

In the aftermath of the Breonna Taylor murder in Baltimore that caught national attention for its use of a ""no-knock"" warrant, on the campaign trail Mayor Jacob Frey criticized the use of such warrants and pledged Minneapolis would reduce the use of them, if not eliminate the practice entirely.

Frey had not placed a ban on ""no-knock"" warrants, but then-police chief Medaria Arradondo restricted their use via a policy change in November 2020.

In his first public comments about the shooting, on Friday Gov. Tim Walz called for ""further reform"" to Minnesota's no-knock warrant law.

Whether or not legislators will address the state law this session remains to be seen, though calls to address the issue are increasing from both sides of the aisle.

https://www.stabroeknews.com/2022/01/13/news/guyana/dpp-advises-police-to-charge-rank-over-boston-killing/,DPP advises police to charge rank over Boston killing,"The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has advised the police to charge the rank who allegedly shot and killed Dartmouth businessman, Orin Boston at his home almost four months ago with manslaughter.

Stabroek News was reliably informed that the case file was returned to the police today with the recommendation for the rank, who inflicted the deadly wound to be charged based on the evidence gathered during the investigation.

The police had forwarded the file earlier this month to the DPP Chambers for legal advice.

Boston, 29, of Hoppie Street, Dartmouth, Essequibo Coast was shot and killed on September 15, last year during what was said to be an anti-crime operation by the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) squad.

More than a week after the incident, police had confirmed that the file was sent to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) for a “review”.

In a statement, the police had said that ranks from the SWAT unit were conducting the operation at around 4.40 am during which they went to the home of Boston to undertake a search.

During the search, the police said there was a “confrontation” between Boston and the police, resulting in him being shot.

Boston was rushed to the Suddie Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. An autopsy later revealed that Boston died as a result of haemorrhage and shock due to gunshot injuries to the chest.

Boston’s family through their attorney, Nigel Hughes had indicated their intention to file private criminal proceedings in the matter.

However, just recently, Hughes told Stabroek News that the police were refusing to release the name of the shooter to the family so that a private criminal charge could be laid.

Hughes said the family believes that this is being done to prevent the institution of private criminal charges against one of the force’s own.

“We have written on three occasions to the Commissioner (of Police) asking him for the name of the officer who shot Mr Boston because we would like to proceed with criminal charges against him…..He refused to answer,” Hughes had said.

Due to the absence of the rank’s name, Hughes was unable to proceed with the private criminal charges.

Hughes had previously told this newspaper that the family was giving the authorities up to November month-end to disclose the findings of the probe before they proceed with charges.

Prior to this, he had written to Commissioner of Police (ag) Nigel Hoppie and Chairman of the PCA, Justice (ret’d) William Ramlal in relation to the investigation. To date, he has not received any response.

Hughes had initially stated that while the option of private criminal proceedings is “always available”, they would prefer for the state to “discharge its responsibility to investigate and prosecute what is clearly a crime”.

Boston’s widow, Feona Boston, had told reporters that the police kicked down their back door, went into their bedroom and shot the businessman. She said that ranks were all over the house with guns and her two children, ages 6 and 7, witnessed the entire ordeal.

Just over a week ago, Feona told Stabroek News that she remained “lost” about the matter.

She said she lost hope and does not believe she will receive any justice. “I say like this thing just finish just like that because I ain’t get no call from nobody or so. So I just like I don’t know, I give up,” Feona said.",Q1

Pennsylvania: Lab monkeys escape from truck after crash

A truck crash in the US involving the transportation of around a hundred monkeys to a laboratory has sparked infection fears after a woman who came in contact was warned over diseases.

The test monkeys were on their way to a laboratory in Florida when the truck crashed into a garbage truck on Friday near Danville, Pennsylvania, with four of the primates escaping.

‌



The incident allowed four monkeys, confirmed to be macaques, the chance to make a break for it as they managed to escape from their containers.

According FOX 56 Wolf TV, three monkeys were captured and ""humanely euthanized according to American Veterinary Association guidelines"" but the reports only sparked further concerns.

The incident has fuelled reports of the monkeys carrying an infection after a woman was warned as she stopped to help the animals, believing they were cats.

Michele Fallon, from Danville, told FOX 56 Wolf TV that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said she should monitor her health for any type of symptoms of an infectious disease after being close to them.

She said: “I have anxiety, so I just know I'm going to be a nervous wreck for the next 31 days.""

Police previously advised members of the public to not actively look for the animals and to not attempt to catch it or come in contact with it.

No further information on why these instructions were given but residents were asked to call the police if they did see the macaque.

Writing on Twitter, an account run by State Troopers Andrea Pelachick and Lauren Lesher, gave an update on the incident.

""Anyone who sees or locates the monkey is asked not to approach, attempt to catch, or come in contact with the monkey. Please call 911 immediately.”

The message from the troopers prompted a number of users to comment on the post with many concerned others whether the monkey was “infected” with something.

Ashling Murphy, 23, was assaulted and killed while out for a run on the Grand Canal Walk in Tullamore, Co. Offaly, last Wednesday, an unsolved crime that has shocked the Irish people at home and abroad.

The grievers gathered in the Supreme Realty parking lot at the rear of Greenhills Bakery in Dorchester’s Adams Corner for the vigil, organized by the Irish Pastoral Center (IPC). Holding lighted candles despite a heavy breeze, the crowd of adults and children gathered to hear mournful Irish music and recite the rosary. Music was provided by members of the Boston chapter of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann .

News about the murder continues to dominate media coverage across Ireland since last week’s gruesome killing. No one has yet been charged in the murder. Sunday’s gathering here in Dorchester parallels similar vigils across Ireland and in New York, London and Australia.

The tragic murder resonated personally for Cindy Quinn and her husband Dermot, owners of Greenhills Irish Bakery. Ashling’s sister Amy Murphy spent a summer several years ago with them ago working at their bakery, she said.

“Amy and a friend of hers taught music to Dermot’s niece in Ireland,” Cindy recalled this week. “That‘s how she connected with us when she had a J-1 visa to work in the US.”

She recalled meeting the Murphy parents when they visited Boston.

“I hope they will take some comfort knowing that so many people here came out for the vigil,” she said. Funeral services took place in her hometown on Tuesday morning.",Q1

(Alexis Tarrazi/Patch)

NEW JERSEY — One of New Jersey's most well-known serial killers Charles Cullen, also known as ""The Angel of Death"", is the focus of Netflix's latest film.

""The Good Nurse"" set to be released this year follows actress Jessica Chastain who suspects her colleague Cullen, played by Eddie Redmayne, is responsible for a series of mysterious patient deaths, Netflix tweeted recently. The Netflix storyline is based off a book with the same name ""The Good Nurse"" by Charles Graeber which chronicles Cullen's murderous career.



Cullen is suspected of killing 400 patients over his 16-year career as a nurse. He was only convicted of the murder of 29 patients at nine New Jersey and Pennsylvania hospitals.

In New Jersey, Cullen worked at Saint Barnabas Medical Center, Warren Hospital, Hunterdon Medical Center, Morristown Memorial Hospital and finally Somerset Medical Center (now called RWJ University Somerset Hospital) where 13 patients were killed, according to nj.com.

Arrested in December 2005, Culled was sentenced to 11 consecutive life sentences in New Jersey and six more life sentences in Pennsylvania in 2006. He is not eligible for parole until 2403, according to nj.com. Both Academy Award-winning actors, Chastain is best known for her work in Zero Dark Thirty, Interstellar and Molly's Game. Redmayne is known for Les Misérables, The Theory of Everything, and Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.

No specific release date on the film has been announced.

https://krforadio.com/true-or-false-its-illegal-to-privately-own-buffalo-in-minnesota/,True or False: It's Illegal to Privately Own Buffalo in Minnesota,"In short, it's entirely within the law to privately own buffalo in Minnesota as long as you possess all necessary local permits and follow all local zoning requirements.

There was a time when bison were abundant in Minnesota and the plains of the Midwest. By some estimates, there were as many as 30-60 million bison (bison used synonymously with buffalo, though technically very different than buffalo according to the Minnesota Buffalo Association) roaming North America. By 1900, however, settlement and slaughter had reduced that number to just a few captive herds. Today, there are an estimated 500,000 bison in the country, about 150 of them scattered around Minnesota, most notably found at Blue Mounds State Park in Luverne, Minneopa State Park in Mankato, the Minnesota Zoo and the Zollman Zoo.

But what about privately-owned bison herds, like the one I pass at Minnesota Native Landscapes in Otsego on my way to and from work every day? Are there rules about owning bison in Minnesota?

Get our free mobile app

According to the Minnesota Buffalo Association (MNBA), it is legal to own and raise bison in Minnesota as long as all proper protocols are followed:

Local County or Township Zoning regulations dictate where livestock operations are allowed. Agriculture Zone Districts are areas where raising livestock is allowed. If you are beginning with an existing farming operation, make sure that you would be allowed to continue or be “Grandfathered In” for your intended use. If it is a new operation you will need to acquire the appropriate local permits to begin after meeting all the zoning requirements for the location. Checking with local zoning officials should be your first step.

Few other details regarding the legality or permitting of owning bison are available, though the MNBA does provide plenty of other helpful information on raising bison, proper care, selling of live animals and meat and tourism.

Minnesota's DNR is currently working to build back the state's bison population to 500 by gradually building up a network of parks that can host anywhere from a few to a hundred bison.

WORCESTER, MA — The longest nurses strike in Massachusetts — and one of the longest in the nation this year — is over after 301 days.

St. Vincent Hospital nurses on Monday voted to approve a new contract with their employer, an agreement that includes a return-to-work provision guaranteeing that nurses who went on strike can return to their original jobs. The final vote was 489 in favor and nine opposed, according to the Massachusetts Nurses Association union. The agreement between the nurses at St. Vincent, which is owned by the for-profit Tenet Healthcare Corp., came after two years of negotiations — including many sessions held during the strike, which began on March 8. The final agreement was hammered out in mid-December with former Boston mayor and U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh acting as a mediator.

With the agreement ratified, nurses should begin returning to work by Jan. 22, according to a St. Vincent spokesperson. ""Tonight’s vote is an historic victory for the heroic nurses at St. Vincent who refused to budge until they secured the protections and staffing conditions their patients deserve,"" U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Fitchburg, said in a news release after the vote. Trahan and every other member of Congress from Massachusetts supported the nurses. ""They wanted nothing more than to return to work for months, and they risked their livelihoods on the picket line each day to achieve that goal.""

The nurses' main goal during the strike was to increase staffing levels across all parts of the hospital. The hospital agreed to reduce the number of patients assigned to each nurse in many areas. ""For nearly 10 months our nurses have walked the line for safer patient care, for the honor of our profession and for the right of all workers who make the difficult decision to engage in a lawful strike to return to their original positions,"" nurse and union leader Marlena Pellegrino said. ""As we stand here tonight, we can proudly say we have achieved our goals.""",Q1

UOregon media / https://media.uoregon.edu/channel/archives/991 In a still from a U of O video from March 5, 2010 Emmilee Risling - of the Native American Student Union - talks about Indigenous issues with fellow student panelists.

33-year-old Emmilee Risling was last seen crossing a bridge in October. An accomplished Hoopa Valley tribal dancer, 2014 University of Oregon graduate, and mother, she’s one of five cases in 18 months of Native women gone missing or found murdered between California's Bay Area and the Oregon border.

“Everyone wants her home,” Emmilee’s sister, Mary, told KLCC. “Everyone who my sister touched, misses her. And wants to see her back with her children.”

Risling said she’s been frustrated with the attention paid to other cases, like the disappearance-homicide case of Gabby Petito last year. Critics have noted that Petito - a young and attractive white Instagrammer – garnered national headlines for weeks, while MMIW cases have rarely made a blip in social media and traditonal media save for tribal newspapers. Risling said both law enforcement and the public need to focus more on cases like this one.

“It’s just a helpless feeling. Indigenous women. You know there’s statistics out there, but…given the fact that the cases don’t get much attention, there would be a lot more information if they did.”

A flyer shares last known details of Emilee Risling before she disappeared Oct. 18, 2021.

Risling added that Emmilee struggled with mental health issues in the months ahead of her disappearance, and that can add another layer of stigma.

“The amount of times my sister has been picked up over the years by the (Humbold County) sheriff, it’s like, ’Let’s get her in trouble, but let’s not help her.’ When police officers have a certain number of run-ins with a person, and they go missing…they have this stigma over who this person was, or who they thought she was.”

The Yurok Tribe has declared a state of emergency. They want California to form a comprehensive database of cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people. MMIW advocates have long called attention to conflicting sources of data in trying to track cases, with varying definitions or thresholds.

Meanwhile, the Risling family appreciates opportunities to spread awareness of Emmilee’s disappearance, and of missing and murdered Indigenous women in general.

“Whatever it takes to help get the word out,” Gary Risling told KLCC, after granting permission to use his missing daughter’s U of O graduation photo. “We want the word to spread far and wide about the challenges in helping investigate and solve these cases.”

A group called Sovereign Bodies Institute has set about doing its specialized research on missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two Spirit (MMIWG2) cases, and noted that California – with 150 - ranked fifth in the nation, with more than a third of cases in the northern half of the state.

Another challenge facing relatives, women’s advocates, and tribes, is the question over jurisdiction. And red tape.

“We’d reached out to the BIA for support and other federal organizations, and until the sheriff’s department classifies it as a cold case, federal organizations can’t help,” said Mary Risling.

“We all feel helpless.”

Anyone with information on Emmilee Risling's disappearance or whereabouts can call Hoopa Tribal Police Dispatch (530)625-4202.

These scores are usually used to determine graduation, third grade retention, school grades and teacher evaluations.





Hillsborough and Miami-Dade Counties have already sent letters to Florida’s Secretary of Education Richard Corcoran asking him to waive testing requirements.

Now, Orange County Schools has drafted a similar letter that will be sent out this week.

Superintendent Barbara Jenkins says the district continues to face widespread teacher and student absences because of Omicron which could negatively impact these scores.

""The Delta and Omicron variants have had a huge negative impact on student and teacher attendance this school year since January 4, 2022.""

Jenkins says it’s simply not fair to ask students to perform well on these tests when kids have been out sick with COVID for large parts of the year.

""We believe this level of learning disruption justifies flexibility under state and federal accountability systems.""

Waiving these testing requirements the last two years hasn’t improved graduation rates much in the state. Only 90.1 percent of students got a diploma in 2021, compared to 90 percent in 2019.

That's a 0.1 percent improvement.

https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2022/01/19/rutilio-grande-mental-health-treatment-242227,Father Rutilio Grande: the (future) patron saint of breaking mental health stigma?,"Rutilio Grande, S.J., who will be beatified on Jan. 22, was a deeply committed priest with extraordinary pastoral gifts. This was apparent particularly in his efforts to empower the laity and bring the spirit of the Second Vatican Council—as well as the Latin American Bishops’ Conference in Medellín, Colombia—to life in impoverished El Salvador during the lead-up to that country’s civil war. Not content to impose solutions from above, Father Grande was committed to what Pope Francis would later call “the culture of encounter.” Because of his efforts to raise the consciousness of the poor and advocate for land reform, he and two parishioners were gunned down by a death squad in 1977 less than one month after Óscar Romero had been installed as archbishop of San Salvador. Father Grande’s assassination had a profound effect on Archbishop Romero, who spent the rest of his life speaking boldly and prophetically against oppression until, he, too, was killed by a death squad.

Father Grande’s work was possible because of the care and treatment he received for his mental health issues. Though a less known part of his biography, this is highly relevant in an age when so many struggle with their mental health. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, one in five Americans suffers from a mental illness in any given year. Despite the vast scope of this crisis, which has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, there is significant stigma around mental health care, particularly in the church.

Rutilio Grande is just the intercessor we need as we seek to bridge the gap between the beautiful theory of church teaching on mental health care and its actual practice.

Our last three popes have spoken frequently about the dignity of those struggling with mental health issues including depression and addiction, and Pope Francis has spoken positively about his own experience seeing a psychoanalyst. But that attitude of compassionate care has been slow to trickle down into the average parish, where there can still be a temptation to dismiss or over-spiritualize mental health issues in ways that implicitly or explicitly discourage medical care. Rutilio Grande is just the intercessor we need as we seek to bridge the gap between the beautiful theory of church teaching on mental health care and its actual practice.



The Jesuit historian Rodolfo Cardenal’s definitive biography of Father Grande describes in detail his two major mental health crises during his time in Jesuit formation, which are brought to life by letters and documents from the archives of the Central American Province of the Jesuits. The first crisis occurred while he was teaching at a Jesuit school in Panama. He was overwhelmed by the stress of his workload, first appearing passive and then speaking unintelligibly. He was admitted to a clinic, where he was diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia, received treatment and recovered. Aware of his fragile health, Grande’s Jesuit community sent him to recuperate in El Salvador, and afterward his superiors were careful to take his needs into account when making his assignments. (He did better, for instance, in smaller communities than in large Jesuit houses.) Archival documents indicate that he was given extra time to complete his formation, and the vice provincial superior insisted that he be given an egg for breakfast every day and that he have access to the kitchen at all hours to regain his physical strength. He continued to see psychiatrists and receive medical care as arranged by his Jesuit brothers, who delighted in his recovery.

Rutilio Grande bore mental health issues as his personal cross. Now he can become a patron saint for all Catholics who seek and deserve mental health care.

Although several private letters written by fellow Jesuits (preserved in the archives) attest that some of them doubted that Grande had the capacity to complete his formation, no one told him that he was unfit to be a Jesuit. In fact, in their care for him, the Jesuit community beautifully embodied the Ignatian principle of cura personalis, or care for the whole person. They respected his dignity by working to meet his mental, physical and spiritual needs.

[Related: Burned out, overworked or depressed? Pope Francis is praying for you.]

The second crisis came before Father Grande’s ordination to the priesthood, when he was tormented by scrupulosity: He worried that his doubts about his vocation had made him unworthy to be a priest. Although he was reassured by his superiors, this fear gripped Father Grande for some time, until he began to understand his mental health issues as his personal cross and moved into a place of self-acceptance. That self-acceptance gave him the freedom to step wholeheartedly into his pastoral work and, eventually, to lay down his life for his people.

The medical treatment and extraordinary community care given to Father Grande restored him and made him capable of his great work. How impoverished the church would have been without his powerful witness! But the church still has much work to do in order to follow in the footsteps of the Jesuits of El Salvador who cared for Father Grande. In spite of the church’s merciful teaching on mental health care, people struggling with depression, anxiety or any of a host of other mental health issues are still being given the message that their conditions are shameful, that they should just pray harder, or that therapy and medication are sinful things to pursue. Imagine the saints that might have been, had they not been made to feel unworthy or unwelcome in the church.

As we work toward a more informed, inclusive and compassionate church, Rutilio Grande is a perfect patron for us, giving us a powerful reminder that mental health concerns are not a disqualification from holiness, from a fulfilling vocation or from a life lived in the depths of the mercy and compassion of God. All of us are called into communion with God. May we commit to building a church that allows us all to say yes.

The 16-year-old Bryant was shot and killed by police as she swung a knife at two other people on Tuesday, April 20, 2021, in Columbus, Ohio. Prosecutors have announced that a grand jury declined to charge the police officer who fatally shot Bryant. (Ma'Khia Bryant/Don Bryant and Paula Bryant via AP, File)

The Columbus police officer who shot and killed 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant last year has been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, Ohio prosecutors announced Friday.

Bryant was killed in April by Columbus police officer Nicholas Reardon as she swung a knife at a young woman, just seconds after pushing another woman to the ground. Bryant was Black and Reardon is white. Police were responding to a 911 call made from Bryant's foster home about a group of girls threatening to stab members of the household.

The killing led to a Justice Department review of the police department in Ohio’s capital city.

Bryant was shot four times and died from her injuries. The coroner listed the cause of death as a homicide — a medical determination used in cases where someone has died at someone else’s hand, but not a legal finding. It doesn’t imply criminal intent.

Bryant’s killing further heightened tensions in Ohio's capital city over fatal police shootings of Black people, and also cast a light on the state’s foster care system.

In announcing the grand jury decision, special prosecutors Tim Merkle and Gary Shroyer noted, “Under Ohio law the use of deadly force by a police officer is justified when there exists an immediate or imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or another.” They said the decision followed a full review of the shooting.

The woman Bryant was attacking, Shai-onta Craig, had formerly lived at the home but had returned and argued with her that day, according to Craig's statement to police released Friday.

Reardon told investigators he didn’t think using mace or a “hands-on” approach would have worked because of the knife in Bryant’s hand, because he thought he was the only officer on scene and because Bryant appeared much bigger than him.

“At the time I fired my weapon, I was in fear for the life of the female in pink,” Reardon said, referring to Craig.

The city will now conduct an internal review to determine whether Reardon's actions followed department policy, the Columbus Public Safety Department tweeted.

Bryant's family expressed disappointment that Reardon wasn't charged and said in a statement: “There should have been other non-deadly options available to deal with this situation.” Her family also called for “full-scale changes"" to Ohio's foster-care system to prevent similar tragedies.

“Ohio’s foster care system is failing our children and we cannot stand by and allow this to continue,” the statement said. “As the one-year anniversary of Ma’Khia’s death approaches, her family is resolute in their fight for justice on her behalf.""

Foster parent Angela Moore told investigators that neither Bryant nor her sister, who was also in the home, had ever displayed violence, but all the girls in the home periodically argued.

A week after Bryant’s death, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther invited the Justice Department to review the police department for possible “deficiencies and racial disparities.”

The U.S. Justice Department accepted, and last fall agreed to review practices of the police department, saying its Office of Community Oriented Policing Services would conduct a review of what the department called technical assistance in such areas as training, recruitment including a focus on diversity and creating an early intervention system for officers.

Columbus — the country’s 14th largest city — has recorded several contested police shootings, including the 2021 killing of 27-year-old Miles Jackson in an emergency room; and the 2020 shooting death of 47-year-old Andre Hill.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Two policemen accompanying population census teams have been killed in separate attacks in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

In one of the incidents, a group of attackers on Monday ambushed a police vehicle carrying nine men, Waqar Ahmed, the district police official of Tank district, told Al Jazeera.

“There were 10 to 12 attackers who were hiding in a water channel, from which they started firing on our mobile. The police retaliated but one constable, Khan Nawab, died in the exchange of fire,” Ahmed said.

Four other police officers were wounded in the attack, including two who suffered serious injuries and were transferred to the provincial capital of Peshawar for treatment.

In a statement on Monday evening, the Pakistani military’s media wing said security forces chased after the attackers and killed a “terrorist commander” it identified as “Abdul Rasheed alias Rasheedi”. It added he was wanted by police for involvement “in numerous terrorist activities” against the security forces as well as the killing of civilians, without elaborating.

The other attack took place on Monday afternoon in Lakki Marwat district, about 86km (52 miles) north of Tank.

It was carried out “by two hooded men who rode a bicycle and opened fire on the census team, which resulted in death of constable Dil Jan”, Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Shahid Hameed told Al Jazeera.

The attackers managed to flee after killing the official, Hameed said.

There was no claim of responsibility for either attack.

Pakistan on March 1 kicked off its seventh census, a data-gathering exercise that is expected to last until April 1.

The country has recently seen a rise in attacks on its security forces by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an armed group also known as the Pakistani Taliban, after it unilaterally ended a ceasefire agreement with the government in November last year.

Among its many demands, the TTP seeks stricter enforcement of Islamic laws, the release of its members from government custody, and a reduction in Pakistani military presence in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province bordering Afghanistan.

It also seeks to reverse the 2018 merger of Pakistan’s tribal districts with neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Q1

PHOTO: AFP

JAKARTA (AFP, REUTERS) - A prominent Indonesian militant linked to the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people on the resort island has been sentenced 15 years in prison, a judge at a Jakarta court ruled on Wednesday (Jan 19).

Aris Sumarsono, better known as Zulkarnaen, was a former military commander in Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a South-east Asian jihadist network with ties to al Qaeda.

The 58-year-old had been on the run for almost two decades after being named a suspect in the Bali attacks.



The blasts, which came just over a year after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, ripped through two bars packed with foreign tourists, and remain the deadliest militant assault in Indonesia’s history.

Zulkarnaen, a high-ranking member of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant group, was on trial for the Bali bombings as well as several other attacks carried out by a special unit under his command.

He “is guilty of committing terrorism and is sentenced to 15 years behind bars”, said the presiding judge at East Jakarta District Court, punishing him for assisting militants, hiding information about attacks and his association with the JI cell.

The 58-year-old Zulkarnaen had been on Indonesia’s most-wanted list since the bombings, having evaded authorities for nearly two decades until his arrest in December 2020.

Indonesian prosecutors had said Zulkarnaen set up the special JI cell and described him as a “key asset” for the group because of his experience as a trainer at militant camps in Afghanistan and the Philippines.

During the trial, Zulkarnaen denied involvement in the Bali bombings, but admitted they were carried out by his team.

He told the court that JI operatives did not tell him about the attack in advance and that he was not involved in specific planning. But the judges were not convinced.

“The fact that he was the head of the team and agreed on a plan in Bali... it could be considered agreeing to the plan,” the presiding judge said.

The court also flagged other attacks by Zulkarnaen’s cell during the sentencing, including a 2000 attack on the Philippines embassy, and a series of church bombings.

His unit was also tasked with inciting ethnic and religious violence in Sulawesi and Molucca islands, where thousands were killed between 1998 and 2002, according to the police.

The prosecution had sought a life sentence, and said it would appeal. Zulkarnaen appeared in court via video link because of coronavirus rules.

“It was down from a life sentence to 15 years so my client accepted it,” said his lawyer Kamsi, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.

Al-Qaeda links

Zulkarnaen was among the top leaders of JI, which was founded by Indonesian militants exiled in Malaysia in the 1980s.

The group grew to include cells across South-east Asia, and also developed links with international Islamist groups.

It has been designated a foreign terrorist group by several nations, including the United States and Australia – which lost 88 nationals in the Bali bombings.

JI and Al-Qaeda have a “common ideology”, according to a UN Security Council sanctions entry on the South-east Asian group, and “many members of the two organisations have a shared experience of training or fighting in Pakistan and Afghanistan during the late 1980s and early 1990s”.

Zulkarnaen was one of Al-Qaeda’s “point men in South-east Asia” and “one of the few people in Indonesia who have direct contact” with the group, according to the US State Department’s Rewards for Justice programme, which offered a bounty of up to US$5 million (S$6.75 million) for him.

JI was nearly dismantled by Indonesian authorities after the Bali bombings, but the organisation has been rebuilding.

Its spiritual leader, the firebrand preacher Abu Bakar Bashir, was released from prison last year after serving a jail term for helping fund militant training.

Indonesia has suffered numerous terror attacks since the Bali bombings, and is home to dozens of extremist organisations – including some loyal to the Islamic State group.

https://www.ktvq.com/news/montana-news/corrections-dept-relents-on-initial-5k-grant-to-exonerated-man,Montana Corrections Department relents on initial $5K grant to exonerated man,"HELENA — The state Department of Corrections has changed course and paid an exonerated Montana man his $5,000 “transition assistance grant,” as he attempts to become the first person to gain state compensation for a wrongful conviction under a new law.

Cody Marble, 37 of Conrad, said he received the payment late last month – seven weeks after the Corrections Department initially told MTN News he wasn’t eligible for the money.

However, Marble said this week he had yet to receive or get any response about a rental voucher the law says he should get while his case is under way.

The Department of Corrections has not responded to several requests from MTN News about the status of Marble’s rental voucher.

Mike Dennison-MTN News Cody Marble (left) of Conrad, exonerated on a rape conviction after 14 years in the Montana prison system, speaks last year before an interim committee drafting a bill to compensate those wrongly convicted. He's the first person to file a claim under the new law.

Marble, convicted of rape in Missoula in 2002, was exonerated in 2017 after spending more than a decade behind bars. He denied the crime ever happened, saying he’d been set up by fellow inmates at the county juvenile detention center.

Last spring, the Montana Legislature passed House Bill 92, which created a process under which people wrongly convicted and imprisoned for crimes they didn’t commit can get compensation from the state.

Marble became the first person to file a claim under HB92 in late September in state District Court in Missoula. Marble could be eligible for as much as $800,000 in addition to two years of tuition assistance at a Montana state college and a year of health insurance coverage.

The new law also says claimants are supposed to get $5,000 from the state Department of Corrections as a “transition assistance grant” when they intend to file a claim and within 30 days of being released from imprisonment. Yet two months after Marble filed the claim he had not received the money.

In response to an inquiry from MTN News, state Corrections officials last December said Marble was not eligible for the grant because it was meant only for people released from prison after the new law took effect. Marble had been released from prison in 2016.

But about three weeks later, Corrections officials reversed course saying Marble would get the $5,000 if he provided “specific documents,” which he had done.

Marble said he had to sign a waiver of any other claims against the state and complete a 1099 tax form so the payment could be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.

The law also says the state “shall provide a housing voucher” to any claimant while a claim is pending. Marble said neither he nor his landlord had received any response about the rental voucher.

In order to be eligible for a claim, Marble had to drop a federal court lawsuit against the state and Missoula County seeking damages for his wrongful conviction. He also must prove his innocence in the case in a legal process before District Court.",Q1

BOULDER COUNTY, Colo. — Residents returning to homes burned in the Marshall Fire should not sift through the ash and debris, which might contain toxic substances.

Boulder County Public Health (BCPH) issued that warning on Wednesday in regards to some organizations offering sifters designed to help homeowners recover belongings in the debris.

Ash contains small amounts of cancer-causing chemicals, and ash and debris from burned structures might contain toxic substances from synthetic and other materials, BCPH said.

""BCPH strongly recommends that residents do not attempt to remove debris or clean up properties that have been damaged or destroyed and under no circumstances should residents disturb ash regardless of what personal protective equipment (PPE) they may have,"" BCPH says in a news release.

Older buildings may contain asbestos and lead, the health department said.

The ultra-fine particles in the ash can go deep into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and damage internal organs. Even an N95 mask can allow small amounts of ash to reach your lungs.

Bill Hayes is the county's air quality coordinator. He told 9NEWS on Thursday that he understands homeowners wanting to find anything salvageable in the wreckage, but he hopes they take this warning seriously.

""At times like this, finding that one memento in the rubble can provide some solace. I get that, but it’s not worth the risk to your health,"" Hayes said. ""This level of trauma, it already puts a significant strain on you physically and mentally, and so we don’t want to add to that physical strain by exposing ourselves unnecessarily to these toxins.""

Boulder County issued the warning of toxic ash on Wednesday, days after a number of homeowners were allowed back on their property. When 9NEWS asked why the department waited so long to share the warning, they said they never saw so many relief organizations give away sifting tools before.

""Every disaster we learn something new and we’re better prepared for the next disaster,"" Hayes said. ""It’s really the first time we’ve seen a very orchestrated effort by these organizations to put the sifters in people's hands, and so we’re not going to be stopping people from going into their properties and doing that, but we are concerned when these national relief organizations come in and hand these people a sifter, it basically tells people, 'Hey, this is safe' and it's not.""

Fire professionals recommend only salvaging items that can be removed without sifting through ashes, BCPH said.

""Recovering personal and precious possessions is important and emotional to those who have lost so much due to the fires,"" the release says. ""Never compromise your safety or health in an effort to recovery belongings.""

For those whose houses in the burn area were not damaged by the fires, Boulder County offers these tips for safe cleanup:

Stay indoors or leave the burn area on windy days.

Keep doors and windows closed.

Check air filters regularly and replace them when visibly soiled for homes with central air.

Use rugs inside and outside entrances to catch any possible debris on shoes.

Avoid tracking debris into the house and remove shoes.

Wear proper PPE when cleaning ash: N95 or equivalent mask, latex or nitrile gloves, and eye protection.

Use a damp mop or cloth to clean away visible dust in the house.

Don't use harsh chemical cleaners or vinegar, as they can react with chemicals in the ash. Soap and water are adequate.

Soft surfaces and fabrics should be laundered or discarded.

Use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter system.

For exterior cleaning, spray with water. Don't sweep ash. Consider wearing an N95 or equivalent mask or respirator.",Q1
https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kevin-tober/2022/02/23/doocy-hammers-psaki-old-biden-tweets-global-warming-russia,"Doocy Hammers Psaki on Old Biden Tweets, Global Warming, Russia","Tuesday's episode of The Psaki Show featured Fox News's Peter Doocy hammering Press Secretary Jen Psaki over the Biden administration's claim that the biggest threat America is facing is climate change, as well as a pointed question by Doocy over an old Biden tweet.

Once called on, Doocy wasted no time getting to the point, asking Psaki about a hyperbolic claim by the Biden Pentagon that the ""greatest threat facing America is global warming."" He asked Psaki if that was still the administration's assessment despite the fact that we are ""facing down a potential cyberwar with Russia.""

Of course, Psaki tried running out the clock by telling Doocy that the U.S. ""is always prepared for any threat any outside entity or country poses."" Psaki then claimed that since the global warming threat comments were from the Pentagon, he would have to ask them.

Not happy with that answer, Doocy continued drilling down:

So as far as anybody watching who’s seen the coverage, it's very–at times distressing images of Russian military movements. The number one threat facing the country right now remains global warming?

There was still no answer from Psaki on whether the Biden administration thinks global warming is the biggest threat facing America. Yet moments later, Doocy brought up an old tweet from Biden in which he wrote that Vladimir Putin doesn't want him to be President:

Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be President. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with him. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) February 21, 2020

On that front, Doocy asked Psaki about the tough-talking tweets from then-candidate Biden:

But so I guess to follow up on that the President said before he got here that Putin knows if I am President of the United States, his days of tyranny and trying to intimidate the United States and those in eastern Europe are over. It's two and a half years later. He is intimidating the United States and those in Eastern Europe.

Psaki clearly took offense and claimed that she ""would hardly put it that way"" and bragged that ""Biden has rallied the world, rallied Europe to stand up against the efforts and the actions of President Putin.""

Later on in the briefing, Doocy's wife and Fox Business Network correspondent Hillary Vaughn had two questions for Psaki. The first was ""if Nord Stream 2 going online was such a threat, why in May did the President waive sanctions on the company and the chief executive behind it?""

Before letting Psaki answer both, Vaughn laid down the marker with her other question: ""Is there a concern that Nord Stream 2 if Russia were to make concessions or retreat in some way that that might open up the door to Nord Stream 2 going back online, or is it your understanding that it is dead no matter what Russia does?""

In response, Psaki said that Biden ""has never been a supporter of Nord Stream 2"" and that ""Nord Stream 2 is not moving forward"" nor has it ""been operational anyway.""

Towards the end of the briefing, Real Clear Politics' Phillip Wegmann asked a good question about sanctions that clearly caught Psaki off guard. Wegmann asked if any of the Russian oligarchs and elites being sanctioned were ""being sanctioned for the first time"" or were they simply repeat offenders. Psaki had no answer and told Wegmann that she would get back to him with a ""more specific breakdown.""

Wegmann's second question was equally intriguing when recalled that White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned that the ""Russian invasion of Ukraine would lead to U.S. Sanctions warning that would necessarily make Moscow more beholden to Beijing,"" and that if the Biden administration is ""taking any steps or issuing any warnings to keep those geopolitical foes from aligning together and marching in lockstep?""

Psaki said that China and Russia were already ""moving closer together in some capacity"" long before the current Russia/Ukraine conflict.

In the early hours of Thursday, a number of Russian activists called on social media for people to take to the streets after Putin launched an offensive on Ukraine.

Approximately 2,000 protesters gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, and up to 1,000 protesters gathered in Saint Petersburg, the former imperial capital.

Around Pushkin Square in Moscow, protesters chanted ""No to war!""

""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, said in Moscow.

""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" She said many were afraid to protest.

In Saint Petersburg, many struck a similar note.

""I have a feeling that the authorities have gone mad,"" said Svetlana Volkova, 27. The Russian protestor said that most people were unwilling to protest.

""People have been fooled by propaganda.""

As he was dragged away by three police officers, a young man shouted: ""Who are you fighting with? Arrest Putin.""

In recent years, protest laws in Russia have been toughened, and demonstrations often result in mass arrests.

Alexei Navalny, the jailed opposition leader who used to organise Russia's largest anti-Putin protests said he was against the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday.

The independent television channel Dozhd published a video in which Navalny was heard saying, ""I am against this war."".

""This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country,"" the 45-year-old said.

Russian authorities had warned anti-war sympathisers against protesting.

https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/will-other-cities-in-allegheny-county-consider-bans-on-single-use-bags/,Will Other Cities in Allegheny County Consider Bans on Single-Use Bags?,"As Pittsburgh’s citywide ban on single-use plastic bags in grocery stores and other retailers is set to go into effect this year, PennEnvironment, an environmental nonprofit, is betting there’s a countywide appetite for initiatives in other towns and boroughs.

Allegheny County Council’s Committee on Sustainability and Green Initiatives, in collaboration with PennEnvironment, is holding a public hearing at 5 p.m. Feb. 15 to hear testimony from experts about the litter in Allegheny County and how communities can enact bans on single-use plastic bags. It will be held both in person at the Allegheny County Courthouse in Conference Room 1 and online.

Pittsburgh City Council joined six communities in Pennsylvania last year when it voted unanimously to ban the use of single-use plastic bags in grocery stores and retailers. Since then, that number now includes more than a dozen communities.

Pittsburgh’s plastic bag ban, which was authored by Councilperson Erika Strassburger, will exempt bulk items such as packaged meat, fish, fruit and vegetables. Shoppers are encouraged to use reusable bags, though retailers will be allowed to sell paper bags for 10 cents each. The ban was set to go into effect a year after it’s approval — on April 12 — however, Scott McMurtry, Strassburger’s chief of staff, says there have been discussions of pushing back the enactment to a later date this year.

Dan Brown, a field organizer for PennEnvironment, says the public hearing will touch on single-use plastics as a litter problem and as a human health problem and will walk attendees through “the tangible first steps they can take to begin passing a bag ban in their municipality.”

Brown says he wants Pittsburgh’s legislative success to be a model for interested policymakers and community members who are looking to enact single-use plastic bags in their communities. The ultimate goal is a statewide ban.

“Maybe it’ll take six months,” Brown says. “Maybe it’ll even take a couple of years. But over time, we hope to kind of fill in the map in Pennsylvania. That ideally is the long game. We would love Harrisburg to take this on statewide.”

The City of Bridges has no shortage of waterways to cross, which Brown says makes Allegheny County especially vulnerable to the dangers of microplastics.

PennEnvironment conducted studies of the waterways in the county and found microplastics in even the most remote rivers. There are enough microplastics, in fact, to be the equivalent of “people eating one credit card a week,” he says.

“We’re beginning to confront kind of a sleeping giant of a problem when you look at the human health impacts of degraded plastic over the centuries, and so there’s no quick fix, but the most obvious place to start is by banning the most egregious offenders which are single-use plastic bags.”",Q1

PORT ARTHUR, Texas — A Honduran national will be spending the next eight years in federal prison after he pled guilty to a murder-for-hire plot to kill his mother-in-law and brother-in-law.

Santos Orellana-Hernandez, 47, was living in Port Arthur when he solicited the murder of two extended family members residing in Honduras.

Orellana-Hernandez reached out to Gustavo Ramires, a person located in Honduras, to kill Orellana-Hernandez’s mother-in-law, and brother-in-law, according to court documents.

Orellana-Hernandez offered to pay Ramires $200,000 in Honduran Lempira, which is valued at approximately $8,000 in US currency.

Investigators said Orellana-Hernandez wanted to get revenge on his soon-to-be ex-wife who wanted to divorce him in Jefferson County. Orellana-Hernandez reportedly told his wife that he would make her “cry tears of blood,” according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Texas.

Orellana-Hernandez told Ramires to kill the two family members on or after April 21, 2020, which was the date when the divorce was to become final.

Ramires later placed a recorded phone call to Orellana-Hernandez and the two discussed the murder-for-hire plot using code language such as “planting the corn.” Ramires told investigators that “planting the corn” meant burying victims’ bodies.

Orellana-Hernandez was indicted by a federal grand jury on May 20, 2020, and taken into custody. He conspired with his brother to intimidate his wife into making her withdraw the murder-for-hire accusation while being behind bars in early June 2020.

On November 4, 2020, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment that added the witness tampering charges.

Orellana-Hernandez pleaded guilty on July 23, 2021, to the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire, tampering with a witness by intimidation and threats, and conspiracy to commit witness tampering.

Orellana-Hernandez was sentenced to 100 months in federal prison on Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2022 by U.S. District Judge Thad Heartfield.

The Government of the Russian Federation on Monday approved a list of foreign states and territories that commit unfriendly actions against Russia, its companies, and citizens.

The list includes the United States and Canada, the EU states, the UK (including Jersey, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar), Ukraine, Montenegro, Switzerland, Albania, Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, North Macedonia, and also Japan, South Korea, Australia, Micronesia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan.

The countries and territories mentioned in the list imposed or joined the sanctions against Russia after the start of a special military operation of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine.

The government noted that according to this decree, Russian citizens and companies, the state itself, its regions and municipalities that have foreign exchange obligations to foreign creditors from the list of unfriendly countries will be able to pay them in rubles. The new temporary procedure applies to payments exceeding 10 mln rubles per month (or a similar amount in foreign currency).

Now he’s stuck in the East Valley for a month longer than he hoped.A Scottsdale City Court judge remanded the Neo-Nazi provocateur, real name Anthime Joseph Gionet, to jail Thursday afternoon for his conviction in an assault on a bouncer in December 2020.

Assistant City Prosecutor Joshua Austin asked Judge James Blake for the maximum six months in jail. Gionet’s lawyer, Zach Thornley of Goodyear, called the city’s recommendation “unprecedented.”

Blake imposed a lighter sentence of 30 days in jail and $3,200 in restitution.

It was barely a month before the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, that Gionet switched on his camera and sought to gather internet clicks in Old Town Scottsdale. He tormented workers at Giligin’s Bar and twice sprayed a bouncer, who was trying to escort him out of the business, with pepper gel during a livestream.

Pepper gel is more dangerous than pepper spray, prosecutors said at sentencing.



The worker’s eyes were bloodshot and rheumy, Scottsdale Police said.

Gionet was convicted of assault, trespass, and disorderly conduct in October – the first convictions for the 34-year-old alt-right streamer who used to work for BuzzFeed.

But Austin said Gionet has a “lack of rehabilitative potential” after he was banned from most social media websites and took to Telegram, often a haven for neo-Nazis. Gionet used the messaging service to post the prosecutor's address, email, and phone number on the site.

“The persona that’s created by the defendant may or may not be real, but he creates real dangers for our society,” Austin said in court Thursday.

And despite sounding sheepish before Blake at his sentencing, Austin shared a video with the court that was filmed after Gionet’s conviction. It suggested otherwise.

""So, even if they were like, 'You need to do a week in jail,' we're gonna say, 'Try me bitch,’” Gionet said in the video.

He also called Austin a slur for gay men in a post on Telegram.

But his mother, Suzanne Gionet, came to his defense Thursday when her testimony as a character witness contradicted most facts in her son’s case.

“I raised him to love people and be honest,” Suzanne told the court. “He wants to make an impact for good in the world, and I taught him that.”

Days after federal agents arrested Gionet, the Scottsdale court began receiving hundreds of spurious online motions filed by the public. It included such gems as endless pages of ejaculating penis emojis.

“Nearly all were spam consisting in many cases of racial epithets or similar derogatory or inflammatory comments,"" city spokesperson Kelly Corsette said.

Gionet also violated his release order and skipped court – and town – last January, according to court records.

Aaron Joseph Lester, one of his faithful fans, bailed him out for $3,000 so the then-Queen Creek resident could set up shop in Clearwater, Florida.

“I’m sick of paying for flights to Arizona,” Gionet said in a recent livestream as he prepared for his sentencing hearing.

But his first probation violation came in January 2021, when he participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, court records state.

Gionet posted video of himself marching with white supremacists at Charlottesville and hanging out with neo-Nazi blogger Andrew Anglin. He also live streamed on YouTube for 27 minutes as he committed the alleged crimes inside the U.S. Captiol. Filming his own antics is a habit.

Federal prosecutors charged him with violent entry and federal trespassing for his role in the January 6, 2021 unrest.

The next hearing for Gionet in that case is set for February 17.

Prosecutors in Gionet’s Scottsdale case referenced his involvement in the insurrection and other pending criminal charges in Maricopa County in their argument for the half-year maximum.

Last month, Maricopa County Attorney's Office claimed he defaced a Hanukkah display in front of the Arizona State Capitol and charged him with multiple counts of criminal damage. He's awaiting trial on those charges.

And in 2019, he tweeted that Jewish people should be sent to the gas chambers. The Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed him a white nationalist.

That’s why, despite Thornley criticizing the city for taking “a special interest” in Gionet’s case, Austin was adamant about imposing a strict sentence.

Six months in jail was “The only sentence that will have any chance of deterring this defendant from engaging in criminal conduct in the future,” Austin said.

Interestingly, the victim in this case told the judge Thursday he’d prefer if Gionet got off without jail time. But Blake said remanding Gionet was warranted for the “needless violence.”

And Baked Alaska’s own lawyer said, “He’s likely looking at going into federal custody.”

For now, Gionet will sit in Scottsdale City Jail. Unless he’s granted a successful appeal, which he’s promised to file, he won’t return to Clearwater until Valentine’s Day.",Q1

https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-philadelphia-da-krasner-impeachment-corman-murders,Pennsylvania Senate leader calls for impeachment of liberal Philly DA: 'We have a real crisis',"While Pennsylvania's largest city is facing a crime surge, liberal Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner is facing calls for his impeachment.

The state's Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, who's running for governor, urged state leaders on Tuesday to begin impeachment proceedings against the progressive prosecutor.

""We have a real crisis in our city, and it’s part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Those people who live in Philadelphia deserve protection. Those people who work in Philadelphia deserve protection,"" said Corman, a Republican who represents Pennsylvania's 34th District on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday.

PHILADELPHIA DA KRASNER SAYS CITY DOES NOT 'HAVE A CRISIS OF CRIME' DESPITE RECORD HOMICIDES

Corman said the violence has gotten to the point where ""you can't turn your eyes anymore.""

He said Krasner has ""created a culture of violence and death"" and action must be taken. Corman called for impeachment against Krasner because of the crime surge in Philadelphia, including 560 homicides in 2021. Corman wrote in his letter to lawmakers that only 21 percent of shootings in Philadelphia have led to criminal charges since 2015

Krasner fired back at Corman's move, according to FOX 29, calling it a political ""stunt"" and arguing he's ""inaccurately citing the article in the Pennsylvania Constitution outlining the House’s impeachment powers.""

PHILADELPHIA MAN WITH LICENSE TO CARRY SHOOTS, KILLS WOULD-BE CAR THIEF: REPORTS

Philadelphia criminal justice attorney Bill Brennan told ""Fox & Friends First"" that the impeachment measure is a ""longshot"" to succeed.

""I know there is frustration with the spike in crime in Philadelphia. It is dangerous in my city right now,"" Brennan said.

https://rejournals.com/not-just-a-national-surge-chicago-area-multifamily-market-soaring-too/,"Not just a national surge: Chicago-area multifamily market soaring, too – REJournals","Last year was a particularly unique year for the real estate industry as it pertains to the residential trends and migration patterns left in the pandemic’s wake. With a majority of the corporate real estate sector opting to implement work-from-home or work-from-anywhere models in order to retain staff and reduce overhead, there was a significant surge throughout the country in workers relocating to more suburban areas.

This occurred for a variety of reasons, such as individuals seizing the opportunity to live farther away from their offices and others realizing the potential financial savings and change of scenery that suburban living can provide. From a health and wellness perspective, moving to areas with smaller populations appeared as a practical solution in terms of lowering the risk of virus transmissions as well as a way to reduce the sources of stress that often accompany urban life, such as noise pollution and smaller living spaces.

With the worst of the pandemic appearing to be behind us, these migration trends are beginning to shift once again. However, instead of an outright reversal of the exodus seen in 2020, the population has found a middle ground. Urban areas are seeing a surge in new residents while the suburbs continue to thrive. New York City, as an example, is seeing almost twice as many new residents compared to 2019 figures while Chicago’s urban market continues to be outpaced by the suburbs. The city of Chicago itself, however, continues to retain its title as the third most populous city in the United States despite 2020’s notable outbound migration.

Chicago in focus

The unique migration patterns in and out of the Chicago metropolitan area, have resulted in an incredibly diverse multifamily market landscape. The demand in this area mirrors the broader multifamily trends being seen throughout the entire country, with some residents continuing to demonstrate a heightened interest in the suburbs while others begin returning to the inner city.

This dichotomy is likely attributable in part to the vaccine and booster shots now being more widespread and available as well as businesses beginning to bring workers back into the office. Certain companies opting to continue using their WFA models or adopt hybrid strategies, however, present one possible explanation as to why the post-pandemic world is not simply snapping back to its 2019 landscape.

My firm Pensam has been consistently exercising its team’s market insights to meet this spectrum of demand. Over the past year, the firm has acquired four multifamily properties in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs as well as preferred equities and other transactions throughout Illinois and the rest of the country. This focus on the Chicago MSA is not by chance, as the area’s multifamily market activity over the past year has shown a clear interest in both urban areas and their surrounding suburbs. This interest has paved the way for firms like Pensam to execute deals inside of a particularly diverse pool.

Transactions across the spectrum

1900 at Canterfield, a 260-unit stabilized multifamily community in West Dundee, Illinois, acquired by Pensam in the summer of 2021, provides an example of the types of suburban properties that saw a surge in interest following the pandemic. 1900 at Canterfield contains 18 buildings across 23.6 acres, providing the suburban atmosphere, low density and spacious design that city emigrants are seeking, but is located less than a mile from I-90, granting easy access to the Schaumburg job market.

The building’s amenities also include a clubhouse, outdoor lounge area and swimming pool–amenities that today’s suburban residents are expecting to accompany the increased space available.

More recently, Pensam also acquired Lakeside Apartments in Wheaton and Aspen Place in Aurora, both Chicago suburbs. These two properties, containing 204 and 416 units respectively, demonstrate not only a high level of interest in the Chicago MSA, but an interest that is continuing to grow. Combined with the firm’s latest acquisition, the 336-unit Butterfield Oaks in Aurora, Illinois, evidence points to this momentum carrying forward.

A promising 2022

Pensam’s strong focus on Chicago and its surrounding suburbs indicate that the firm is placing great confidence in the real estate industry’s continuing rebound from the pandemic, poising itself to keep both the urban and suburban multifamily markets in focus throughout 2022.

Against the backdrop of Pensam’s performance in the national multifamily market throughout last year, this is further evidence that the worst of the pandemic’s effects on the U.S. multifamily market are likely behind us. Going forward, all signs point to this sector continuing to improve in 2022 and lead the country to pre-pandemic levels of activity and beyond.

https://www.today.com/parents/teens/banned-book-clubs-rcna13965,How some students are fighting back against book bans in their schools,"As more school districts across the country vote to ban books, students are taking matters into their own hands.

Joslyn Diffenbaugh, 14, an eighth grader at Kutztown Middle School in Pennsylvania, has always been an avid reader. Prior to the 2021-2022 school year, she told her mom she wanted to start a book club — just another excuse to haul her latest read around and discuss it with her peers.

Then she started hearing about books being banned in various states, and watched as her parents started receiving mailers from candidates running for the local school board calling for books to be banned in her school district, too. Her plans shifted, and the Banned Book Club was born.

""It's frustrating because a lot of the adults are saying, 'Well, you can't read this,' but yet they've never asked any teenagers how we feel about these topics."" Joslyn Diffenbaugh, 14

""I have a really big love for books,"" Joslyn tells TODAY Parents. ""And I really just want to let people have access to all these books and really see why they are trying to ban them.""

About 15 students attend the book club — the youngest member is in seventh grade and the oldest is a junior in high school. Around 300 students attend Kutztown middle school, and nearly 440 attend the high school.

“We’re focusing on the newer banned books, especially books dealing with race and LGBTQ+ issues,” Joslyn says. “But we’re also reading historically banned books, because we want to see why books have been banned in the past compared to why these books are now being banned today.”

Related: School district bans ""The Bluest Eye""

While there has been increased pressure to ban books by parents and specific board members in the district — including the book “I Am Jazz,” based on the real life of author Jazz Jennings, and “Gender Queer: A Memoir,” by Maia Kobabe — on Jan. 18, the Kutztown School Board voted 5-4 to keep the challenged books in circulation at the district’s high school.

Additional book-related measures also failed, including one to ""require a parental signature to check out the book and another to censor specific pages of the book containing graphic illustrations,” according to original reporting by Reading Eagle.

Joslyn says the book club recently finished ""Animal Farm"" by George Orwell, and are beginning to start ""The Hate U Give"" by Angie Thomas. After its release in 2017, ""The Hate U Give"" was the American Library Association’s eighth most banned book.

“‘The Hate U Give’ is really inspiring me to read more,” Bridget Johnson, 13, who attends the book club, tells TODAY. (All the children featured in this story spoke to TODAY with their parents' permission.) Bridget says she wasn’t really into reading for fun before attending the club, but now loves to learn about symbolism and enjoys the conversations the club inspires.

""I don't like that students are trying to be controlled like this,"" she says. ""Especially if the book isn't actually harmful to anyone. It's pointless.""

""It's frustrating because a lot of the adults are saying, 'Well, you can't read this,' but yet they've never asked any teenagers how we feel about these topics,"" Joslyn adds. ""They're telling us how to feel, not asking us.""

Younger students are taking action, too

In Missouri, the Wentzville School Board voted 4-3 to ban the “The Bluest Eye,” by Toni Morrison, prompting 7-year-old Peighton Gallagher to send her school board a letter, with the help of her mom.

""She loves to read,"" Peighton's mom, Rebecca Gallagher, tells TODAY. ""So when she overheard my mother and I talking about what was going on, and that a book was being removed, she decided that she was going to write the school board because she knew that I had done the same. I email quite frequently.""

Gallagher says she didn't tell Peighton specifically why the book was banned — just that ""there were some topics that made people uncomfortable, and so some parents didn’t want their children reading those topics.""

""I helped her, of course,"" she adds. ""But she wrote in there that she didn't feel books should be removed in the library. That if there were things that parents didn't want their children to read, that they could request that their child not read the book.""

Several administrative staff members wrote back to Peighton, thanking her for taking the time to send in her thoughts and applauding her for self-advocacy at such a young age.

""I'm so grateful that you shared your thoughts and ideas,"" one school board member wrote back. ""That's quite impressive for a 2nd grader!""

The board voted to ban “The Bluest Eye” against the recommendation of a review committee tasked with considering requests to ban or censor books. The committee, made up of parents, teachers, librarians, and one board member who voted in favor of pulling the book, recommended the book be retained.

The district also removed “All Boys Aren’t Blue” by George M. Johnson, “Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic” by Alison Bechdel, and “Heavy: An American Memoir,"" by Kiese Laymon from school library shelves, and without the review board's consideration.

Gallagher says that while she is proud of her daughter and the other students who are taking action, she wishes they didn't feel obligated to take a stand.

""I actually attended the school board meeting where this was discussed,"" Gallagher said. ""And we actually had a small group of high school students present... you could tell they are upset about the book being removed. They shouldn't have to be experiencing this.""

Parents respond to student-led efforts

John Kaelin, a parent in the Wentzville school district and father of two, says he’s running for the school board in this year’s upcoming election.

“Our children deserve board leadership that they can look up to,” Kaelin tells TODAY. “And so we as parents have to model that behavior. The ability to think critically and to separate information from misinformation. If our board isn’t going to do that, how can we ask our students to be taught to do that in schools?”

While Kaelin’s children, ages 8 and 11, have not been affected by the recent wave of banned books, he says he wants to ensure they won’t be in the future.

“We need to lead today so they learn how to lead tomorrow,” Kaelin said. “The kids who are starting these banned books clubs and who are advocating for themselves have those parents who have modeled that. And that does give me hope.”

Heather Fleming, a mom of three living in Missouri and founder of two non-profit community organizations that work on education equity, is helping to get recently banned books in the hands of students who want to read them.

“On Friday, we connected with another Black-owned bookstore here in St. Louis called Eye See Me,” Fleming tells TODAY. “We created this program to make sure that we can send a book to anyone who requests one.”

As of Sunday morning, the Banned Book program received over $12,500 in donations and over 500 requests for books.

Fleming says she has received personal attacks, harassment, and threats, while Rebecca Gallagher says there are parents in her school district who try to intimidate students who oppose books being banned, going so far as intimidating them online.

“In our district, the group of parents that is challenging these books are also taking photos of these kids in these meetings and mocking them online,” Gallagher explains. “It’s so inappropriate. But the students stand firm in what they believe.”

Students say they'll continue to speak up

Bridget, one of the Kutztown banned book club attendees, says she'll continue to speak up, not just for herself but for her peers.

""Just hearing about (books being banned) is making kids feel unsafe in their school,"" she says. ""Like they can't talk to people in the school, or that they just can't be openly... anything.""

Joslyn agrees, and believes that more books are going to be banned in the future — another reason why it's important to her that the book club continue to read and meet.

""It's scary seeing all these books being banned, especially for people they may be representing,"" she says. ""It's also a lot of history that is being banned or censored, too. And history is one of the best ways to learn and to make sure that you can make better decisions in the future.""

Jennifer Lau, a Kutztown alumni and mom of two, ages 9 and 11, says as a LGBTQ+ parent she fears what both students and parents of the LGBTQ+ community are hearing when books centering their experiences are banned.

""It's been very hard for us to see these bans coming into place, especially coming into books that are around LGBT issues,"" Lau tells TODAY. ""We've just felt very uncomfortable and that we need to closet ourselves more and not be as open in our community.""

Both Joslyn and Bridget say many of their LGBTQ+ peers and friends are also afraid, especially those who have not yet come out to their parents, family members and peers. Lau says she can sympathize.

""That was one of the reasons why I moved away,"" she says. ""I didn't live here for a very long time and just came back about eight years ago. I thought that maybe things had changed... but now it's very disappointing and saddening to me that it has not changed at all.""

Now she says she worries that her family will have to move, or that they'll have to pull her two children from the public school system in order to protect them.

""There was a letter that was sent to our home, along with a lot of other parents in our district, that was targeting the book 'I am Jazz,'"" she explains. ""My older son did read the letter, and it was very upsetting.""

Both Joslyn and Bridget remain hopeful that their efforts — as well as the efforts and support of other students, parents, teachers, and administrators — will change things for the better.

""Our generation is very accepting of people of different races and who identify differently,"" Joslyn says.

""I'm hopeful for the future, for sure,"" adds Bridget. ""This generation — we're growing so much. Things aren't better yet, but clubs like these are starting.""",Q1
https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-nashville-tennessee-executions-16121452c3e717e113e361bc614af5f6,DA: Intellectual disability should prevent inmate execution,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Nashville’s lead prosecutor says he agrees with defense attorneys that a death row inmate is intellectually disabled and should not face execution.

District Attorney Glenn Funk made the assessment in a filing this week that determines Byron Black should instead face a sentence of life in prison. The inmate’s attorneys are arguing the 65-year-old should be spared under a 2021 law that made Tennessee’s prohibition against executing people with intellectual disability retroactive. Previously, Tennessee had no mechanism for an inmate to reopen a case to press an intellectual disability claim.

Black is currently scheduled to be executed on Aug. 18. The district attorney’s statements came in a filing responding to a motion by Black’s attorneys, who are asking a judge to determine that the inmate has an intellectual disability that prohibits his execution.

Now the judge has to review the filings and decide whether to set aside the death verdict and resentence Black.

The district attorney’s filing says there is a different standard in place now than in 2004, when the court found that Black didn’t meet the now-obsolete definition of “mental retardation.”

Psychologist Susan Redmond Vaught, who was one of the state’s experts in the 2004 determination, has now concluded that Black meets the new law’s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability. Another expert made the determination as well.

“In light of the 2021 changes” to state law, “as well as newly available documentation, changes in the standards of care, and changes in diagnostic criteria — Dr. Vaught has recently reconsidered her opinion on the question of Petitioner’s intellectual disability,” the district attorney wrote.

Black was convicted in Davidson County of murdering his girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her daughters Latoya, 9, and Lakesha, 6, at their home in April 1988. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three. At the time of the killings, Black was on work release while serving time for shooting and wounding Clay’s estranged husband.

The district attorney wrote that he met with the victims’ family, explained the new law and discussed the reports by experts, but those family members told him they still want Black to be executed.

Black would be the second inmate to have a death sentence tossed due to intellectual disability under the new state law.

Pervis Payne, 54, successfully showed the court in Shelby County that he was intellectually disabled. He was resentenced in January and will be eligible for parole in about five years.

Tennessee has five executions scheduled for 2022, including Black’s. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the state has not put any inmates to death since February 2020, when Nicholas Sutton died in the electric chair. Black’s execution had been set for October 2020, but the pandemic saw it rescheduled twice.

During the pandemic pause, another inmate was removed from death row.

Two years. We’ve been at war for two years. With a virus that’s taken a terrible and uneven toll, and with each other — as Americans, as ideological tribes, as the privileged and the precarious, as those forced to cross borders and those who build citadels of exclusion. The pandemic has altered the social lives of everyone on the planet — as well as our inner lives.

In an unanimous vote, the seven-member Jefferson County school board approved a $7.2 million district proposal meant to bolster school security while addressing root causes of community violence.

""I think it is something that will keep our buildings safe and something that will not contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline,"" board vice chairman Corrie Shull said.

Interested in education? Sign up for The Hall Pass, our education newsletter

But board members stressed Louisville, not just JCPS, has to do more to deal with the violence trickling into its schools.

""That gun is not coming from a place where they are looking to harm,"" said board member Joe Marshall, discussing weapons found in schools. ""Many of our students live in places they don't feel safe.

""I will say again, that the hope is that all of our city's institutions will partner with this board, with this superintendent and with our staff to really meet the needs of students in order to curb the issues of violence in our community,"" Marshall continued.

For years, some Black students and parents, along with their allies, pushed the district to keep police out of schools. But now, facing pressure from state lawmakers, JCPS will have its own team of armed officers.

As part of the plan, JCPS will expand its existing district security team to include 30 ""school safety officers."" Like members of the current security team, they will have arrest powers, but unlike the current team, they will carry guns.

Between a mix of staffing concerns and fears of worsening racial disparities in court involvement and discipline, the officers will not be stationed inside schools and will report to district leaders — not an outside police agency.

Most officers will be assigned to clusters of schools to respond in emergencies, but will not be stationed inside buildings. Three alternative schools — Breckinridge Metro, Minor Daniels Academy and Waller-Williams — will have dedicated officers.

Board member Linda Duncan felt the proposal didn't go far enough, partially because officers would be stationed outside schools.

""More of the officers need to be steps away from violence, not blocks away,"" Duncan said.

Inside schools, JCPS will hire safety administrators to monitor potential threats at all middle and high schools.

Schools with both middle and high school grades will get two administrators, as will the schools with the highest needs. Each assistant superintendent for elementary schools will get two safety administrators, too.

Background: JCPS school security debate often focuses on police in schools, but are there other ways?

Both positions will be trained in topics including drug rehabilitation, suicide prevention, implicit bias and de-escalation tactics.

Neither role is meant to be involved in school discipline.

Thursday's vote comes after more than two years of debate over the role of police in Jefferson County Public Schools, particularly over racially disproportionate policing of students of color. A majority of JCPS students identify as a racial minority.

JCPS has not had school resource officers (which tend to report to outside police agencies rather than district or school leaders) since 2019, when Louisville police pulled a majority of the 28 SROs out of schools due to budget cuts. The school board later axed the remaining contracts for officers.

District officials began crafting plans for an in-house security team, but a proposal never came to a vote as schools shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Protests against police brutality in the wake of the death of Breonna Taylor, a JCPS graduate, at the hands of Louisville police then prompted districts to revisit their ties to police.

Security talks continued to be tabled largely until 16-year-old student Tyree Smith was shot and killed waiting for the school bus in September. Hours after his death, LMPD Chief Erika Shields called on the district to put police in schools.

District officials believe their plan will satisfy a state law requiring an officer to be ""assigned"" to each campus, although some Republican lawmakers said it will fall short of the law since each school would not have a dedicated officer.

Legislation that would require police at each school by August, regardless of funding or staffing concerns, has struggled to get an initial vote in Frankfort.

Rep. Kevin Bratcher, a Louisville Republican sponsoring the legislation, said the bill ""needs tweaks."" Rep. Regina Huff, the chairwoman of the House Education Committee, signaled one issue is a lack of manpower to put an officer in every Kentucky school.

Rep. Liz Cheney, who co-chair’s the Jan. 6 Select Witch Hunt Committee, says they are considering recommending enhanced criminal charges for Trump’s “supreme dereliction of duty.”

Cheney is looking at his delay in telling the rioters to stop as the ‘supreme dereliction’. The rioters wouldn’t have stopped in any case.

THE REPORT WILL BE A “NARRATIVE THRILLER”

Of course, “No National Guard” Pelosi isn’t being examined at all and is allowed to hide her correspondence from that day as the Trump haters on the committee come up with a “story” — a “narrative thriller” as Politico puts it. They were quoting anonymous sources familiar with the process.

The committee actually wants to tell a dramatic story so Americans understand and agree with them. They don’t want a typical report.

The Washington Post reports that the “House Jan. 6 committee is looking for high-profile journalists to write its report about the attack on the Capitol. They’re “hoping to build a narrative thriller that compels audiences and is a departure from government reports of yore.”

This entire process is to keep Donald Trump from running, banish conservative candidates and dehumanize Trump supporters. It’s a big job requiring “enhancements” for drama’s sake.

By the way, where was Speaker Pelosi during the riot? She’s responsible for security at the Capitol.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Facebook that an unspecified number of peacekeepers would go to Kazakhstan for a limited period to stabilize the situation after state buildings were torched and the Almaty international airport was seized.

Eight police and national guard troops were killed in the unrest on Tuesday and Wednesday, Russia’s state-owned Sputnik agency quoted the Kazakh interior ministry as saying on Wednesday. Russian news agencies, quoting Kazakh media, later said two soldiers had also been killed in what they described as an anti-terrorist operation at Almaty airport.

Initially sparked by anger at a fuel price rise, the protests have quickly spread to take in wider opposition to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who retained significant power despite quitting in 2019 after a nearly three-decade rule.

Nazarbayev, 81, has been widely seen as the main political force in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital which bears his name. His family is believed to control much of the economy, the largest in Central Asia. He has not been seen or heard from since the protests began.

The Central Asian nation’s reputation for stability under Nazarbayev helped attract hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign investment in its oil and metals industries.

But a younger generation is demanding the liberalization seen in other former satellite states of the Soviet Union. The protests are the worst in Kazakhstan – a country five times the size of France with a population of nearly 19 million people – in over a decade.

Apparently seeking to appease public ire, Tokayev sacked Nazarbayev as head of the powerful Security Council on Wednesday, and took it over himself. He also appointed a new head of the State Security Committee, successor to the Soviet-era KGB, and removed Nazarbayev’s nephew from the No. 2 position on the committee.

Tokayev’s Cabinet also resigned.

But protests continued, with demonstrators taking control of the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s biggest city, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Flights were cancelled.

Interfax quoted an official as saying the airport had subsequently been cleared of protesters. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the report.

Earlier, riot police used teargas and flash grenades against protesters in Almaty but then appeared to withdraw.

A second Tokayev TV appearance

In the early hours of Thursday, in his second televised speech within hours, Tokayev said that he had appealed for help to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a military alliance of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.

He said foreign-trained “terrorist” gangs were seizing buildings, infrastructure and weapons, and had taken five aircraft, including foreign ones, at Almaty airport.

“It is an undermining of the integrity of the state and most importantly it is an attack on our citizens who are asking me… to help them urgently,” Tokayev said.

“Almaty was attacked, destroyed, vandalized, the residents of Almaty became victims of attacks by terrorists, bandits. Therefore it is our duty… to take all possible actions to protect our state.”

Russian news agencies quoted Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, as saying security had been strengthened around key installations at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which Russia uses for space launches.

‘Complete anarchy’

A resident of Almaty who mingled with the protesters on Wednesday said most of those he met appeared to come from the city’s impoverished outskirts or nearby villages.

At the main square, vodka was being distributed and some people were discussing whether to head towards the city bazaar or a wealthy area for possible looting, the resident said.

https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/west/2022/03/03/309000.htm,Woman Gets 5-Year Term for Police Car Fires in 2020 Protest,"SEATTLE (AP) — A woman who torched five Seattle police cars during a tumultuous protest that heralded a summer of unrest after George Floyd’s murder in 2020 was sentenced Tuesday to five years in prison.

Margaret Channon, 26, of Tacoma, used an aerosol can and a lighter as a makeshift flame-thrower to burn the unoccupied, parked police vehicles in downtown Seattle on May 30, soon after officers sprayed tear gas to disperse a massive crowd. For 25 minutes she ran back and forth between the cars, adding fire as necessary to destroy them.

The burning police cars became some of the most indelible images of Seattle’s unrest — overshadowing the thousands who demonstrated for racial justice with justifiable anger, but who were nevertheless peaceful, Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Greenberg told U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour.

“She wasn’t alone, but Ms. Channon set the tone for what that protest became moving forward,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Greenberg said. “Ms. Channon left downtown Seattle in flames and in billowing smoke.”

Millions across the country took to the streets after cellphone video surfaced of white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee against the neck of Floyd, who was Black, for 9 1/2 minutes as Floyd pleaded for breath. Chauvin was convicted last year on state charges of murder and manslaughter and was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison; he and three other officers have been convicted of federal civil rights violations.

In cities across the United States, protesters fed up with seeing Black people killed by police faced off against heavily-armed officers, with some smashing cruisers, ransacking businesses and setting fires. In Seattle, demonstrators went on to seize an area of several city blocks in the Capitol Hill neighborhood — the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest — and police for a time abandoned the nearby East Precinct building.

Verisk’s Property Claim Services estimated that the civil unrest that spread to more than 20 cities caused an unprecedented $2 billion in insured property losses. That surpassed the destruction caused by rioting in the Los Angeles area after the videotaped police beating of motorist Rodney King in 1994, which led to an estimated $1.4 billion in insured losses, measured in 2020 dollars.

Channon, who also acknowledged smashing a store window and busting the cash register at a sandwich shop, was the fifth and final defendant sentenced in federal court for actions related to the civil unrest in Seattle.

Kelly Jackson received more than three years for throwing Molotov cocktails at two Seattle police vehicles on May 30. Tyre Means got five years for burning one Seattle police vehicle and stealing a firearm out of another that day. Desmond David-Pitts and Isaiah Willoughby received 20 and 24 months, respectively, for setting fires at the East Precinct.

Channon apologized in a letter to the court and through a sentencing memo filed by her lawyer, acknowledging that the Black Lives Matter movement does not condone illegal acts and that as a white woman it was not her place to coopt the cause.

“I apologize to the many workers and activists — who have given decades of their lives to building a countermeasure to police violence — that did not want to see fire,” Channon wrote. “I had intended to effect positive change, but my attempt was misguided.”

Her mother, Elizabeth MacGahan, wrote her own letter to the court, saying Channon grew up in a family with a long history of civil service and citing the destabilizing effects of the pandemic, the protests and the recent deaths of her two beloved grandmothers as possible factors in her actions.

“It’s a very difficult time to be young and sensitive, and to suffer losses,” she said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office said it offered Channon a chance to plead guilty to conspiracy, rather than arson — which would have enabled her to argue for a sentence less than than the five-year mandatory minimum for arson.

Channon refused. Her attorney, Vanessa Pai-Thompson, wrote that “Channon was adamant that she would not do anything to shift blame to others for decisions that were hers alone.”

After the sentencing, Seattle U.S. Attorney Nick Brown — the first Black person to serve as the Justice Department’s top prosecutor in western Washington — said he understood and shared the anger over Floyd’s murder.

“I watched people gather and protest here in Seattle with a lot of admiration,” Brown said. “To see that devolve into bombing of police vehicles and destruction of businesses … was profoundly sad for me.”

His nearly 80-year-old father, Hank, was jailed during civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s, and Brown said he appreciated that protests sometimes must be loud, angry and disruptive — but not destructive. Channon’s actions undercut the message of the Black Lives Matter movement, he said.

Haley and a friend were driving to Pennsylvania when they got into an accident that left their car blocking the middle of the road.

""She walked behind the car and that was when another car came and hit their car,"" said her mother Brook Stealey. ""Haley was trapped under the gentleman’s car that hit them. She never did regain consciousness from the accident.""

Haley died days later devastating her family and friends.

""If you're against the Anti-Grooming Bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don't denounce the grooming of 4-8 year-old children. Silence is complicity. This is how it works, Democrats, and I didn't make the rules,"" Pushaw wrote in a follow-up tweet.

Her use of the phrase ""silence is complicity"" appears to be ironic. Pushaw has trolled Democrats with the similar phrase ""silence is violence"" on numerous occasions.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Correction: An earlier version of this story said JSO SWAT conducted the raid. The raid was conducted by a team of JSO detectives and officers.

Worship services were interrupted by a police raid Wednesday night at the Jacksonville Assembly of the Body of Christ on Old Kings Road.

The raid was the result of a long-term investigation that started with a tip regarding possible sexual abuse in 2020. The investigation uncovered sexual and physical abuse of minors in the church that spanned over a period of over thirty years, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

Pastor Paul Dyal was jailed on charges of capital sexual battery on a child under 12.

Two other men associated with the church, Vernon Williamson and Jerome Teschendorf, were arrested in Oklahoma, both on charges of capital sexual battery.

Court records show Teschendorf was previously arrested in 1985 Jacksonville for “Sexual Battery – victim mentally defective” but the records do not show how the case was resolved.

Dyal made his first court appearance on Thursday afternoon.

Sources tell First Coast News that there are multiple alleged victims who say they were abused by one or all three of the men as children in incidents dating back to the 1980s.

One woman, who is 50 now, claims she was abused from the ages of five to 14. Another woman alleges she was seven when she was sexually battered.

JSO officials spoke with numerous victims and witnesses over the course of the investigation. Because of these interviews, investigators have reason to believe there are additional people involved in the physical and sexual abuse.

Police also believe there might be additional victims and witnesses and are actively seeking to speak with them.

In September 2020, the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office Special Assault Unit received a tip regarding possible sexual abuse... Posted by Jacksonville Sheriff's Office on Thursday, March 10, 2022

A Jacksonville resident whose family members belong to the church spoke anonymously to First Coast News following the raid.

“After the abuse that has been happening at this ‘church’ for years, it is time the victims are able to get the justice they deserve,” she said.

The church’s website has been disabled but, according to information gleaned from the Wayback Machine at https://archive.org/web, this is the pastor’s bio:

“Paul B. Dyal resides in Jacksonville, Florida with his wife of fifty years, Catherine. He is the founder and Sr. pastor of The Jacksonville Assembly of The Body of Christ church. Pastor Dyal and his wife are the parents of two sons, three grandsons, and one granddaughter. He has traveled and spoken as a minister and bible teacher in forty eight of the United States as well as twenty other countries. He writes a blog, (paulbdyal.blogspot.com) where he has shared his beliefs in over eleven hundred postings. He still travels extensively teaching and preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.”

In the video, which is available on YouTube, but cannot be embedded — and WTOP warns you that it is graphic — police officers in Montgomery County pull over a white Mercedes at the intersection of Wayne Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue, allegedly because it matched the description they had from an off-duty officer for a vehicle and suspect wanted in a 4:15 a.m. shooting of a man in the 900 block of Bonifant Street.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/covid-school-closures-failed-women-children-rachel-oleary-carmona,COVID school closures failed women and children and leaders on both sides must step up,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit women hard. At Women’s March, where I serve as executive director, we know this firsthand. We feel it in our own lives. We see and hear it from our millions of members in all 50 states.

Women in America are not all right. And the politicians tasked with making our lives better, on both sides of the aisle, all too often only make things worse – ignoring us, lying to us, or speaking for us instead of simply helping.

Our organization has talked at length about the ways Republican officials have hurt women recently: rejecting paid family and medical leave, blocking minimum wage increases, and quashing access to reproductive health care, to name just a few. (Not to mention the undermining-trust-in-our-vaccines and attempting-to-overturn-our-elections things…) We’ll keep talking, writing, marching and even running for office until we get the change we need.

WHY A LAWSUIT OVER FORCED MASKING OF OUR CHILDREN IN VIRGINIA IS NECESSARY

But at Women’s March, our fight isn’t red versus blue. It’s a fight for the 51% of our population being left behind by leaders who lack political courage and refuse to do their jobs. And here, Democrats are guilty, too.

In some instances, they haven’t fought hard enough to keep their promises. In other instances, though, Democrats have fought too hard (and for too long) for the wrong things – and women have suffered the consequences.

School closures are one example.

When the pandemic first hit, we literally didn’t know better. After all, children and young adults were among the hardest hit during the last pandemic, the 1918 Spanish Flu. When we didn’t know if COVID-19 would act similarly, closing schools made sense. It was the right decision.

But just a few months in, we knew this wasn’t the case. By June 2020, the American Academy of Pediatrics was already advocating for a return to safe, in-person school , noting that the benefits for kids – academic, physical and mental – outweighed the risks. And that was before vaccines were even developed, much less widely and freely available. Still, many Democratic cities and states kept schools closed for another year. And during more recent COVID spikes, too many have been too quick to shut them down again.

From mental health to math scores to simply eating a good meal, school closures failed the kids they were supposed to protect.

This isn’t to discount staffing shortages, especially this January, that left some schools with no choice other than to temporarily close doors. And it isn’t to blame teachers, who are mostly women, who’ve done God’s work during the pandemic, and whose concerns for themselves and their students are real.

Still, the impact on children – particularly the most disadvantaged – has been devastating. From mental health to math scores to simply eating a good meal, school closures failed the kids they were supposed to protect. It’s true that Black and Latino parents were most hesitant to send their children back to school, for very real current and historic reasons. But every family should have had a choice – and every school should have been given necessary resources to open safely. (What actually happened: schools in communities hit hardest by COVID often had the fewest resources to combat it.)

No wonder moms exited – or, really, were ejected from – the workforce in droves over the past two years. In September 2020 and 2021, a combined 1,172,000 women left their jobs. It’s no coincidence these mass-career-casualties coincided with the start of school years, when virtual learning was either status quo or used regularly as a backup.

Then there are the women who could never afford to stop working – especially outside the home. For millions who couldn’t go remote, especially the essential workers we hailed as heroes, school closures didn’t mean worrying about kids wandering into the background of Zoom meetings. They meant leaving a 6-year-old home alone, hoping she wouldn’t burn the apartment down trying to make herself grilled cheese for lunch. Or they meant bringing that 6-year-old to work so she could access Wi-Fi from Taco Bell’s parking lot.

Today, it’s clear as daylight. While closing schools isn’t always a mistake, the politicians who promoted and perpetuated school closures, especially recently, were by and large mistaken. Fortunately, with the omicron surge subsiding, most kids are back in classrooms. And many women – though not all – are back at work.

So why bring this up now? Why not just move on?

Because Women’s March doesn’t pledge allegiance to any political party or its elites – even one that claims to fight for working families and communities of color. Our allegiance is to women. And women, especially from working families and communities of color, have suffered the brunt of the past two years and the school closures they’ve normalized.

It’s important to say so – loudly and clearly. After all, if we’re not honest when leaders harm us, if we don’t have the courage to tell them they’re wrong, we’re all but asking them to do it again.

A Chicago-based Catholic nonprofit has been awarded more than $3.6 million to assist the launch of a national network of independent institutes of Catholic thought, to promote dialogue about the relationship of faith and science.

“The In Lumine Network sets a place at the table of the secular academy for the Catholic intellectual tradition,” said Michael Le Chevallier, acting executive director of the Lumen Christi Institute, in a statement announcing the $3,648,000 grant from the John Templeton Foundation.

“It will help established and nascent institutes for Catholic thought to scale up, deepen their engagement around faith and reason, share ideas, build on the successes of others, and amplify impact,” he said.

Several institutes for Catholic thought already operate on campuses across the United States, but this project by the Lumen Christi Institute is the first to gather them in a consortium.

The project is called “In Lumine: Supporting the Catholic Intellectual Tradition on Campuses Nationwide.” It will help institutes of Catholic thought collaborate and refine on-campus offerings, particularly addressing the relationship between faith and science.

The project will also include eight summer seminars for students across the nation.

The project will initially comprise six members: the Lumen Christi Institute at the University of Chicago; the Nova Forum at the University of Southern California; the Collegium Institute at the University of Pennsylvania; the Saint Anselm Institute at the University of Virginia; COLLIS at Cornell University; and the Harvard Catholic Forum at Harvard University.

Nova Forum Director David Albertson said the grant will open new dialogue at USC between faith and science, including medicine and engineering.

The program director for the Harvard Catholic Forum voiced similar hopes, saying the grant would allow the Forum to “enter with confidence into a new phase of growth, expanding our impact on present and future leaders in science, scholarship and the professions.”

NEW YORK — A Nassau County Supreme Court judge has ruled that Gov. Kathy Hochul's student mask mandate is unconstitutional — but Hochul said she plans to fight the decision.

According to the Jan. 24 decision by Judge Thomas Rademaker, the law was ""promulgated and enacted unlawfully by an executive branch state agency and therefore void and unenforceable as a matter of law."" Several Long Island districts sent out letters Monday night saying that masks are optional on Tuesday, including Sachem, East Islip and Plainedge.

The decision also said that it does not ""opine on the efficacy, need or requirement of masks as a means or tool in dealing with the COVID-19 virus."" The issue is only whether the rule was properly enacted, the decision said. Also, the issue at hand is not a challenge to any executive order issued by Hochul, the decision said, but is a challenge to a ""rule"" enacted by New York State Commissioner of Health Dr. Mary Bassett and enforced by Hochul.

Ronald Masera, superintendent of the Center Moriches School District, tweeted a copy of the appeal that he said keeps the mask mandate in all New York State schools in place This appeal keeps mask mandate in all NYS schools in place https://t.co/7sPBBa6rw2

— Dr. Masera (@CMSchools_Super) January 25, 2022 The decision came after new Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman signed a trio of executive orders allowing school districts to end the mask mandates if they chose to do so.

""A judge declared that Gov. Hochul's mask mandate is unconstitutional, deeming mandates invalid statewide,"" Blakeman wrote on Facebook Monday, calling the decision ""a huge win."" He added: ""If you want to wear a mask, we support you. If you don't, it's your constitutional right."" Hochul also spoke out. ""My responsibility as governor is to protect New Yorkers throughout this public health crisis, and these measures help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. We strongly disagree with this ruling, and we are pursuing every option to reverse this immediately.""

Rep. Lee Zeldin (R- Shirley) weighed in as well on Twitter. ""NY Supreme Court has just struck down Hochul admin's statewide mask mandate,"" said Zeldin, who is running for governor. ""Honored to have fought with small biz owners, parents, elected like @NassauExec & many more for common sense, freedom & science.""

The State Education Department sent a letter to school superintendents statewide, stating that ""schools must continue to follow the mask rule,"" according to a PIX 11 report. “It is SED’s understanding that the Department of Health will appeal the Nassau County Supreme Court decision, which will result in an automatic stay that will unambiguously restore the mask rule until such time as an appellate court issues a further ruling. Therefore, schools must continue to follow the mask rule,"" the post said. Although the number of new positive cases on Long Island was down 75 percent this week, Hochul continued to urge parents to vaccinate their children, especially those in the 5-11 age group.",Q1

SHOREWOOD, IL — More than five months after Shorewood police investigated a deadly shooting in the parking lot for the new La Quinta Inn & Suites, Shorewood police fatally shot a man in the same parking lot, during a late night standoff.

During Tuesday's 3:30 a.m. phone interview, Shorewood Police Chief Phil Arnold told Joliet Patch that the man who died had fired his gun at one of the officers responding to the 911 call at the La Quinta. Tuesday morning, the Will County Coroner's Office identified the man as Jose DeJesus-Hernandez, 39, of Oswego. ""Based on everything at this point in time, it appears to be justified,"" Arnold said of his Shorewood police officer's use of deadly force.

Shortly after 11:30 p.m. Monday, Shorewood police raced to the La Quinta Inn, 19747 NE Frontage Road, for a call involving a man requesting an ambulance in the rear of the parking lot. The officers found the man, later identified as DeJesus-Hernandez, in a car in the back of the parking lot. When the officers approached, he pulled out a gun, Arnold said. Shorewood's police chief said his officers took up a place of safety and tried to get the man to put down his weapon.

After a short standoff, the man fired his gun, and one of the Shorewood officers returned fire, striking DeJesus-Hernandez, Arnold said. DeJesus-Hernandez was pronounced dead at the scene.

""Only one officer was involved in shooting,"" Arnold said. The incident is now being investigated by the Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force.

None of the officers was not struck by gunfire when the man in the hotel parking lot fired his weapon, Arnold said.

By midnight, at least two dozen police cars from area agencies including Shorewood, Joliet, Will County, Channahon and Illinois State Police converged upon the La Quinta hotel along the frontage road. Several officers gathered around the car in the back of the parking lot, and portable lights were set up as the officers gathered evidence during the early morning hours. The last shooting at the La Quinta hotel parking lot involved a man who shot his former girlfriend before turning the gun on himself. Last Oct. 4, Shorewood police announced that 36-year-old Plainfield resident Brandon Mills died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound outside the La Quinta hotel after he shot a 28-year-old Plainfield woman.",Q1

Thursday marks 50 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and there has been a marked shift in Moscow’s approach. Ukrainian officials have warned for days they expect a major offensive by Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region.

The US and EU have pledged a combined $1.3 billion more in military aid for Ukraine as Russia prepares to launch an eastern offensive.

Meanwhile, organizations like the United Nations have warned that the prolonged war in Ukraine could lead to more problems in an already struggling global economy with food insecurity as a top concern.

Here are the latest developments:

Casualties of war: As of April 12, the civilian death toll in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24 stood at 1,932, the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said Thursday. It warned that “the actual figures are considerably higher.”

Global impact: The United Nations secretary-general has warned that the world is on the brink of a “perfect storm” as the war in Ukraine exacerbates an already struggling global economy. In a news release Wednesday, the UN said the war could lead to a “three-dimensional crisis” of food, energy and finance — areas that have already been hit hard by Covid-19 and climate change. “We are now facing a perfect storm that threatens to devastate the economies of developing countries,” Secretary-General António Guterres said.”The people of Ukraine cannot bear the violence being inflicted on them. And the most vulnerable people around the globe cannot become collateral damage in yet another disaster for which they bear no responsibility,” he said.

Key Russian warship damaged: One of the Russian Navy’s most important warships has been badly damaged in the Black Sea, a massive blow to a military struggling against Ukrainian resistance 50 days into Russia’s invasion of his neighbor. Russian sailors evacuated the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, after a fire that detonated ammunition aboard, Russia’s defense ministry said. Ukraine’s Operational Command South claimed Thursday that the Moskva had begun to sink after it was hit Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. Russia’s defense ministry said Thursday that the Moskva “remains afloat” and that measures were being taken to tow it to port. The ministry said the crew had been evacuated to other Black Sea Fleet ships in the area. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar that “there was an explosion” on the Moskva, but said the United States cannot say at this point if the ship was hit by a missile. Whatever the reason for the fire, analysts say it strikes hard at the heart of the Russian Navy as well as national pride, comparable to the US Navy losing a battleship during World War II or an aircraft carrier today.

Ukrainian National Security Advisor Oleksiy Danilov told CNN Thursday that the alleged strike on the cruiser was a very important mission for his country’s military and vowed there would be more such dramatic actions. “It is a very important mission for us. The Moskva was there near the Snake Island and was hit yesterday by two powerful Ukrainian-made missiles,” Danilov told CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen in an interview. “[Putin] came to kill our children, our women, our civilians. That is our gift to him. And this is just the beginning. There will be more than one Moskva.” The Ukrainian national security advisor went on to commend the Ukrainian military for the way they were defending the country but cautioned against underestimating the Russian military. Danilov also reiterated his country’s request for the international community to send more weapons. “We are, first of all, grateful for what we already have been given,” he said “We need helicopters, planes, powerful weapons, howitzers… We need a lot.”

Potential meeting between Zelensky and Putin: Turkey is still working on organizing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told Turkish news channel NTV on Thursday.“We know critical topics will be decided at leader level, so we will try to bring leaders together,” he said. Cavusoglu said that Turkey continues to approach the negotiations with “cautious optimism,” particularly after recent events of alleged war crimes in Bucha and Irpin which “negatively affected the process.”

The condition for a possible meeting between Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky is an agreement document ready for the two leaders to sign, the Kremlin said Thursday. Since the start of Russia’s invasion, Zelensky has repeatedly called for talks with the Russian president, but there have been no talks at the highest level so far.

Russian opposition figure urges the West to wage a social media against Putin regime: Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny has issued a series of tweets urging a new front of “truth and free information” against Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he calls the “war criminal from the Kremlin.”

Navalny, who is serving a nine-year sentence in a Russian penal colony after being convicted of fraud last month, said in his tweets that “truth and free information hit Putin’s insane regime just as hard as Javelins,” the US anti-tank weapons being used by Ukrainian forces against Russian armor.

Increased international defense aid for Ukraine: The Pentagon is working to move the $800 million worth of weapons, ammunition and other security assistance for Ukraine announced by US President Joe Biden yesterday into Ukraine as quickly as possible, a senior defense official said Thursday. “We’re under no illusion of the size and the scale of this thing. But we’re also mindful of the clock. We know time is not our friend. And we’re going to do the best we can to move this, to move these shipments as fast as we can,” the official told reporters during an off-camera briefing.

The European Union has approved an additional 500 million euros ($544 million USD) for military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Wednesday, according to a news release from the European Council of the European Union.

“The next weeks will be decisive. As Russia prepares for an offensive on the East of Ukraine, it is crucial that we continue and step up our military support to Ukraine to defend its territory and population and prevent further suffering,” said Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.",Q1

These were used in WW1 and especially in WW2 to protect Portland Harbor. You may think that World War II was fought far away from Maine, so you may be surprised by how close those nasty Nazis really got.

YouTube YouTube loading...

How Busy Was Portland Harbor in World War II?

The harbor was a hotbed of activity! The South Portland shipyards built over 235 Liberty ships between 1941 and 1945. That's around 5 ships a MONTH. Thousands of Navy men were trained on Casco Bay Islands, and the harbor was an important refueling spot. Portland Harbor was the most important harbor on the East Coast because it was the closest to Europe. It was to be protected at all costs.

How Was Portland Harbor Protected?

Once the war started, Portland Harbor was covered in explosive mines to take care of any German submarines that got too close.

The islands were busy too. Peaks Island alone has over 55 military structures, including Battery Steele. The 16-inch guns at Battery Steele were so loud and powerful that when they went off, all the windows on the island would shatter!

Fort Williams had several gun batteries and lookout towers. It's a great spot to bring the kids today, as they can climb around what's left of these important structures that defended our beloved Casco Bay.

How Close Did the Germans Get go Portland?

Closer than you think. We think of the battles being far away, but there were German U-boats REALLY close to Portland. In fact, in April of 1945, the USS Eagle exploded just three miles off the coast of Cape Elizabeth, killing 49 and injuring about a dozen. For 50 years the Navy claimed that a boiler explosion had caused the incident. Years later, the real cause came out...a torpedo from a German U-Boat! Just 3 miles away.

Listen to this amazing story of a man who was on that ship and lived to tell the tale. Freedom isn't free!

In addition to the USS Eagle, a US Navy blimp over Maine was shot down during the war. The K-14 sub-chaser blimp went down in Southwest Harbor. It was found riddled with bullet holes, but the Navy to this day blames the crash on pilot error. Many believe it was a Nazi submarine that shot down the blimp!

Were There German Spies in Maine?

I've heard stories over the years of German subs going up the Presumpscot, but I can't find anything that confirms that. You can be sure though, that there were Nazi spies in Maine and New England. We know of two that were dropped off by a German submarine in Bar Harbor. They were later found in New York City.

When the Germans surrendered in May of 1945, four German U-boats that had been in the Gulf of Maine surrendered at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Close indeed!

https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-694233,Jews must be responsible for their own safety and security - opinion,"Thankfully, the January 15 hostage situation at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, ended as it should have: With terrorist Malik Faisal Akram killed and all hostages, including Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, freed unharmed.

Akram was demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, colloquially known as “Lady Al Qaeda,” a Pakistani neuroscientist who is currently serving an 86-year sentence for the attempted murder of FBI and US Army personnel.

Siddiqui is a notorious antisemite, who declared that she did not want anyone with a “Zionist or Israeli background,” on her jury. Following her conviction, she stated that “this is a verdict coming from Israel and not from America. That’s where the anger belongs.”

Despite the FBI’s initial reluctance to clearly describe the Congregation Beth Israel hostage situation as a deliberate attack on Jews, Akram’s evil intent was obvious to Jews all over the world. Akram chose to attack Congregation Beth Israel, on Shabbat, because he knew that he would encounter Jews.

Despite many recent efforts by American Jews to distance themselves from Israel, Akram did not make such a distinction. He – like violent extremists the world over – views Jews as a collective scourge that must be eliminated. In the minds of terrorists like Akram and Siddiqi, Jews are Jews regardless of their political beliefs or where they live. AAFIA SIDDIQUI is a notorious antisemite, who declared that she did not want anyone with a ‘Zionist or Israeli background’ on her jury. (credit: FBI/REUTERS)

Although thankfully ending without the murder of innocent Jews, Saturday’s events in Colleyville were a grim reminder of the increased antisemitic events that have taken place over the last few years here in America and abroad. According to the Anti-Defamation League’s “Audit of Antisemitic Incidents,” the most recent data from 2020 details were that there were “2,024 reported antisemitic incidents throughout the country.” Moreover, this was the “third-highest year on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979.”

From Pittsburgh to Poway, the last few years have involved horrific acts of violence against the American Jewish community. And, of course, the ADL’s report does not include the terrible attacks against Israeli Jews who, this past May 2021, endured nearly two weeks of incessant rocket fire from the radical terrorist group Hamas.

The ADL’s data demonstrate that Jews are a hated people. This is a fact that, thankfully, has been allowed to be momentarily forgotten in such philosemitic societies such as the modern-day United States. But antisemitism is a pernicious and insidious force that rears its ugly head in every generation. No amount of education and advocacy will ever eliminate antisemitism, such hatred is too entrenched. Therefore, Saturday’s events, and the ADL’s data, reinforce the mindset that I have long believed: Jews must be responsible for their own safety and security.

Jewish places of worship and community must make themselves hard targets. This means that they should have both armed security, as well as encourage those congregation members with the appropriate training and credentials to be a part of that security apparatus. This may include congregation members with the appropriate state-issued licenses to conceal carry firearms during services or to participate in emergency preparedness drills with the security team.

Communication and planning are paramount to ensure that all members of the congregation or community understand what to do in an emergency. This takes more than lip service. It requires rehearsals. Most of all, there must be a mindset change and a realization that law enforcement response time will likely be slow. The Jewish community or congregation must assume that no one will come to rescue them, and must be prepared to protect themselves at all costs. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now

Such a mindset change does not eliminate the ability for the Jewish congregation or community to be welcoming and loving to the outside world. So much of what makes Judaism special – the rich community ties, the tradition, and the hope to improve the world – can still exist and perhaps increase more, through a congregation or community that knows how to protect itself.

Through increased training and readiness, Jewish communities and congregations ensure that they will be able to react quickly and effectively if an emergency arises. By changing their mindset to one of preparedness, Jewish communities and congregations ensure that they will continue to be there for future generations and not become the next Poway, Pittsburgh, or Colleyville.

https://www.pressherald.com/2022/01/20/the-maine-idea-public-health-becomes-optional-for-highest-court/,The Maine Idea: Public health becomes optional for highest court,"Last week, Gov. Janet Mills’s policies concerning COVID vaccines were vindicated by the U.S. Supreme Court, though – strangely – no one seems to have noticed.

It was Mills’s decision, early in the pandemic’s Delta variant phase, to mandate shots for health care workers at a time when the federal government was still studying the matter.

Further, Mills didn’t allow a religious exemption, sometimes a no-no for the current Supreme Court, with its expansive concern for the “free exercise of religion” clause, even where it contravenes other constitutional guarantees, such as those for public health and safety.

Now a federal program, the health worker mandate passed muster – though only by 5-4, with Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts joining the three liberal justices to uphold it.

Think of that: a regulation aimed at preventing the spread of a deadly virus to the public by the people we entrust with keeping us safe was barely acceptable to our highest legal tribunal.

By contrast, an attempt to make workplaces safe by requiring vaccinations at large businesses was scuttled, with Roberts and Kavanaugh joining four hardliners: Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Trump appointees Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.

Because the rulings came from emergency petitions, the main opinion is, by court tradition, unsigned, but it bears the chief justice’s fingerprints.

During oral arguments, Robert was highly skeptical that, without specific authorization by Congress, OSHA could act against a menace that’s already killed 852,000 Americans – possibly one million by spring.

The principal argument against the OSHA mandate seemed to be that, because people also caught the virus elsewhere, workplace safety wasn’t specifically involved.

Again, consider the court’s message. Many employees were considered “essential” from the start of the pandemic, and had to show up or be fired; until the vaccines were available, it was truly a Hobson’s choice.

Now that vaccines are available, the court says, workers must be free not to get them – as if death by virus and a requirement for a life-saving shot were equivalent.

As it happens, there was a clear precedent about requiring vaccinations, and – though the justices referenced it – in the end Roberts ignored it.

“Jacobson v. Massachusetts” was decided in 1905 by the Fuller Court – the same court that’s often faulted for its 1895 decision in “Plessy v. Ferguson,” ratifying racial segregation.

“Jacobson,” a 7-2 decision, said the city of Cambridge acted legally under a state law permitting mandatory vaccines during public health emergencies.

The facts are easily stated. Passed during a serious smallpox outbreak, the ordinance required all adults to be vaccinated, with a $5 fine for violations – the equivalent of $140 today. It was far more stringent than anything OSHA proposed, or any other agency even contemplated during this pandemic.

A minister filed suit. He’d had a serious reaction when, as a boy back in Sweden, he’d been inoculated; unlike COVID vaccines, the smallpox vaccine sometimes had fatal consequences.

Justice John Harlan said the Massachusetts law did not violate the 14th Amendment: “The liberty secured by the Constitution does not impart an absolute right in each person to be at all times, and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint,” and that “It is within the police power of a state to enact a compulsory vaccine law.”

Chief Justice Melville Fuller, a Maine native, concurred, as did five other justices. Only two judges, who today would be characterized as doctrinaire libertarians, dissented.

Executive agencies like OSHA didn’t exist in 1905, and the court has often upheld Congress’s ability to delegate decisions like this one.

What was different here? Clearly, the court’s current political orientation, and its willingness to use its considerable authority to strike down policies with which it merely disagrees.

It’s also worth remembering that the Fuller court, while upholding the public health ordinance, struck down many state laws it saw as interfering with the private property rights of corporations, including laws concerning minimum wages, child labor, and working conditions for women.

Yet even a court thoroughly committed to “liberty of contract” principles made an exception for a deadly communicable disease spreading unchecked.

At this late stage of the pandemic, it’s unlikely the court’s latest pronouncements will have a major impact on the death rate from COVID. But as a legal precedent, it’s both worrisome and shocking.

A Congress that has freely handed over its power to declare war to presidents, with no significant judicial check, must now precisely calibrate each public health emergency as it unfolds, and tailor laws to meet it – or face the possibility the Supreme Court will render the government’s response null and void.

We are not even officially at the end of January 2022, and already there have been fourteen deaths in homes in our state according to the Office of the State Fire Marshal.

The latest house fire death happened at around 3 o'clock Saturday morning when a fire broke out in a home in the 300 block of Collins Avenue in Bastrop.

One person inside of the home was able to get out safely and then did everything they could to try to get the other person out according to fire officials. The person got no response from the victim who was inside of a bedroom.

When firefighters arrived on the scene, they began to battle the blaze. They were able to determine that there were no working smoke alarms in the home. The body of the man was found inside a bedroom in the home.

Investigators are still working to figure out all of the circumstances surrounding this house fire.

State Fire Marshal Butch Browning's office reports the number of people who have died in house fires so far this year is three times the amount of lives lost when compared to this same time last year.

Browning's officials remind everyone that having a working smoke alarm in your home is imperative. Smoke alarms save lives. If it's a matter of money, they suggest that you contact your local fire department to find out whether or not they have a free one that can be installed by professionals of your local fire department. Many areas do have these smoke alarms as part of the Operation Save-A-Life program.

In addition, you can register for a smoke alarm at lasfm.org.

https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2022/03/08/federal-law-enforcement-focuses-on-violent-crime-in-helena-west-helena/,Federal Law Enforcement Focuses on Violent Crime in Helena-West Helena,"HELENA-WEST HELENA-The FBI and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas have announced their increased focus on prosecuting violent crime in Helena-West Helena. United States Attorney Jonathan D. Ross announced today that 25 defendants in the Helena-West Helena area have been charged in federal indictments alleging various violent crimes including felon in possession of a firearm, possession of stolen bank funds, and interstate travel to have sex with a minor.

The most recent of these indictments, handed down by a federal grand jury on March 2, 2022, charges Michael Rogers with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Rogers is being investigated for the shooting that took place at the Helena-West Helena Christmas parade last year, cancelling the parade.

In addition to Rogers, 20 other defendants in the Helena-West Helena area have been charged since 2020 with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Three defendants have already been convicted and are awaiting sentencing: Walter Thornton, Jr.; Raymond Clark; and Carlton Otey. Frank Norton has been convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison, which is the statutory maximum. Nicholas Dismuke has been convicted of both being a felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime and sentenced to more than 18 years in prison. The remaining defendants, listed below, are awaiting trial.

In addition to felon in possession of a firearm cases, three additional defendants are charged with other crimes. Fleming Ivory has been convicted of interstate travel with the intent to engage in sexual conduct with a minor and is awaiting sentencing. Vann Bragg has been indicted for conspiracy to possess stolen bank funds and is awaiting trial, and Dedrick Bragg has been convicted of the same charge and is awaiting sentencing.

“These cases signify the presence of federal law enforcement in Helena-West Helena and the surrounding communities,” stated Ross. “Local communities deserve to be free from the effects of violence, and we will swiftly and forcefully respond to make communities in our district safer. There will be more prosecutions to come, and criminals in the Delta should know that we will not tolerate their violence and disregard of the law.”

“The FBI is working closely with local and state police agencies to combat the scourge of violent crime,” said FBI Little Rock Special Agent in Charge James A. Dawson. “To the criminals operating in the Delta, be warned— an arsenal of federal resources now opposes you. Alongside our partners at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, we will bring the full weight of the federal government down on the violent gangs terrorizing our Delta communities.”

The FBI is working these cases with the assistance of the Helena-West Helena Police Department. The cases are being prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

The defendants awaiting trial for being a felon in possession of a firearm are:

– Michael Rogers;

– Demario Richardson;

– Xavier Hudson;

– Antonio Dolphin;

– Donterious Troope;

– Demarico Hay;

– Tylin Ezell;

No masks required! And the discounted $100 pre-registration is good through March 1 at: ctc.osu.edu.

The annual Conservation Tillage and Technology Conference will be held March 8-9 at the McIntosh Center of Ohio Northern University, 525 S. Main St., in Ada. CTC is presented by The Ohio State University College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) and other supporters.

Certified Crop Adviser (CCA) continuing education credits are available, with an emphasis on soil and water management, crop management and nutrient management. Plenty of Certified Livestock Manager (CLM) credits are also available.

The event focuses on providing information to farmers on promoting and maintaining soil health, said Randall Reeder, a retired Ohio State University Extension agricultural engineer.

From offering a workshop on “Water and Drainage Laws-What is new in Ohio,” and a discussion on “Corn Management Today, Does Chasing the Last Bushel Pay,” the two-day event is designed to provide opportunities “for farmers and crop consultants to learn about the latest technology and practices for conserving soil and improving water quality and how that can boost their financial bottom line while conserving their soils,” Reeder said.

Farmers are interested in building soil health for the future while the same time preserving their soils for now, Reeder said.

“And adopting continuous no-till and other practices that build soil health will impact climate change in the right way. Famers are becoming more efficient and environmentally aware about their soils’ health as an important factor in improving the future for themselves and future generations,” he said.

Reeder is an organizer of this year’s CTC in conjunction with OSU Extension, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Soil and Water Conservation Districts of Northwest Ohio. OSU Extension is the outreach arm of CFAES.

CTC offers the latest research, insight, tips and techniques on precision fertility, cover crops and manure, water management, technology and equipment, nutrient management, and advanced cover crops. It features some 70 presenters, including 32 CFAES researchers and Extension educators, 22 from other universities, as well as USDA, ODA, farmers, and industry representatives.

The event begins with a General Session at 8:30 a.m. March 8. The keynote speaker is internationally known Steve Groff, Lancaster, PA. His topic is: The Future-Proof Farm: Changing Mindsets in a Changing World. Starting at 10:00 a.m., for two days, the conference features concurrent sessions. Topics to be discussed will include:

Planting Date and Management Interactions: Corn, Soybeans & Wheat

Weed Management in 2022

Incorporating Manure into Wheat using a Grassland Applicator

https://augustafreepress.com/laura-finley-the-dangerous-trend-of-the-parents-rights-movement/,Laura Finley: The dangerous trend of the ‘parents rights’ movement,"Given the current political divide and his ambitions to be the next Republican presidential candidate it should not be surprising that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he supports what has been called the “Don’t Say Gay” bill going through the state House of Representatives. Not surprising, no, but disgusting, yes.

One notices in “Parental Rights in Education,” a portion of the bill reads “A school district may not encourage classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not age appropriate…” While the idea of age appropriateness does not sound objectionable on its face, who determines that? And, according to the bill, elementary school kids would not be told that some students have two moms or two dads? Because in reality, some of them do.

This wave to give parents greater authority over what schools teach is not exclusive to Florida, nor to this issue. The conservative “parent’s rights” movement is arguing that parents have a right to control school curriculum. Many states have banned the teaching of “Critical Race Theory,” an approach to teaching racial injustice, despite the fact that almost no K-12 teachers were even doing so.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita introduced a “Parents Bill of Rights” that says, “education policy and curriculum should accurately reflect the values of Indiana families.” A recent Florida law is similar. Some states allow parents to sue schools for teaching banned concepts. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin announced at several rallies, “I believe parents should be in charge of their kids’ education.”

The problem is that common law and case law does not guarantee parents any such right to control public school curriculum. Parents should be involved, but do not and should not dictate curriculum.

In addition to disregarding the children who are being raised by same-sex couples, these kinds of laws will likely have a chilling effect on teachers who work with older students. While not necessarily prohibited, many schools and teachers will not want to invite controversy so will simply avoid these topics. Of course, that is obviously the point.

It is imperative that we let educators do what they are trained to do, teach. Legislative efforts to interfere with that under the guise of supporting parents is absurd and will only result in children and teens finding information, correct or not, from their peers and other sources outside of school.",Q1

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Hundreds of protesters gathered in Venoy Park in St. Petersburg Saturday trying to send a message to Moscow to end the violence and stop the invasion.

People were encouraged to take their anger, sadness, and fears to the mic by expressing loud and clear that they demand peace in the region.

“I just can’t believe that my children and I are seeing a war in this day and age. It’s just terrifying,” said Lena Slywka, who was one of the protesters there. “I’m 100% Ukrainian. My father was born in western Ukraine,” said Slywka. She said her father left Ukraine when he was just seven years old and though most of her family has immigrated to the United States, she is concerned for her family who is still there. “Our families are all terrified over there deciding the men have to stay and fight and want to stay and fight. They don’t want to leave their country,” said Slywka.

Nataliya Kolislychenko was born in Ukraine but has been living in the United States for 16 years. She also has still has family there and is concerned for their safety. “I have my mom, dad, my sister, and my niece are still there,” said Kolislychenko. This as the Ukrainian government reports nearly 200 deaths since the invasion started.

Nicole Ford is a professor at the University of Tampa. She is an expert in matters dealing with Russia and Ukraine. She said there are many reasons why Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, but one of the main ones is based on the idea that Ukraine was originally part of the Russian Emperor. “It ends up being an existential threat to the entirety of Europe when you have a world leader who is advocating an ethnonational argument.”

She says the United States and Europe should continue to heavily arm the Ukrainians to continue to defend themselves and continue to enforce tougher sanctions on Russian oligarchs.

https://www.mcknights.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-mandate-deadlines-push-providers/,COVID-19 vaccine mandate deadlines push providers,"With every state but Texas now covered by a federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate with specific deadlines, providers are facing increased urgency around ongoing vaccination campaigns.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services late Friday announced requirements for 24 states where a federal mandate was allowed to move forward by a Jan. 13 Supreme Court decision.

Those states must ensure workers have one shot by Feb. 13, the agency said in a memo to surveyors. It added that employees in the newly covered states must be fully vaccinated by March 15.

The memo largely mirrors COVID-19 vaccine mandate guidance issued Dec. 28. That version covered 25 other states, Washington, D.C, and territories. It was issued after the removal of an earlier injunction by a lower federal court. Workers in those states must have at least one shot by Jan. 27, with full vaccination required by Feb. 28.

Together, the enforcement memos cover anyone in a patient-facing position in about 15,000 nursing homes accepting either Medicare or Medicaid funding. An injunction remains in effect in Texas, so providers there are currently exempt from the CMS mandate. On Friday, however, the administration filed an appeal to have that injunction lifted.

Numbers remain below vaccine mandate threshold

CMS has said that facilities with vaccination rates under 100% will have a failsafe as enforcement begins. Those with more than 80% of workers vaccinated after 30 days and a plan to achieve a 100% staff vaccination rate within 60 days would not be subject to additional enforcement action, the agency said.

The vaccination rate among nursing home workers had crept up to 80.3% nationally per recent CMS data. But 27 states had averages below that. Missouri had the lowest at 66.4%, according to data reported to CMS by Dec. 26.

Some states reported far lower numbers in pockets before the COVID-19 vaccine mandate was allowed to proceed.

New vaccine mandate deadlines leads to high anxiety

Many are concerned about losing workers as the newly established deadline for first shots draws near.

Among them is Betsy Johnson, president of the Kentucky Association of Health Care Facilities. The organization represents about 85% of the state’s roughly 300 nursing homes. Kentucky facilities had 76.2% of workers fully vaccinated as of late last month.

KAHCF found in a November poll that the state had about 3,000 job vacancies across the skilled nursing sector. About 57% of respondents said they could be forced to close without some workforce solutions.

One of the main reasons workers have given for leaving the field? Vaccinations.

“KAHCF/KCAL stands strong with our long-term care facilities throughout Kentucky dealing with crippling staffing shortages while still battling a dangerous virus,” Johnson told McKnight’s Saturday. She added that vaccines are “the best way to prevent and fight this deadly pandemic.”

The association is working closely with state government leaders and medical experts. The goal is to ensure providers “are equipped and ready for any issues, including any workforce shortages that are occurring and will continue due to the vaccine mandate,” Johnson added.

Vaccine mandate winners and losers

A CMS official told McKnight’s Friday that the agency is moving “full speed ahead” to implement the mandate.

Also Friday, CMS acknowledged it had refined its estimate of workers covered by its rule. When the rule was first announced in November, federal officials estimated some 17 million, or 80% of 22 million U.S. healthcare workers, would be required to get vaccinated. In its regulatory impact analysis, the agency lowered that estimate to 10.4 million employees.

The new guidance came on the heels of the Supreme Court’s split rulings over vaccine mandates for U.S. workers. The High Court voted 5-4 to lift two injunctions and allow the CMS healthcare worker mandate to move forward. Appeals continue to play out in lower courts. Justices also blocked a broader Occupational Safety and Health Administration mandate aimed at companies with 100 or more employees.

Harvard health policy researcher David Grabowski, Ph.D., at the time bemoaned the split. He Tweeted that nursing homes “will lose workers to businesses w/out mandates.”

AMDA, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, echoed those concerns Monday.

“The stay also provides a path for vaccine-hesitant nursing home staff to move to assisted living or another work venue that does not require vaccination,” Executive Director Christopher E. Laxton said in a statement.

AMDA also encouraged nursing homes nationwide to adopt its standardized medical exemption request form as more staff members are expected to pursue that option in coming weeks. The organization’s list of acceptable medical reasons not to complete a COVID-19 vaccine includes severe adverse reaction after a previous dose of or component of the vaccine, and active myocarditis or COVID-19 infection.

While staff providing telemedicine or support services outside of the facility are not subject to the healthcare worker mandate, CMS reminded Friday that most other personnel are.

“Regardless of clinical responsibility or resident contact, the policies and procedures must apply to …. facility staff, who provide any care, treatment, or other services for the facility and/or its residents,” the CMS memo said. It listed applicable individuals as: facility employees, licensed practitioners, students, trainees, volunteers, and “individuals who provide care, treatment, or other services for the facility and/or its residents, under contract or by other arrangement.”",Q1

""As of this moment, I am convinced he has made the decision. We have reason to believe that,"" Biden said at the White House. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv.” The president cited U.S. intelligence but providing no details to support his assertion. Biden said diplomacy remains open to prevent war until Putin actually begins an attack.

Russia and Russia-backed forces in Ukraine appeared to have launched a coordinated propaganda and information warfare campaign on Friday that U.S. and allied officials said they fear may be a pretext for an imminent invasion of Russian forces into Ukraine.

Russian proxy forces in Eastern Ukraine made new, unverified claims that the Ukrainian government was about to stage an unprovoked attack. They also announced an “evacuation” of 700,000 people in Russian-occupied Ukraine territory under the pretext of a looming Ukrainian invasion.

""There is simply no evidence to these assertions and it defies basic logic,” to claim Ukraine is trying to escalate or commit genocide, Biden said. ""We have reason to believe"" Russia is preparing to attack ""within days.""

Biden said he is unsure why Putin is reportedly planning to oversee Russia’s nuclear force exercises this weekend. “I do not think he is remotely contemplating using nuclear weapons,” Biden said, but wondered if it may be cover for Russia’s recent claims of military exercises or just to show force. “It’s hard to read his mind.”

Ukrainian officials earlier had refuted the claims, saying they had no intention of staging an attack against Russian forces in Ukraine. “We categorically refute Russian disinformation reports on Ukraine’s alleged offensive operations or acts of sabotage in chemical production facilities. Ukraine does not conduct or plan any such actions in the Donbas. We are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said on Twitter.

The foreign ministers of France and Germany, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Annalena Baerbock, issued a rare joint statement on Friday saying, “We do not see any grounds for these allegations and urge Russia to use its influence over the self-proclaimed republics to encourage restraint and contribute to de-escalation. We are concerned that staged incidents could be misused as a pretext for possible military escalation.”

Ukrainian military intelligence issued a statement warning that Russian forces were hiding explosives in several buildings in Donetsk, as reports of shelling and civilian casualties in the region surfaced.

Overnight, artillery fell on a kindergarten in a village in Luhansk and observers recorded a major escalation in ceasefire violations.

Analysts said Russia-aligned groups’ claims that Ukraine was about to attack appeared to be previously recorded messages. Denis Pushilin, who heads the Russian proxy group the Donetsk People’s Republic, released a video over Telegram urging women, children, and the elderly to relocate to Russia and claiming that Ukraine was about to launch a major attack on the region. Leonid Pasichnyk, head of the Luhansk People’s Republic, did the same.

But Aric Toler, a member of the open source intelligence group Bellingcat, pointed out that the metadata from both the Telegram messages showed that the videos were actually recorded two days earlier, on Feb 16. Journalists on the ground reported that residents were confused by the separatist leaders’ claims , doubted the justification for air raid sirens, and weren’t sure if the evacuation was real.

Russian media carried footage of the ‘evacuations’ but Western journalists, such as Buzzfeed’s Christopher Miller, were highly-skeptical and said unsolicited footage provided by the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic appeared to be staged.

Also on Friday, White House officials attributed the disruptive denial of service attacks that hit Ukrainian banks and defense entities this week to Russia. The attacks emanated from Russian military sources ""transmitting high volumes of communication to Ukraine based IP addresses and domains,"" Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters at the White House.

Friday’s events occurred after weeks of warnings from U.S. government officials that Russia would likely stage a false attack to justify an attack on Ukraine in the days ahead.

Dmitri Alapovitch, one of the founders of cybersecurity company Crowdstrike and currently the head of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, said on Twitter: “It’s truly amazing that Russia is appearing to try to convince everyone that Ukrainians decided to commit ‘genocide’ in the Donbas at the very moment that Russia has built the largest invasion force in Europe in 50+ years on its borders. They waited 8 years to start doing it NOW!”

Her Past Tells A More Complex Story,"People place flowers and candles for Ashli Babbit, an Air Force veteran who was shot and killed in the U.S Capitol building on January 06. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.

Norris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.

“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”

Terrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.

The attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.

Trump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.

But the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, is far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.

Babbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.

On social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.

Her Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.

“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”

Among Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.

Trump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.

A Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.

Key to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.

Aaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.

“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.

That is not how Norris felt about her.

Court records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.

Norris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.

“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”

When she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.

“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.

Norris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.

A few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.

Norris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.

When the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.

After Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.

Norris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.

A case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.

Court records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.

Photos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.

Following the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.

A copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.

In the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.

No transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.

In February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.

“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”

In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.

By then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.

Ashli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”

In the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.

In his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”

“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary.” - Aaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III

Aaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”

“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.

The Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.

Alex Stein left Dallas City Hall officials completely gobsmacked after performing a satirical 'Covid rap' at an open microphone session on Wednesday morning.

Peculiar video footage shows Stein, who is a frequent speaker at City Council open mics, launching into a 'Covid rap', which includes lines such as 'vaccinate me in my thong' and 'vaccination freak-a-leek'.

In the clip, a voice is heard introducing 'Alexander Stein' before the YouTuber walks down and stands in front of politicians wearing a face mask and blue scrubs.

Introducing himself, he says: 'My name's Alex Stein, I'm here today because we gotta vaccinate our children, you know we really don't have enough vaccines, like they're not mandatory, and that's the problem, we've gotta mandate these vaccines.'

Stein, whose mother is understood to have died from Covid age 60 in October, then goes on to say that he has found a way to make the subject of vaccines more 'hip and cool'.

After having technical difficulties with his phone, which was meant to play a song alongside his rap, Stein decides to perform the satirical pro-vaccination rap acapella.

Stein, who is known for his skits and pranks, begins his cringeworthy rap with the line, 'will the real Dr Fauci please stand up?', copying Eminem's famous song The Real Slim Shady.

In the two-minute long rap, Stein spits bars such as 'vaccinate your babies, vaccinate them, even if they have rabies', 'vaccinate your DNA, vaccine created by the CIA' and 'you gonna get corona from Mona'.

At one point, Stein, also known as Prime Time #99 Alex Stein, grabs a bottle of hand sanitizer and squirts it all over his head before rubbing it into his hair and face.

He then uses wet wipes to clean the microphone before wiping them across his forehead and spinning the cloths around in his hands while dancing.

Stein, who is believed to describe himself as a conspiracy theorist, ends his bizarre song by telling City Hall officials to 'follow my Instagram'.

Speaking about the rap to the Daily Dot, former stand-up comedian Stein said he went to the open microphone session and 'played the buffoon'.

He told the publication: 'I was really trying to be cringe and trying to be stupid.'

Stein insisted he is not trying to be hurtful with his videos and said he understands how deadly Covid-19 can be, as his mother died of the virus age 60 in October.

He said he saw a TikTok dancing video that a nurse had made while he was visiting his mother in the intensive care unit, which he described as 'a little insensitive'.

Stein also said his political views don't fit neatly into a box and said that the 'right is just as crazy as the left', saying he believes people should be free to make their own medical choices.

He told Daily Dot that he is a conspiracy theorist who believes the world is run by multinational corporations, claiming that is why pharmaceutical companies are profiting from the Covid vaccine.

Stein made a name for himself as he attempted to become 'the most epic villain in the history of reality TV' on ABC's The Glass House in 2012, listing his housemates' flaws before he was eliminated.

More recently, he has turned to making satirical YouTube videos and doing pranks and skits, one of which saw him dress up in a The Handmaid's Tale costume.

One of his schticks involves delivering satirical public comments at government meetings, like he did in Dallas, and he has previously claimed to be a Halliburton employee paralyzed in Iraq at a community police oversight board meeting.

news@seacoastonline.com

HAMPTON — The community is mourning the loss of Robert ""Renny"" Cushing, a long-time Hampton state representative who is being remembered as a ""tireless and passionate advocate for New Hampshire"" and for making a real difference in people's lives.

Cushing, 69, died Monday surrounded by loved ones after a nearly two-year battle with stage 4 prostate cancer.

""A true public servant, he dedicated his entire life to the betterment of others,"" stated Acting Deputy Democratic Leader Mary Jane Wallner.

""New Hampshire lost a fearless warrior, but his legacy will live on through the lives he has changed, the stories he’s shared, and the very real ways he left New Hampshire better than he found it,” said Senate Democratic Leader Donna Soucy.

House Bill 1645:Renny Cushing tells panel about his dad’s murder by Hampton police officer

Cushing stepped down last week from his position as House Democratic minority leader to take a medical leave of absence to focus on his cancer battle. In his statement to the Democratic Caucus, Cushing wrote, ""I have fought my entire life for the people of New Hampshire and served in the legislature for more than 20 years — but for now, I need to focus on another fight.""

Cushing was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer in August 2020. The cancer had already metastasized in his bones and lungs and he was told without treatment that he would have between nine and 18 months to live.

With full knowledge of his diagnosis, he took on the Democratic minority leader position telling his colleagues he would focus on ""finding common ground in the fight for the common good.""

And fight he did.

As the coronavirus spread, not only did he defend Democratic principles but also waged an unsuccessful legal fight to allow lawmakers with serious medical conditions to participate in legislative sessions remotely.

""My regret is that he didn’t have a chance to be the majority leader when he had his full strength, when he still had his fastball, so to speak,"" said Chris Muns, president of the Hampton Democratic Committee. ""What’s happening today wouldn’t be happening if he had been leader 10 years ago.""

Muns called Cushing ""a master parliamentarian in the House.""

Others like Jim Splaine, a former Portsmouth Democratic state representative and state senator for some 30 years, called him ""the most effective legislator in the past 25 years.""

""He didn't compromise for the sake of getting something through,"" Splaine said. ""He believed what he believed and he fought for it until he won.""

'He didn't raise his voice. He just made his case'

Cushing was drawn to politics early in life as an opponent of the Vietnam War, advocating to lower the voting age from 21 to 18.

He was also a founding member of the Clamshell Alliance, which was formed in the mid-1970s to oppose a proposed nuclear power plant in Seabrook.

""He had passion throughout his life going all the way back '70s,"" Splaine said. ""He had this amazing energy. You saw a controlled passion whenever he spoke on an issue. He didn't raise his voice. He just made his case.""

Splaine said Cushing was among more than 1,400 protesters arrested at the site of the plant on April 10, 1977. Though later demonstrations led by splinter groups turned violent, the earlier sit-in was peaceful and served as a model for other anti-nuclear campaigns across the United States.

""I think more people realize the consequences of the nuclear age,"" Cushing said at a rally marking the protest's 10-year anniversary. ""People who did not consider themselves activists are waking up and saying: 'I was fooled. Nuclear power isn't clean and it isn't safe.""'

'One of Renny’s biggest accomplishments' - abolishing the NH death penalty

Cushing was first elected to the House in 1996, and was serving his eighth non-consecutive term in Concord at the time of his death.

He was known for pushing progressive causes.

Renny Cushing: Dying while legislating — 'There’s no end of the work to do'

""One of Renny’s biggest accomplishments and a joy for colleagues in the House to witness, was abolishing the death penalty in New Hampshire,"" said Acting Democratic Leader Rep. David Cote, D-Nashua.

Cushing spent more than 20 years trying to repeal the state's death penalty law, finally achieving victory in 2019 when lawmakers overrode a veto by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.

His testimony in support of the repeal, where he spoke about his personal experience after both his father and brother-in-law were murdered, is still talked about to this day.

""If we let those who kill turn us into killers, then evil triumphs and we all lose,"" he said in March 2019.

Cushing's father was murdered June 1, 1988, by off-duty police officer Robert McLaughlin, who shot the schoolteacher in the chest at the door to his house. His brother-in-law was shot and killed in Tennessee in 2011.

""What I came to realize is that (capital punishment) would only compound the family tragedy,"" Cushing said in a 2019 interview on why he spent decades fighting for the repeal. ""Not only would my father be dead, but so too the values he instilled in me.""

Cushing founded Murder Victims' Families for Human Rights, and as its executive director, traveled the country speaking on behalf of victims against the death penalty.

'A passionate and dedicated public servant'

Splaine said Cushing was instrumental in getting his bill approved legalizing same-sex marriage in New Hampshire in 2009.

Splaine said it was Cushing who recommended that he postpone the vote because the votes were not there that day. Splaine followed that advice and a week later it passed by a vote of 186-179.

""Renny knew parliamentary procedures and he was a great vote counter,"" Splaine said. ""We would not have been the fifth state to adopt marriage equality without him.""

In recent years, Cushing championed the legalization of medical marijuana, drinking water standards, the clean up of the Coakley Landfill and the the construction of a secure psychiatric facility to serve patients currently held in a prison unit.

""He was highly respected amongst his peers in the House and throughout the State of New Hampshire,"" said House Speaker Sherman Packard, R-Londonderry. ""He was a passionate and dedicated public servant - never afraid to take on controversial issues for the sake of bettering this great state.""

A champion for Hampton

Nancy Stiles, former Republican District 24 state senator, said ""Renny was committed to representing Hampton.""

She said they worked together to secure funding for the $14.5 million redevelopment project of Hampton Beach, as well as the new Hampton District Courthouse.

""He was a great representative for Hampton,"" Stiles said.

""He loves Hampton and he loves the history of Hampton,"" Muns said. ""Renny’s bill to exonerate Goody Cole (who was convicted of witchcraft in Hampton in 1656) is an example of how he brought together his love of Hampton with his passion for social justice.

""The only thing he loves more than Hampton is his family,"" Muns said. ""His biggest legacy is his three daughters, who inherited his passion for life and his sense of right and wrong and the adage of ‘doing good trouble.’""

The next morning, Vicha Ratanapakdee was assaulted while on a walk in San Francisco and died, becoming yet another Asian victim of violence in America.

On Sunday, Monthanus Ratanapakdee marked the one-year anniversary of her father’s death with a rally in the San Francisco neighborhood where the 84-year-old was killed. She was joined by San Francisco Mayor London Breed, local leaders and several hundred people who came out to say they would stay silent no more.

“It’s been traumatizing to see this again and again happen to people who look like you,” said Natassia Kwan, an attorney and rally organizer. “Today, we’re going to say it’s not okay for our elders and women to be pushed into subway tracks, to be killed, to be beaten. We deserve better.”

“I really want my father’s death to not be in vain,” said Ratanapakdee, 49, a food safety inspector with the San Francisco Unified School District. “I wouldn’t want anyone to feel this pain.”

Asians in America have long been subject to prejudice and discrimination, but the attacks escalated sharply after the coronavirus first appeared in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. More than 10,000 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were reported to the Stop AAPI Hate coalition from March 2020 through September 2021.

A Cook County jury sentenced Lathem, a former Feinberg School of Medicine professor, to 53 years in prison Tuesday after finding him guilty of first-degree murder in October.

Content warning: This story contains mentions of knife violence, suicide and death.

Former Feinberg School of Medicine Prof. Wyndham Lathem was sentenced to 53 years in prison Tuesday for the 2017 fatal stabbing of his boyfriend, 26-year-old hair stylist Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.

A Cook County jury found Lathem, 47, guilty of first-degree murder in October following a week of testimony.

NU fired Lathem in 2017 after he fled the Chicago area following the murder.

Lathem and Andrew Warren, who prosecutors said Lathem paid to come to Chicago as part of a pact to kill each other and Cornell-Duranleau, stabbed Cornell-Duranleau more than 70 times on July 27, 2017. According to prosecutors, the killing was part of a premeditated sexual fantasy of “killing others and then themselves.” Warren, who was an Oxford University financial officer at the time of the murder, testified that he agreed to kill Cornell-Duranleau at Lathem’s suggestion.

During his trial, Lathem testified that he hid in the bathroom while Warren stabbed Cornell-Duranleau during what began as a methamphetamine-fueled sexual encounter involving the three men.

However, Warren, who pleaded guilty in 2019 under a plea agreement that called for him to testify against Lathem, testified that he did stab Cornell-Duranleau, but only after Lathem had already begun stabbing him.

Under questioning from the prosecutor, Lathem said he did not try to stop Warren from stabbing his boyfriend and took a shower before the two fled together.

Lathem’s testimony also contradicted what he said in a video he emailed his parents days after the murder.

“He trusted me completely and felt safe with me, and I betrayed that,” Lathem said on the video, which was played twice at his trial. “I took that all away when I killed him.”

When sentencing Lathem, Cook County judge Charles Burns described the killing as “cold-blooded” and an “execution.”

https://www.miragenews.com/tracing-evolution-of-galaxy-clusters-742916/,Tracing evolution of galaxy clusters,"University of Rochester

Scientists from Rochester, Chicago, and Oxford have replicated for the first time in a laboratory setting conditions that exist within galaxy clusters, some of the largest known structures in the universe.

In 2013, a team of American and Hungarian astronomers discovered the largest known structure in the observable universe: a supercluster of galaxies they named the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall. The Great Wall is so wide that light would take 10 billion years to move across it.

To better understand how superclusters evolve, scientists need to understand the inner workings of the building blocks of superclusters-galaxy clusters, which are thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity. For example, how is energy injected into the plasma that comprises galaxy clusters? How is this energy spread around to heat the entire enormous system?

""This work opens a new, experimental path to address a long-standing astrophysical question: Why are the cores of galaxy clusters so hot, despite the copious amounts of radiation they emit?""-Petros Tzeferacos

An international team of scientists from the University of Rochester, Oxford University, and the University of Chicago was able to demonstrate in a laboratory setting for the first time how thermal conduction is suppressed in a plasma-causing galaxy clusters to be hotter than expected-by replicating conditions that are characteristic of the conditions that exist within galaxy clusters. The research, published in the journal Science Advances, provides insights into the complex physical processes at play within the building blocks of our universe.

""This work opens a new, experimental path to address a long-standing astrophysical question: Why are the cores of galaxy clusters so hot, despite the copious amounts of radiation they emit? Accounting for this energy budget will help us understand how galaxy clusters evolve and how their large-scale structure is set up,"" says Petros Tzeferacos, an associate professor of physics and astronomy and a senior scientist at Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE). Tzeferacos is also the director of the Flash Center for Computational Science, which recently moved to Rochester from Chicago, and contributed to the experiments.

Replicating the conditions in galaxy clusters

Most of the matter that makes up galaxy clusters is in the form of a plasma-a hot soup of free-moving electrons and ions-that is threaded by magnetic fields and is in a turbulent state, moving in a random fashion much like smoke from a chimney. Scientists have previously studied galaxy clusters and the heat conduction in a plasma using observations and inputting data into theoretical models. However, they faced a difficult conundrum: the galaxy clusters in their simulations all appeared to be much hotter than scientists would expect, according to physical laws.

Until now, scientists had never been able to experimentally replicate the turbulent plasma that exists within galaxy clusters. To do so, the researchers used high-powered lasers at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).

In the experiments, laser beams were used to vaporize plastic foils and generate a turbulent and magnetized plasma, similar to the laser-driven experiments the team performed at the LLE to demonstrate the turbulent dynamo mechanismfor the first time.

The researchers found that the electrons in the plasma collide infrequently with each other and end up following the tangled magnetic field lines. This phenomenon suppresses heat conduction, giving rise to pockets of hot plasma that cannot escape, causing the cores of galaxy clusters to be much hotter than anticipated.

""This work is an important stepping stone in understanding microscopic processes that occur in plasmas that are both magnetized and turbulent,"" says Gianluca Gregori, a professor of physics at the University of Oxford, who was the principal investigator in these experiments. ""The experimental findings are surprising, as they demonstrate that energy is transported in ways that are very different from what we would have expected from simple theories.""

Utilizing the FLASH code

In order to design and interpret the laser experiments, the researchers used simulations developed at the Flash Center for Computational Science, using the multi-physics simulation code FLASH.

""The FLASH simulations and our previous LLE experiments were key for untangling the physics at play in the turbulent, magnetized plasma,"" Tzeferacos says. ""The level of thermal transport suppression, however, was still beyond what we expected.""

Further experiments will seek to better understand the microscopic mechanism that is ultimately responsible for the suppression of heat conduction that the researchers observed.

The research was funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the US DOE Office of Science Fusion Energy Sciences (FES), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the European Research Council (ERC), and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The Discovery Science program of the US DOE NNSA provided the collaboration with access to the NIF.

https://www.wmar2news.com/news/local-news/family-wants-change-after-dogs-were-kept-by-aaco-for-over-a-year,Family wants change after dogs were kept by AACo for over a year,"MILLERSVILLE, Md (WMAR) — After a yearlong battle, the two dogs blamed for killing a cat in Anne Arundel County are back with their family.

Now that the fight for their lives is over, the family, their supporters and attorneys are fighting for change.

“We don’t want this to happen to anybody else ever,” said Wendy Cozzone, the owner of Cheryl’s Rescue Ranch, who coordinated a GoFundMe for the family.

Lucy, an Akita, and Odin, an American Bully, have been home since Friday and are already back to their lovable, happy, playful selves.

“It’s been amazing having my little buddy back. He’s been sleeping with me, cuddling, playing,” said Dale Dillon, Odin’s owner.

Lucy and Odin lived at Anne Arundel County Animal Care and Control for over a year, accused of getting out their front door and attacking and killing a neighbor’s cat.

“These poor dogs suffered for a very long time,” said Stephanie Kimbrell, the family’s attorney.

Lucy and Odin were sentenced to death because they were deemed vicious. It stems from a 2017 law to prevent dogs that kill other domesticated animals from returning to their communities.

A small dog named Lilo was killed by an at-large dog who was later allowed to return to its owner. In response, the County Council unanimously passed Lilo’s Law, creating a “vicious animal” designation and a mandate that a vicious animal be euthanized.

“We shouldn’t have a law where if a dog kills a small, furry animal in the woods, that that dog can be put down for that,"" said Kimbrell.

“I was shocked when I read the law. That it was so clear and such a low bar to deem a dog vicious and that’s what happened here,” said Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman.

Pittman said when he heard about the case a few months ago, he questioned how these dogs, who had no history of aggression towards other animals or humans, could be put down.

“I have a dog named Lucy at home and I thought about my kids who have guinea pigs and how careful they have to be to close the door so that the dog doesn’t get in with the guinea pigs. Those guinea pigs are domesticated animals, and if Lucy killed one of the guinea pigs, I don’t think that deeming Lucy vicious and euthanizing her would solve any problems. In fact, it would be tragic,” said Pittman.

At the end of January, during the family’s last appeal effort, a Court of Appeals judge sided with them, saying there wasn’t enough evidence to put the dogs down because there was no credible information about what precipitated the incident.

It was then that Pittman said he asked the Office of Law to settle the case and get the dogs home. The two parties went back and forth and eventually made an agreement with lots of conditions, including anti-climbing and digging fencing and signage, to return Lucy and Odin and downgrade their designation to dangerous.

“We are very grateful for any help he [Pittman] was. We just wish instead of January 2022, it would have been January 2021,” said Cozzone.

Despite Cozzone and the dog’s owners saying they made multiple calls to Pittman’s office since April of last year, he said he has no record of that.

“The first I heard about it, there was this petition drive and it was online and that’s when I was made aware of it and at that point, it was passed the Board of Appeals and on its way to the courts so I probably would have done something at that point if I had known,” said Pittman.

Supporters realize there are probably a lot of families out there who don’t have the resources to fight for their dogs the way they did. Even with all the money Cozzone was able to raise for them on a GoFundMe, she paid a lot out of pocket and the attorneys from the Law Office of Ed Middlebrooks put in a lot of time for free.

“We knew it was wrong for these dogs to be put down and so we just decided we’re doing this. We’re gonna fight this case until we win. And I’m so glad we won and got them home,” said Kimbrell.

Kimbrell is now focused on change. She questions how the vicious determination was reached without a sworn statement or testimony from the sole witness to the end of the incident.

“You should not be allowed to put animals to death on an unsigned, unverified, no affidavit and the guy doesn’t even show up to be cross examined,” said Kimbrell.

After seeing media reports about the final appeals hearing, the witness submitted a sworn statement the next day, saying, ""I was working in my garage and I heard dogs barking and I went to check on it and it was two dogs, Odin and Lucy. Odin had Big Boy [the cat] in his mouth and shaking him back and forth and Lucy was biting at my Big Boy's head.""

The family and their attorneys still don’t believe the dogs killed the cat. They believe, because of a continuing problem with coyotes killing cats in the neighborhood, that the dogs happened upon the cat after he was already dead.

“Even if they had, with the history of these dogs, which was zero aggression towards any animal, zero aggression towards any person, to put them down for that to me is just unconscionable, it makes no sense,” said Kimbrell.

Pittman is also concerned about the rigid standards of the law and asked his staff to do a thorough review of this case.

“These laws are written with good intent and they are often written after an incident like what happened in our county, a terrible incident. The goal was to keep dogs that are likely to do these sorts of things again from being back in the community, particularly with irresponsible owners that don’t keep them off the streets, but I think the way this law was written, the potential consequences weren’t fully evaluated and it’s time to go back,” said Pittman.

He plans to bring changes forward in a proposal to the County Council this spring.

“We’re counting on that. We’re counting on it,” said Cozzone.

The family is also concerned about the conditions the dogs were living in. Lucy has raw spots on her elbows, they both are no longer potty trained, and Kimbrell was told by animal control officers that the dogs were not allowed outside.

Anne Arundel County Police said in a statement: “The dogs were permitted to go outside. Also, the dogs were kept in long “runs” which had two sides, one for eating and living and the other for eliminating. The runs were cleaned in accordance with COMAR (Code of Maryland Regulations) standards.

The protocol, as provided by COMAR, requires that “staff will attempt to walk or provide other enrichment to dogs not able to be walked by volunteers” and “Staff and volunteers will strive to interact with animals daily to provide social contact, mental stimulation and physical activity.”

AACACC safely provides care and enrichment for all animals. Safety is always our priority and each animal and its circumstances are different and handled in a manner in which we believe we are balancing animal welfare and safety to the best of our abilities.”

AACo PD said since the 2017 law, about 15 vicious orders have been issued each year, despite around 1,500 investigations per year. In 2018, six dogs were euthanized. In 2019, nine dogs. In 2020, 11 dogs and in 2021, one dog.

They said in a statement that Anne Arundel County has worked hard in recent years to strengthen the laws to hold irresponsible owners accountable because it is recognized that in the wrong hands any animal can create a public safety issue.

“It’s just so important that people take good care of their animals and protect them from getting loose and doing things that their instincts lead them to do. We do have to have these laws to protect the public and other animals,” said Pittman.",Q1
https://www.shockya.com/news/2022/03/14/tom-girardis-former-law-firm-fronted-crime-syndicate-owes-over-500-million-to-creditors/,Tom Girardi’s Former Law Firm-Fronted Crime Syndicate Owes Over $500 Million to Creditors,"The guilt of disgraced former lawyer, Tom Girardi in corrupting the entire California State Legislature through the crime syndicate he’s once ran in L.A. is once again being proved. Court documents obtained by People Magazine last week show that there are 522 claims that have been filed against his now defunct law firm, Girardi & Keese.

The claims against Girardi and his associates amount to over $517 million dollars. The owed money includes $363 million in unsecured claims, $17 million in priority claims, $137 million in secured claims and $250,000 in administrative claims.

The news of the filing comes after Erika Girardi, the estranged wife of the retired attorney, and her company, EJ Global, LLC, were named in a $2.1 million complaint. According to the lawsuit, the ‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’ star allegedly “aided and abetted” her estranged husband in his law firm’s alleged illegal activities. The filing also claims she “knew about the scheme” that he allegedly orchestrated, which involved withholding money intended for clients and co-counsel.

In response to the lawsuit, the reality star’s attorney, Evan C. Borges, said “the complaint is another misguided effort to blame Erika for the conduct of others in which she had no part.”

Erika’s claim of innocence through her attorney comes as the news that her former husband’s network of corrupt lawyers and state bar officials allegedly obtained billions of dollars in insurance fraud surfaced. He also bribed Vice President Kamala Harris when she was Attorney General for California.

For decades, Girardi also relied on judges, many of whom also attended his al-ma-mater, the Loyola School of Law in Hollywood, California, to his advantage, as reported by TV Mix. He fast-tracked those judges, many of who didn’t hold a law degree, through fixed state bar associations, so that they could serve his purposes.

Girardi is also facing trouble for his other illegal activities, which include selling impounded jewels, planes and homes with former L.A. Sheriff Leroy Baca, who’s now serving a jail sentence. He also trafficked the outcomes of trials to the highest bidder with lawyers like Gloria Allred.

Besides Allred, Girardi’s network also includes Judge Michelle Court, who sought counsel from Allred after her husband assaulted her. The professional relationship between the lawyer and her client would have prevented the latter from obtaining entry to the Superior Court of L.A. if Girardi hadn’t illegally helped her career.

Girardi also abused his power by also helping Yolanda Orozco become a judge, after she failed to secure the job on her own. She previously worked as a white collar crime lawyer at Jones Day law firm in L.A. While there, she represented the Sheriff’s office, which was constantly facing charges that ranged from murder to assaults and extortion.

Christopher Wray, the current Director of the FBI, has been tracking Girardi’s crime syndicate for years. Perhaps when his fellow Republicans take back the House and the Senate, they can eradicate the former lawyer’s illegal network, once and for all.",Q1
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-weakness-in-ukraine-russia-conflict-china,Biden's weakness in Ukraine-Russia conflict has only further emboldened China in a new kind of war,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin deserves the world’s unmitigated scorn, but not the United States’ undivided attention. For while Russia today may be an enemy of the West, it is not really a rival. For that, we must look to China.

Putin’s fantasy of resurrecting a greater Russian empire is just that, a fantasy. In reality, Russia is a stale husk of its former self. In the chess game of grand strategy, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not a rook attacking a pawn – it’s a petulant child overturning the board.

BIDEN, XI DISCUSS RUSSIA'S WAR AGAINST UKRAINE AND 'OTHER ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN' IN VIDEO CALL

Yes, the United States must assist Ukraine and our NATO allies to answer Putin’s aggression. And President Biden should do everything in his power to strangle Russia’s energy industry and unleash our own. But talk of this war drawing the United States into a new global conflict misses the point: We’re already in one and have been for years.

It’s one that China started a long time ago. And that conflict is not one the United States should worry about being ""drawn into,"" but one we will either join or lose.

China today is a more dangerous adversary than the Soviet Union at its height. The Chinese Communist Party enjoys strategic advantages Moscow never did, with greater capacity to project power around the world.

Five decades of diplomatic engagement with China, and three of open trade, should leave us with no illusions about the CCP’s ambitions or its ruthless pursuit of them. Like the Soviet Union, the CCP does not care about gauzy abstractions like ""the international community"" or even their own people, as clearly demonstrated by their social credit system and their treatment of religious minorities.

As my colleague Dean Cheng wrote, ""Xi made clear that the PRC won’t tolerate being lectured, nor will it evolve in directions set by others. China has its own ‘core interests,’ which it will not make concessions on — an important point when considering developments ranging from the South China Sea to human rights to cyberspace and outer space to expectations of a more liberal CCP.""

Even more important than what we do to Russia or in Ukraine is what China sees us do.

China is in this fight. The United States still isn’t. And President Biden’s waffling weakness on Ukraine is only further emboldening them. Consider how China has undercut the economic sanctions against the Russian economy through new oil and gas deals. It is past time for the United States to take CCP at its word and treat it like the dangerous strategic rival it is.

How?

Congress and the president can start by finally clarifying our relationship as that of genuine adversaries, not friendly competitors.

All members of the CCP and other Chinese nationals should be barred from national-security-related research funded by federal contracts and grants, as well as from owning land near U.S. national security facilities. Americans should likewise be barred from investing in any firms connected to China’s military or surveillance state.

We should resurrect the China Initiative, the Department of Justice’s highly effective project targeting Chinese espionage that President Biden has just ended. We need to hold the CCP’s leaders and lackeys accountable for their atrocities, from whatever happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2019 to the ethnic cleansing of China’s Uighur minority.

5 CHARGED WITH SPYING FOR CHINA INSIDE US; 3 ARRESTED, 2 AT LARGE

American CEOs, too, should be made personally liable if their businesses knowingly provide technological assistance to Beijing’s human rights abuses. Additionally, Chinese media outlets and official spokesmen should be booted from American social media. Injecting CCP propaganda into America’s domestic political debates represents Big Tech at its worst.

Diplomatically, we need to stop negotiating meaningless climate treaties and nuclear arms control agreements that bind us and our allies, but let China continue to produce carbon and warheads to their hearts’ content. We also must start building a permanent, China-resistant economy via strategic economic disentanglement. That means working with allies to establish strategic stockpiles of critical electronics and the raw, rare-earth minerals they require, new production and manufacturing capacity – especially in critical industries like energy and pharmaceuticals – with the unequivocal goal of cutting China out of U.S. supply chains.

As we strategically withdraw from China, we should strategically embrace Taiwan – diplomatically, economically, and militarily, including selling them as many weapons as they want to buy. This approach is neither an escalation nor a provocation. It’s a realization of both about how we see China and how China sees the world. America has no interest in starting another Cold War, but we have every interest in winning the one Beijing launched against us years ago.

And it is in the context of this new Cold War that we should see all our strategic challenges, including Putin’s war against Ukraine. Even more important than what we do to Russia or in Ukraine is what China sees us do, and whether they look at the United States as a formidable adversary or a declining and irresolute superpower.

For us, whether we like it or not, the most important theater in Putin’s war in Ukraine is neither Kyiv nor Moscow, but Beijing. If Biden doesn’t have the grit and determination to deal with the CCP, then he’ll never be able to deal with Putin.

https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/past-times/3947583/the-fall-of-singapore/,The Fall of Singapore was one of the greatest disasters in British military history,"It was one of the darkest episodes of the Second World War – and hundreds of north-east Scots were among those who suffered the worst privations in the aftermath of the fall of Singapore.

The collapse happened on February 15 1942, when more than 130,000 Allied troops, from Britain, Australia and India, were captured by Japanese forces.

Winston Churchill was appalled when he heard the news and subsequently described the loss of Singapore as “the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history”.

The many Scottish soldiers with the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders were not committed to the battle until it was too late and 40% of their number subsequently died in prison camps: victims of often inhumane treatment at the hands of captors who did not observe the Geneva convention.

The Gordon Highlanders had spent the previous four years in Singapore carrying out vital work, including safeguarding routes to Australia, New Zealand and the rest of the Pacific rim.

They were a redoubtable group, and more than 600 of their number came from within a 50-mile radius of Aberdeen.

But hundreds of these young men suffered excruciating deaths thousands of miles away from home.

Their families had no idea for months and even years afterwards whether they were dead or alive.

And that prompted Mrs Irene Lees, the wife of Major R G Lees, the second-in-command of the Gordon Highlanders, to establish a support group for the many anxious relatives who desperately sought any scrap of information on their loved ones.

They held regular meetings and shared the meagre amount of news coming back from places such as Singapore and Thailand and raised funds to send parcels to the regiment’s prisoners of war, both in the Far East and Germany.

But sadly, although these “goodies” did reach their intended recipients in Europe, the Japanese never distributed any of the goods to their prisoners.

Mrs Lees had lived in Singapore with her husband and was only evacuated on February 12, just 72 hours before the island fell.

She subsequently did her utmost to help anybody with a connection to the Gordon Highlanders, but, in too many cases, was forced to chronicle tragic stories of fallen comrades.

The war in the Pacific had started when the Japanese bombed Singapore on December 8 1941, around the same time as they were attacking Pearl Harbor.

The latter assault took place on December 7 in Hawaii, but it is on the other side of the International Date Line, so it is often misunderstood that these events were virtually simultaneous.

The Japanese then invaded northern Malaya and advanced rapidly down the Malay Peninsula and, by the end of January, Singapore was under threat.

This was an almost unimaginable scenario, considering it had been regarded as an impregnable fortress guarding the vital routes to Australia, New Zealand and the wider Pacific.

But though the Gordons were elite, highly trained soldiers and well acclimatised, they were summoned into the fray too late to halt the rapid momentum that had been built up by their adversaries.

Their role was to defend the artillery positions and the 2nd Battalion was held back from the battle of Malaya until it was almost over: a calamitous misjudgement in many people’s eyes.

They were finally committed to the battle on January 26, just three weeks before the surrender and fought gallantly.

George Clyne died of multiple gunshot wounds when he charged a machine gun post without any thought for his own safety.

The Gordons’ Medical Officer, Captain Frank Pantridge, was awarded a Military Cross for continuing to treat wounded men while subject to continuous bombing and shelling.

Major Walter Duke and Captain Ludovic Farquhar were awarded the same decoration for leadership and bravery in the battle, disregarding their own safety and inspiring their men.

Bandsman Corporal Mark Allen was a stretcher bearer and acted with great heroism as chaos reigned around him.

He organised and led carrying parties for ammunition which he successfully delivered to troops at a critical time.

In addition, he brought back several casualties when machine gun fire and shelling was continuous in the area.

He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, which is second only to the Victoria Cross as a gallantry award to an enlisted man.

And yet, while there was conspicuous courage from so many of the troops, they had been left in an impossible position and thousands of them had to endure grim conditions in PoW camps where many perished from disease, malnutrition or mistreatment by their captives.

There were notable exceptions, such as the case of Alistair Urquhart, from Newtonhill, who somehow survived myriad misfortunes between his incarceration and the end of the global conflict in 1945.

Mr Urquhart, who recorded his remarkable story in the book The Forgotten Highlander, was forced to work as a slave labourer on the notorious Thai-Burma Railway; was later shipwrecked in the South China Sea when his “hellship” was torpedoed; and he was one of a handful of Gordon Highlanders to witness the second atomic bomb cause enormous devastation to Nagasaki.

He died in 2016 in Broughty Ferry at the age of 97 and his heroic resistance in adversity has been celebrated by people such as Stewart Mitchell, a volunteer researcher at the Gordon Highlanders Museum in Aberdeen.

Mr Mitchell, who chronicled their experiences in his poignant book Scattered Under the Rising Sun, said: “It’s beyond our comprehension these days to understand what these men went through.

“As you might expect of the Gordon Highlanders, around 60% of the men were from with 50 miles of Aberdeen, and there are many families in the region from almost every community with a connection to these men.

“That’s why it is so important to preserve their memories, so that future generations can understand the realities of war.

To be honest, many of us hardly knew where Singapore even was before we travelled out there… but so many of these lads are over there forever.” Alistair Urquhart

“We saw three of the last survivors pass away in 2016 – Alistair Urquhart, William Strachan (from Fetterangus), who died in British Columbia, aged 95, and William Bremner (from Turriff), who died in Connecticut, aged 90.

“He enlisted at 15 so he was only 16 when he was captured and sent to the Thai-Burma Railway.

“It must be unlikely that anybody else is still alive after all the years, so these courageous men were the last of their generation.

“We should never forget their sacrifice.”

Mr Urquhart was matter-of-fact in discussing the consequences of the Fall of Singapore.

He always regarded himself as one of the “lucky” ones, who was “blessed” to have been granted the opportunity to return to his homeland and grow old in the company of his family and friends.

But, as he said towards the end of his life: “So many of my pals never came back.

“These were lads who went over there with no idea of how matters would turn out and they had their eyes opened.

“They were young lads from almost every town and village in Moray, Tayside and Aberdeenshire who just wanted to do their duty for their country.

“To be honest, many of us hardly knew where Singapore even was before we travelled out there… but so many of these lads are over there forever.”

Their names may not be widely known but, on the 80th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore, they deserve to be commemorated.",Q1

https://kdhlradio.com/minnesota-moose-dying/,What Is Causing Moose In Northern Minnesota To Be Dying Off At An Alarming Rate?,"To see a moose in the wild is a rare and awesome experience to behold. I could not even imagine how cool that would be. The closest I have come to see one in the wild is when that bull moose was hanging around the grounds at Lester River in Duluth a few years ago.

But these beautiful animals are being threatened to survive in Northern Minnesota based on a number of factors. According to Vox.com ""moose are disappearing from northeast Minnesota, where it’s estimated they once numbered over 10,000. Since 2006, the population in the state has fallen by 64 percent.""

Seth Moore, who is a biologist says that the decline in the moose population is related directly to climate change. Starting back in 2010 Moore and his team took to the skies via helicopters in order to try and see wild moose since they are so hard to find and cover a huge area, so this is the easiest way to spot them.

Initially, they figured it was the gray wolf causing the decline in the moose population which was to a degree because they realized that these wolves were killing 8 out of 10 moose calves in the spring. But this did not explain what was killing adult moose.

""Over the course of a decade, the researchers outfitted more than 160 adult moose with GPS collars to track their movements and activity level. If a moose stops moving for more than six hours, Moore gets a text alert with the animal’s location. We’ll put together a team and head out, sometimes miles into the woods, when we get there, typically, we’ll find a dead moose.”

Moore and his team would then take blood and tissue samples and after three years of data, they were able to come up with what was killing these adult moose. It was from a 3-inch parasitic brain worm that has come into Northeastern Minnesota from whitetail deer. In the past whitetail deer were not seen in the same areas as the moose, but due to warmer winters and less snow, the deer have migrated into the same areas. It is quite the process of how this parasite gets into the moose.

The brain worms eventually hatch and are found in deer feces where snails and slugs consume the deer droppings. These snails and slugs climb trees and shrubs which are then consumed by the adult moose. These worms then cause neurological damage where the moose become dizzy, disoriented, and die of starvation or hypothermia.

Another reason for the drop in moose population is ticks caused by the warmer winters. Some moose that they have found is covered in hundreds of ticks. These poor moose will scratch themselves raw up against trees and lose a majority of their fur causing hypothermia which eventually kills them.

Climate change is real and is affecting all aspects of our planet and wildlife. What a shame that these beautiful animals are dying off at such an alarming rate. But maybe with this type of research results, something can be done in the future to protect this species from becoming extinct.

https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/01/shakespearean-donald-trump-to-be-subject-of-play-in-blank-verse,‘Shakespearean’ Donald Trump to be subject of play in blank verse,"The author of an acclaimed play about the future of the monarchy has taken on the “Shakespearean” figure of Donald Trump and his battle to regain the White House in 2024 in a new work in blank verse.

“I never thought I would go back to writing Shakespearean form again, but then I had an instinct that Trump is like a Shakespearean king, so it felt like a match,” said playwright Mike Bartlett, whose acclaimed King Charles III focused on a power struggle and constitutional crisis following the death of the Queen.

Bertie Carvel, who plays Tony Blair in the next season of The Crown, takes the part of Trump in The 47th, which opens at the Old Vic in March. “For me, he was the obvious choice,” said Bartlett, who previously worked with Carvel on the television drama Dr Foster.

The 47th imagines Trump’s bid to win the 2024 US presidential election and his opponents’ efforts to defeat him and rightwing populism. “Can it be defeated? And, on the other hand, what is the appeal of the thing Trump offers – which is clearly huge?” said Bartlett.

The play was intended “to interrogate where America is now, and where it’s headed” while entertaining audiences. “One of the appeals of the Shakespearean form is it can move tone between something that’s very witty and very funny, and something that’s deadly serious – and it can do that within a paragraph.”

Bartlett added: “It was a joy writing Trump in Shakespearean form. He lends himself to that beautifully, he just writes himself. He’s hilarious, and devastating. And this has opened my eyes to exactly what his rhetorical tactics are, where his wit is, where he’s intelligent, and where he’s not intelligent.”

The 47th is directed by Rupert Goold, who also directed the Olivier award-winning King Charles III, which premiered in 2014 and later became a TV film. It too was written in blank verse – also known as unrhymed iambic pentameter – in common with many Shakespeare plays.

Richard Goulding, who played Prince Harry in both play and film, said in 2017: “This blank verse form heightens all the exchanges and it makes things much more operatic, much more dramatic, and everything much more significant … It’s all about the rhythms and the way the language is used.”

Bartlett said his inspiration for The 47th stemmed from Trump denying the results of the 2020 election, and “seeing that the assaults on the Capitol and feeling the country was headed towards potential civil violence. Suddenly that power struggle is the story.”

He added: “I feel like I have the absolute right to do this, given the political power, the sway [these people] have over every single person’s life. This is what theatre should be doing – looking at these figures, looking at what motivates them, asking what can they do, what the future is going to be.

“A great play will ask existential questions. What are our ambitions? How good are we? Why are we fascinated by Trump? Do we have a devil in all of us? And does the devil have the best tunes?”

Carvel, he said, was “all-in as an actor. He fully embodies the character and he’s totally fearless to present someone on stage that you might not like at all.” Whether Miss Trunchbull in Matilda the Musical, Simon Foster in Dr Foster, or Rupert Murdoch in Ink, “these are not people that are well liked.

“He just has a complete pursuit of the truth of the story and the character. And to play Trump, you absolutely want someone that has that intimidation about them that Trump has in real life.”",Q1

SALEM, Ore. — The Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Wednesday it has fined Dollar Tree Stores Inc. $32,000 for repeatedly exposing employees to potential serious injury.

The violation was reported at the the chain's Wilsonville store at 29756 Town Center Loop West.

The potential for serious injury was from unsecured materials falling, tripping and falling in cramped aisles and inaccessible fire extinguishers and emergency exits, the Oregon Department of Consumer & Business Services said in a news release.

The $32,000 fine was issued after an inspection of the Wilsonville site that began in late 2021 and wrapped up in February, prompted by a complaint that OSHA received last year.

The size of the fine reflects the fact that four of the five identified violations were repeats of violations cited previously at other Oregon Dollar Tree locations, OSHA said.

""The workplace safety and health standards enforced by Oregon OSHA are there for a reason, so that employers have clear and time-tested steps to follow to keep workers out of harm’s way,"" Lou Savage, interim administrator for the division, said in a statement. ""Failing to follow them is not an option. Repeatedly failing to follow them serves only one purpose: to deepen the risk of severe injury and suffering.""",Q1

https://www.military.com/history/cathay-williams-was-armys-only-female-buffalo-soldier-and-first-black-female-enlistee.html,Cathay Williams Was the Army's Only Female Buffalo Soldier and First Black Female Enlistee,"William Cathay enlisted in the U.S. Army on Nov. 15, 1866, for a three-year term. Since the Army didn't do full physical examinations during this period, it would allow Cathay to serve out most of the contract, even though William Cathay was actually Cathay Williams, a woman posing as a man. But her service started long before she was old enough to enlist.

She would end her Army career as the Army's only female Buffalo Soldier and first Black woman to enlist.

She was born in 1844 in Missouri to a free father and an enslaved woman, which made her legally a slave. When the Union Army captured Jefferson City, slaves were considered ""contraband"" so Cathay Williams and slaves like her supported the Union Army as camp followers. She and others cooked for the troops, cleaned their laundry or acted as nurses.

According to stories told by Williams after her enlistment and discharge, she followed the Union Army throughout the west and was present for many of its most important engagements, including the Siege of Vicksburg and Gen. William T. Sherman's March to the Sea.

She had begun supporting the Union Army at age 17. By the time the war ended, she was 22 years old, but the Army was all she'd known as an adult. With the Civil War over and slaves across the country freed, she enlisted in the Army, posing as William Cathay and was sent to the 38th U.S. Infantry Regiment.

The unit was organized in 1866 as one of six segregated Black infantry regiments, which became collectively known as ""Buffalo Soldiers."" They were the first all-Black infantry regiments of the regular Army formed during peacetime.

The 38th's primary mission was protecting the construction of the intercontinental railroads, the first of which was completed in 1869, when the 38th merged with the 41st Infantry Regiment. The 41st was also a segregated unit, which had spent the time in Louisiana and Texas.

The only thing that kept Williams from completing her enlistment was a disease that would be eliminated in the United States 20 years later: smallpox. She contracted the virus not long after signing up for the Army. After recovering, she rejoined the 38th, which was then in New Mexico for the railroads' east-west continental connection.

After she suffered years of stress on her body, frequent hospitalizations and never fully recovered from her smallpox infection, Army doctors finally took a closer look at William Cathay and discovered the truth. She was honorably discharged in 1868 and moved to Fort Union, New Mexico, where she went to work as a cook.

The Buffalo Soldiers went on to fight in the Indian Wars of the American West and the Spanish-American War. Cathay Williams moved to Colorado. She became a seamstress as her story remained untold in the wider press for almost a decade. In 1874, a reporter from the St. Louis Daily Times heard rumors of a Black woman who had served in and was honorably discharged from the Army and published an account two years later.

Williams' medical troubles followed her for the rest of her life. She was known to have suffered from neuralgia (pain along certain nerves) and diabetes (from which she lost all her toes), but her applications for medical pensions from the Army were denied. No one knows precisely when or where she died or at what age.

The Global Association of Buffalo Soldiers Recognition and Riding Club Inc. finally recognized Williams' historic service after almost 150 years. In 2015, it unveiled a monument bench for Pvt. Cathay Williams on the Walk of Honor at the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia.

BOULDER, Colo. — A wind-swept wildfire that tore through suburban neighborhoods between Denver and Boulder on Thursday, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people, may have destroyed between 500 and 1,000 homes, the authorities said Friday morning, making it the most destructive blaze in state history.

The fire, as intense as it was sudden, sent tens of thousands of residents of Boulder County scrambling to leave department stores and houses on Thursday as fire trucks swarmed the area. Though wildfires are seen as less of a threat in suburban areas, especially in December, a period of intense drought had created the conditions for the flames to spread, destroying houses, a shopping complex and a hotel.

“It felt like the apocalypse,” said Ruthie Werner, a resident of Louisville, Colo., who had gone to shop at a Target store but arrived to find the parking lot ablaze.

Gov. Jared Polis said at a news briefing that President Biden had approved an expedited major disaster declaration, which allows those who lost their homes or small business to get assistance before the preliminary damage assessment is done. He said schools and major hospitals in the area were spared.

As Mr. Polis toured the damage by helicopter on Friday, video published by a local television station showed how the flames had struck seemingly at random. One house on a cul-de-sac would be destroyed, while the others looked to be intact. In one neighborhood, a line of about 10 still-smoldering rubble piles was next to other houses that had appeared to escape severe damage.

Despite the destruction, no deaths had been recorded, a figure that Mr. Polis said at the news conference would be a “New Year’s miracle” if it held.

“It wasn’t a wildfire in the forest, it was a suburban and urban fire,” said Mr. Polis, a Democrat who lives in Boulder County. “The Costco we all shop at, the Target we buy our kids’ clothes at — all damaged.”

The fire, which began late Thursday morning, burned in a “mosaic” fashion, encouraged by 105 mile-an-hour winds. It torched about 6,000 acres, said Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County, who added that damage assessments were still being done on Friday. The authorities suspect the fire was caused by a downed power line, but that has not been confirmed, he said.

Much of the fire has been contained, with only a few parts of Boulder County still smoldering, he said. Heavy snowfall was in the forecast for Friday, which would help tamp down the fire but could also lead to freezing pipes, officials said.

Louisville and Superior, both about nine miles east of Boulder, suffered the most “catastrophic” losses, he said. Residents of those cities were ordered to evacuate on Thursday, along with residents of nearby Broomfield and Westminster.

While there was no immediate official count of how many people were ultimately displaced, an estimated 200 people are currently staying at emergency shelters in the county, Mr. Polis said.

Evacuees fled the fire zones under plumes of smoke that clouded the sky for miles on Thursday, not knowing if their houses would make it through the night. Roads and highways in the Denver metro area were jammed with thousands of residents trying to flee.

“It took us almost an hour to get out of our neighborhood — it was complete gridlock,” said John Stein, who was walking his dog in Superior when he saw smoke in the area and heard sirens.

Thomas Maxwell, 25, said he did not know on Thursday if his parents’ house in Louisville was still standing. Mr. Maxwell, who lives in California, had been dog-sitting for them while they vacationed in Spain. He woke them with a midnight call to say that he had evacuated to a hotel with their two dogs.

“It was crazy how fast it happened,” Maxwell said. “I read about wildfires in California all the time. Now I’m experiencing it. It’s so different.”

Wildfires in the American West have been worsening — growing larger, spreading faster and reaching into mountainous elevations that were once too wet and cool to have supported fierce fires. What was once a seasonal phenomenon has become a year-round menace, with fires burning later into the fall and into the winter.

Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires, as rainfall patterns have been disrupted, snow melts earlier and meadows and forests are scorched into kindling.

Colorado had the three largest wildfires in its history in the summer of 2020, each one burning more than 200,000 acres, Mr. Polis said. But those fires burned federally owned forests and land, he said, while the fires on Thursday destroyed suburban developments and shopping plazas.

“As a millennial, I’m just looking outside and I’m seeing climate change,” said Angelica Kalika, 36, of Broomfield. “I’m seeing my future. I grew up in Colorado, and this is a place where I’ve had snowy Christmases and a nice 60-degree summer. But, for me, this is a moment of deep reckoning of climate change when there is a wildfire outside my door.”",Q1

According to the Arkansas State Police, husband David Sawyer Claborn, 25, wife Meredith Claborn, 24, and their 23-month-old daughter Sadie Dawn Claborn were first discovered dead inside their home on early Sunday afternoon by unidentified relatives.

There is presently no indication how the family died or who the believed-to-be assailant was among the two adults.

State police are currently investigating the circumstances of the slayings at the request of the Pike County Sheriff’s Department, according to a news release from the agency.

Each of the three bodies were recently transported to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory in order to determine the specific manner and cause of death. No indication on what killed any of the deceased has been made public at this time.

“At this juncture in their investigation, Special Agents of the Arkansas State Police Criminal Investigation have no evidence to lead them to search for a suspect in the deaths,” that news release noted.

Law&Crime reached out to the ASP for additional information on the case but no response was immediately forthcoming at the time of publication.

According to local NBC affiliate KARK, Pike County Sheriff Travis Hill said the incident appears to be isolated.

The incident occurred in Glenwood, Ark., some 75 miles south-southwest of Little Rock. Glenwood Mayor Billy Smith told the outlet that such violence is rare in his “tight-knit community” where “everyone knows everyone else,” especially for a family who was known to be particularly active in the area’s recreation industry.

The mayor went on to say that residents of the small town were shocked by the news but are rallying the best way they can by sending letters of condolences to relatives of the deceased.

“It just reaches up and grabs your heart,” Smith told KARK. “It’s something no one should have to deal with.”

Law enforcement in the tiny town of some 2,100 people are also not used to dealing with such violence and tragedy.

“This kept me awake,” Glenwood Police Chief Clark Kinzler told KARK. “All that really matters is just making sure you find out what happened and what the truth is. We owe this to our victims, and we owe this to our families.”

While three people dead on quiet Baker Road has roiled Glenwood, the broader Natural State is unfortunately no stranger to murder-suicides as of late.

The Glenwood massacre is at least the second such incident in the state this year alone. A murder-suicide reportedly occurred in Miller County, Ark., near the city of Texarkana, over the weekend as well. A man and his wife were found dead, from single gunshot wounds, inside of their truck in that incident.

And, as the weather chilled and 2021 drew to a close, at least one murder-suicide was documented in Arkansas in October, November and December. Numerous murder-suicides have occurred across the country over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

ECTOR, Texas — Two people were killed in a fatal crash on January 22 in Ector County.

40-year-old Jeannie Corralez of Fort Stockton and 21-year-old Mia Hermosillo of Odessa were killed in the accident at Farm Market 3472.

The initial investigation revealed that Corralez and the driver of a 2017 Dodge Charger, 39-year-old Enrique Enriquez, were traveling westbound on FM 3472, while Hermosillo, driving a 2014 Dodge Charger, was traveling eastbound on FM 3472. Enriquez eventually crossed into the eastbound land and hit the front of Hermosillo's vehicle.

Enriquez was taken to Medical Center Hospital in Serious Condition. Hermosillo and Corralez were pronounced dead by Medical Examiner Bodwell.

According to DPS, evidence of Enriquez being intoxicated was found. He has now been charged with intoxication manslaughter.",Q1

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

Today when we reached Lisa Desjardins of the PBS NewsHour, she was, let's say, multitasking.

LISA DESJARDINS: I'm so sorry. This is actually crazy. I have a good excuse. First of all...

CORNISH: And she had a really good excuse. Nearly a year ago, she was reporting live from the U.S. Capitol as rioters entered the building.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DESJARDINS: That protestor has now opened the front door of the Capitol to let his fellow protestors in. There is a single Capitol Police officer.

There were two rioters that followed me on January 6, and DOJ - their sentencing hearing is right now.

CORNISH: Lisa Desjardins was actually trying to listen to that hearing, where, by the way, they were sentenced to 30 days in prison after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges.

DESJARDINS: I exchanged words with them at some point, but I don't remember what they were. It was all a haze. And there were a lot of rioters that were talking to me or saying things to me or shouting at me. And I used a variety of things I would say to them to kind of try and calm things down, make sure they wouldn't come after me.

CORNISH: Sarah Ferris of Politico had a different experience. She was inside the House of Representatives chamber, where lawmakers were crouched on the floor of the gallery. And she remembers them praying, fearing for their lives.

SARAH FERRIS: That was the moment when I realized that people were going to die that day.

CORNISH: Ferris has been in touch with those representatives since, and she says that day changed them.

FERRIS: A lot of them are engaged in this giant group text, where they trade support tips. They trade therapy. They're talking about getting together and doing potlucks. And, I mean, this has truly become a bond for the group.

CORNISH: Now, we actually spoke with congressional reporters Sarah Ferris and Lisa Desjardins a few days after the violence at the Capitol. Now, nearly a year later, we've called them up again to see how the events of January 6 have lingered for the people who work in Congress. There was such anger immediately after that day, especially from Democrats angry that GOP rhetoric had endangered their lives. I asked Desjardins if tensions in Congress had gotten any better since then.

DESJARDINS: I really thought that all of those raw feelings, which we saw grow and become more raw - February, March, even - I thought there would be a point in the summer where the Democrats who couldn't even look at a fellow member of Congress who was a Republican without feeling just raw anger - that that would subside. But I was very surprised that it really didn't subside all through the summer into the fall. I think people have taken a little bit of a breath just this last two weeks that I haven't felt for the rest of the year. But that said, underneath it all, those raw emotions are just as present. And for some of them, they're - they've been growing.

CORNISH: Lisa, I want to stay with you for a minute. Do lawmakers even fundamentally agree about the severity and significance of January 6? - Because I think to the public, you're watching Republicans block the creation of that independent commission to investigate what happened. So few are cooperating with the House select committee's investigation. Are we looking at just party politics, or is there actually a disagreement on what happened?

DESJARDINS: I think the simple answer is they do not agree about what happened. But it really is a little more complicated because there are a lot of politics involved. I think we will see both parties bringing up aspects of January 6 in their runs to the midterm, Republicans accusing Democrats of being political about it and, of course, Democrats saying that Republicans are extreme and that they are a problem, a danger for democracy. But I think that there - the truth of it is that there are a large group of Republicans who believe it was a dangerous day and who will tell you that off record. And they will say something different on record. And that leads to a very complicated situation for public dialogue and for members of Congress themselves to sort out the day. Most members - most Republicans and Democrats will say that the day was dangerous; it was a problem; violence is bad. They will say those three things. But then you get into the deeper context about what it means and who is to blame. And there, you have a real divide. And some of it is just political, not real divide.

CORNISH: Sarah, I want to ask you about what the building has been like in this last year since the riot. We know in those following weeks, there was so much security around the Capitol. What is the normal today when it comes to security and being in the building?

FERRIS: It certainly doesn't feel like there is a normal. Of course, we're still dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, which has really just hit another surge in the Capitol in the last couple of weeks. So the building on January 6 itself will be empty, not just because the House technically isn't in session but because so many staff - hundreds, if not thousands of staff - have been told to work from home because of this new variant. And - but even in the weeks and months before that, the Capitol never was as full as it was before the pandemic. Anybody who was in the building that day, anybody who was in or near the chamber, even folks who weren't, who were watching their workplace be desecrated from afar, the mental aspect of this has been really intense and has changed the building in a lot of ways and not just staffers - members, too. I've talked to many Democratic members who say January 6 was a reason that they are retiring, and that's just the truth.

CORNISH: What are you two going to be watching going forward? Obviously, there are cases that are still moving through the courts. But it's also now heading into midterm elections, and I'm sure that could really kind of shift where this particular story goes. Lisa, can we start with you?

DESJARDINS: I'm really worried about the us-versus-them factor right now because I don't see anyone emerging to get us out of that. I see both sides. And I'm not saying that both sides are equal. You know, they're not. However, I think that those on the right who are trying to justify January 6, trying to whitewash it, you know, they are trying to justify that by saying that they are under attack. But on the left, they, I think, understandably, don't want to engage with people they feel attacked them. So when does engagement come? Where do the temperatures start to go down? When do average Americans in the middle of this country - can they have a conversation where they don't look at each other based on how they voted in 2020 or 2016 because it's going the other way? And I think there's also too much reward for politicians who say and do extreme things. And there's just not a conversation about anyone having done anything wrong. There's - everyone's locking into the idea that they are right, the other side is wrong, and it worries me.

CORNISH: Sarah Ferris, last word to you.

FERRIS: I think about what could happen on January 6, 2023. It's almost certain that the Republicans will be taking back control of the House, and a lot of Democratic members told me they wanted to set a really important historical example on January 6, 2022, as the year mark, with somber testimony and memorials. And they tell me, 2023 they don't think is going to look that way. They're afraid that Republican leadership will try to brush over this, gloss over this, pivot back to - why weren't the Democrats in charge of the security preventing this? - and making it about security lapses by Democrats, who'd been in control of Congress, versus what actually happened and versus making sure that this sort of extreme behavior doesn't happen among their supporters. And so that's what a lot of Democrats - that's what - that's on their minds - is as this anniversary comes, they're looking ahead to the next one, when Republicans will be in charge and whether or not they can figure out a message about what exactly happened that day in a unifying way.

CORNISH: That's Sarah Ferris from Politico and, from PBS NewsHour, Lisa Desjardins. Thank you both for speaking with us.

FERRIS: Thanks for having us.

DESJARDINS: You're welcome.

https://americanfreepress.net/judge-strikes-down-indefinite-detention-obama-appeals/,"Judge Strikes Down Indefinite Detention, Obama Appeals – American Free Press","By Pete Papaherakles

On September 12, civil liberties advocates sighed in relief as U.S. Judge Katherine Forrest permanently struck down indefinite detention provisions of the notorious National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This blatant violation of Americans’ constitutional liberties is law no more, although an appeal is still possible.







Judge Forrest ruled that the law was unconstitutional. “First Amendment rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and cannot be legislated away,” the judge wrote. “This court rejects the government’s suggestion that American citizens can be placed in military detention indefinitely for acts they could not predict might subject them to detention.”

According to an article in RT, “Only hours after Judge Forrest issued last week’s ruling, the Obama administration threatened to appeal the decision, and on Monday morning they followed through. At around 9 a.m. Monday, September 17, the White House filed an emergency stay in federal appeals court in an effort to have the Second Circuit strip away Judge Forrest’s ruling from the week earlier.”

Section 1021 of the NDAA, which contained the controversial provisions, would have allowed for indefinitely detaining U.S citizens without the right of habeas corpus. This right is so fundamental to the Constitution that it was one of the main causes for the American War of Independence. Habeas corpus, which translates as “you shall have the body,” states that an accused person must be physically brought before a judge with a statement demonstrating sufficient cause for arrest.

The Continental Congress held King George III accountable for his failure to enforce this basic human right. Yet in 2012 our own government saw fit to deprive its own citizens of this same right in the name of fighting terrorism. By redefining what a terrorist is, the Department of Homeland Security would have potentially been able to indefinitely detain any American without formally charging him of a specific crime.

The NDAA had been challenged earlier this year by journalists, scholars and political activists including Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsberg and Naomi Wolf. A temporary injunction had already been placed on the provision by Judge Forrest in May. Hedges, a Pulitzer prize winner and former New York Times war correspondent, led the challenge with a lawsuit against the bill in January. The plaintiffs testified in court that they had no assurance that their writing and advocacy activities could not be deemed “terrorism.”









The provision subjected to indefinite detention anyone who “substantially” or “directly” provided “support” to terrorists. Judge Forrest questioned how “substantial support” can be determined. “That’s no small question” she said. “It’s a question about defining an individual’s core liberties.”

She questioned the criteria and the methods the government would use to determine if an article or video posted to the Internet “substantially supported” the terrorists or even how to distinguish between “modest” and “substantial” support.

“In short, the court can find no authority in domestic law or the law of war, nor can the government point to any, to justify the concept of ‘support’ as a valid ground for detention” she said.

Plaintiffs’ lawyer Bruce Afran called the ruling “historic” and said it was rare in the last half century that a judge would declare a federal statute unconstitutional for directly intruding on speech.

https://freebeacon.com/democrats/house-democrats-sneak-pro-union-measure-into-anti-china-bill/,House Democrats Sneak Pro-Union Measure Into Anti-China Bill,"House Democrats on Tuesday tucked an amendment into a bill aimed at helping American businesses compete with China that would bolster unionization efforts at manufacturers that receive government grants.

The amendment, proposed by Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D., Texas), would require private manufacturers to have a unionized workforce to receive grants through the America COMPETES Act. A majority of workers at each manufacturer would be required to sign on to a petition to certify unionization to be eligible. This practice—known as ""card check union organizing""—forces employees to publicly declare whether or not they want to unionize. Current regulations require unions to be established through a secret ballot, giving workers protection from intimidation efforts.

Critics say the amendment undermines worker protections.

""It is unfortunate that some in Congress continue to attack the rights of workers to a secret ballot election,"" Vinnie Vernuccio, president of the Institute for the American Worker, told the Washington Free Beacon. ""The updated version of the America COMPETES Act is just the latest in a long list of attempts to favor union organizing over what workers actually want and their privacy.""

Democrats have long pushed for card checks, also referred to as ""majority sign-up,"" because they say the process simplifies the union certification process for workers. Democrats failed during the Obama administration to establish a permanent card check through the Employee Free Choice Act. Some Democrats debated a similar push for card checks in the latest version of the PRO Act, a pro-union bill backed by the Biden administration, but decided against including the measure in the bill.

Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

Labor unions and their affiliated PACs spent $70 million on backing Democrats during the 2020 election cycle—more than seven times the amount they spent on Republicans. Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Committee, said card checks are intended to maximize union influence across the country.

""Once again we are reminded that the recipients of union campaign contributions will throw the rights of actual workers under the bus just to expand the power of big labor bosses,"" Mix told the Free Beacon.

The amendment was adopted Wednesday night and the bill is expected to pass along party lines Friday.",Q1

BROOKHAVEN, MS — A Black FedEx driver and his attorney called for justice this week a month after he said two white men shot at him while chasing him through a Mississippi neighborhood.

Gregory Case, 58, and his son, Brandon Case, 35, were arrested in January for after being accused of chasing and shooting at 24-year-old Demonterrio Gibson. The incident reportedly happened when Gibson, a FedEx driver, was dropping off a package. At a news conference Thursday, Gibson's attorneys called for a federal hate crimes probe of the attempted shooting, saying it's another example of Black Americans facing danger simply for going about their daily activities.

""This man is fully, gainfully employed by FedEx, doing his job, and still you haul off and try to chase him and cut him off and shoot him multiple times and kill him. It’s sickening to be that hateful and that racist and that full of just malice just because of the color of his skin,"" said Gibson's attorney, Carlos Moore. ""He was simply Black while working,"" Moore continued.

In an interview with CNN, Gibson said he was delivering packages around 7 p.m. on Jan. 24 when a white pickup truck began following him. Gibson told CNN he was driving a Hertz rental van. Moore, Gibson's attorney, told CNN that Gibson was wearing a FedEx jacket, shirt and pants but that the van had no FedEx markings.

Police told WJTV that Gregory and Brandon Case were in the pickup truck and, according to investigators, Brandon Case repeatedly fired shots at the truck. Police told the news station the two men pursued the truck until it reached Interstate 55. Gregory Case and Brandon Case later turned themselves in to police, the Daily Leader reported.

Gregory Case was charged with conspiracy, while Brandon Case was charged with shooting into a motor vehicle, WJTV reported. On Thursday, Gibson said he was told to return to work as well as the same route the following day, according to WJTV. Gibson said he worked for a day or two before he started having ""bad anxiety attacks."" Jim Masilak, manager of media relations for FedEx, provided a statement in response to questions from The Associated Press on Thursday: ""FedEx takes situations of this nature very seriously, and we are shocked by this criminal act against our team member. ... The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we remain focused on his wellbeing. We will continue to support Mr. Gibson as we cooperate with investigating authorities.""

https://www.circleofblue.org/2022/wef/arizonas-future-water-shock/,Arizona’s Future Water Shock,"Acting on Future Scenario



The response by state leaders to the 2014 study has been methodical but by no means urgent. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey formed expert committees. Finding more water is their most popular option. Last year, Ducey convinced the Legislature to invest $160 million to investigate “augmentation,” which is Arizona’s term for developing new sources of water.

This year, the governor proposed establishing a new state agency, the Arizona Water Authority, to pursue new supplies and also asked the Legislature for $1 billion more, framing the request around the need to build a desalination plant, perhaps in Mexican waters, to produce 250,000 acre-feet a year.

Other ideas for securing Arizona’s water supply — regulating groundwater use in rural areas, metering private water wells, increasing use of recycled wastewater, restricting natural grass lawns, and imposing land use and urban design requirements to collect and store stormwater — haven’t reached nearly the same level of clarity and legislative purpose.

There’s a reason for that. Regulatory changes in water policy and practice are some of the steepest cliffs in Arizona’s political landscape. Any proposal judged by lawmakers to challenge property rights, raise costs, and impede growth is dead on arrival in the Legislature. Such proposals generate powerful winds of opposition in the executive offices of home builders, chambers of commerce, and every other economic development agency.

Arizona’s leaders and communities vow to continue growing. One prominent example is Buckeye, a suburb in the desert west of Phoenix that is one of the country’s fastest growing cities. Buckeye supplies over 11,000 acre-feet of water annually to its 97,000 residents and businesses, according to city figures.

Buckeye has enough land — and its current leaders sufficient moxie — to welcome 900,000 more residents by mid-century. At current rates of water consumption, Buckeye would need over 100,000 acre-feet annually, or 90,000 acre-feet more water than today.

Where will it come from? The city’s latest master water plan includes a lengthy list of potential water sources that are either unreliable (Colorado River), difficult to secure and transport, and certainly more expensive.

One idea, for example, is to help finance construction that will raise the height of 83-year-old Bartlett Dam, located east of Phoenix, to add 130,000 acre-feet to Bartlett Lake’s storage capacity. Whatever portion of the added supply that Buckeye gains would then be transported to the city over 100 miles through existing canals.

Another idea is to build a treatment plant to remove salts and impurities from a brackish aquifer within the city limits to use as water for landscaping, and maybe for drinking water.

Two more ideas involve purchasing groundwater from basins distant from Buckeye and transporting it by pipe and the Central Arizona Project (CAP) aqueduct to the city. Sounds simple in concept. In real-life application it’s not. The administrative challenges, water leasing contracts, and infrastructure requirements are costly and tricky.

One of those sources is the Harquahala groundwater basin beneath the desert further west of Buckeye, in Maricopa County. The state says it holds a total of 15.5 million acre-feet, though not nearly all of that can be recovered. If Buckeye relies on the Harquahala basin for most of the 90,000 acre-feet it will need, that represents perhaps a 50-year supply. Existing state law requires subdivision builders in Buckeye to assure they have a 100-year supply of water before they can begin construction. Harquahala, in effect, helps a bit in meeting that requirement. Buckeye needs more than Harquahala for its new sources of water.

Second, transporting groundwater out of the Harquahala basin to Buckeye involves 1) building a 30-mile long pipeline, 2) transporting water via the Central Arizona Project (CAP) canal, and 3) paying a fortune for the water.

The first obstacle likely requires a formal environmental assessment, or a more complex environmental impact statement required for state, and perhaps the federal government’s review and approval.

Transporting water in the CAP is similarly complex. It involves review and approval by the director of the Department of Water Resources and the U.S. secretary of the Interior. Following those approvals, Buckeye would need to negotiate and sign a wheeling contract approved by the federal Bureau of Reclamation and the leadership board that oversees the CAP.

The third element, actually gaining access to Harquahala groundwater, significantly raises the cost of water in Buckeye. Buyers seeking a long-term lease for Harquahala water told Circle of Blue that the current price quote is a one-time fee of $7,000 to $10,000 an acre foot, or somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion.

When asked whether Buckeye will have sufficient supplies of water to meet the demand of 1 million residents, Annie DeChance, the city’s communications manager, did not hesitate. “Absolutely,” she replied. “We have the water we need. We are aware of the complexities and challenges.”",Q1
https://www.centralmaine.com/2022/03/22/legislators-may-ban-most-secret-settlements-in-cases-brought-by-employees/,Legislators may ban most secret settlements in cases brought by employees,"Lawmakers plan to renew discussion this week of a hotly disputed, #MeToo-inspired measure that would prohibit most nondisclosure agreements in employment.

“At its core, this bill, if enacted, would prevent employers from forcing prospective employees to waive their rights to ever discuss or make known their experiences regarding harassment in the workplace,” said Rep. Thom Harnett, the Gardiner Democrat who sponsored it.

“No person should ever be placed in the position of having to give up the fundamental right to speak out about workplace harassment and discrimination in order to get or keep a job,” Harnett told colleagues during a public hearing last spring.

Opponents said, however, that nondisclosure deals are useful in settling matters without any admission of guilt and barring them would be counterproductive.

The Maine State Chamber of Commerce said in its testimony that the bill “is predicated on the assumption that nondisclosure agreements are problematic: hiding and therefore implicitly encouraging bad behavior,” which it doubts is a major problem in the state.

The Legislature’s joint Labor and Housing Committee plans a work session Friday to dive into the details and decide whether to endorse the bill again this year as it did last May. If it does, the Legislature could approve it in the coming weeks.

Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby, urged lawmakers to back it.

Discrimination and harassment are issues of gender equity and required nondisclosure agreements have too often been used to reinforce power differentials that many workers experience while protecting those who cause harm,” she said.

Kristin Aiello, senior attorney at Disability Rights Maine, said allowing mandatory nondisclosure agreements “means that nearly every civil rights case that is privately settled comes with a muzzle, which has an impact not only on the individual but on greater public policy.”

The flip side of the debate is that forcing every settlement into public view may be unfair to some.

Stephen Gorden, president of the Maine County Commissioners Association, testified that cases are sometimes settled because it’s not worth the time and money to litigate them. Making them public could spread “false allegations” around.

Gorden also said that “settlements are much less likely if the parties cannot mutually agree to cease making further accusations about workplace activities. And, without such ability to mutually settle a case, we should expect more litigation, more costs and more negative impacts on taxpayers.”

It’s a stance that echoes what the Maine Department of Labor told the committee.

“Nondisclosure provisions are not inherently contrary to public policy,” it said, “and can serve legitimate purposes in particular cases.”

The department’s testimony said that without the ability to impose nondisclosure terms that block “making public unflattering or sensitive information,” settling cases will get harder.

“On balance we believe the public interest is better served by preserving the option of nondisclosure provisions rather than legislatively restricting the terms and conditions upon which parties can resolve employment disputes,” Michael Roland, director of the department’s Bureau of Labor Standards, testified.

Attorney Jeffrey Neil Young, who practices in Cumberland, said the Maine Employment Lawyers Association favors the bill.

Young told legislators that mandatory nondisclosure agreements “have proliferated in recent years” and have “served to protect serial sexual harassment perpetrators like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby from discovery of their pernicious and predatory behavior.”

The agreements “shield employers from liability or increased liability in the case of serial harassing and discriminatory conduct, allowing such wanton conduct to continue.”

Publicity, Young said, can help “survivors of harassment and discrimination” and “help provide closure” for them.

The Maine Education Association, which represents many of the state’s teachers, said it backs the measure “in order to provide notice to employers that they can no longer hide behind onerous nondisclosure terms, which are intended to pressure employees to stay silent in matters concerning allegations of harassment and discrimination.”

The National Women’s Law Center said that since 2018, at least 15 states, “have enacted legislation limiting or prohibiting employers from requiring employees to sign nondisclosure agreements as a condition of employment or as part of a settlement agreement.”

A work session on the measure is slated for 1 p.m. Friday.",Q1

There were 458 members of state, local, federal and tribal law enforcement who died in the line of duty in 2021 - a 55 percent spike compared to 295 deaths in 2020, according to a preliminary report by the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum (NLEOMF).

Of those 458, 301 lost their lives due to coronavirus, making it the leading cause of death last year, while at least 182 officers died of the virus in 2020 - an increase of 65 percent in one year.

'This year's statistics demonstrate that America's front-line law enforcement officers continue to battle the deadly effects of the COVID-19 pandemic nationwide,' the report reads.

'Preliminary data shows that some 301 officer fatalities have been identified as caused by COVID this year, and this number appears to increase almost daily.'

Meanwhile, firearms were the second-largest cause of death in 2021, with 61 officers killed by firearms, making for a 36 percent increase from 2020.

And 19 of those officers who died due to firearms-relate deaths were killed in 'ambush attacks,' which also saw a significant increase, according to the report.

Traffic-related deaths saw a massive spike last year as well, with 58 officers killed in 2021 from vehicle and motorcycle collisions, making for a 38 percent increase when compared to 2020.

Last year also proved to have the highest total number of active-duty officers who died since 1930.

The report included a map of the United States, showing the 32 states where officers lost their lives from coronavirus, with the highest concentration centered in California, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.

'It has been reported to NLEOMF that these officers have died due to direct exposure to the virus during the commission of their official duties,' the report says.

The organization noted that these figures are preliminary and a the death count is expected to rise even more before official numbers are released, as NLEOMF determines whether other officers who contracted the virus did so while on the job.

NLEOMF added that its COVID-19 Task Force is currently working on establishing if other officers who died from coronavirus did so after exposure while on-duty.

More active-duty law enforcement died from COVID in 2021 than any other cause of death

'Law enforcement officers nationwide continue to be exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the course of their daily assignments; therefore, the number of line-of-duty deaths is sadly ever-increasing,' the organization said.

Meanwhile, police departments and unions across the country, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Phoenix, have continued to protest vaccine mandates for public employees, with many threatening resignation.

Some officers have even gone so far as to file lawsuits against their respective cities or states.

In Georgia, where most departments do not mandate the force be vaccinated, a total of at least 33 members of law enforcement died from the virus as of November.

Some police departments in states without vaccine mandates, such as Florida and Tennessee, have attempted to recruit officers with the incentive of not needing COVID vaccinations to work.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced that the state would promise not to 'get between you and your doctor' while advertising recruitment for the state's Highway Patrol.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has looked into signing legislation that would offer a $500 signing bonus to any unvaccinated cops who are willing to relocate to the Sunshine State for work.

In November, the Daily Mail reported that 12 NYPD officers had relocated to Lakeland, Florida - where there is no vaccine mandate and where cops said they felt more appreciated, leaving behind New York City where a late October deadline for vaccine mandates forced those who missed it to be placed on unpaid leave.

The amount of the U.S. population vaccinated so far currently stands at 74.5 percent of the country, who have received at least one dose as of January.

More than 62 million total cases have been reported in the U.S. and over 843,000 deaths recorded as of January.",Q1

Georgia Recorder

ATLANTA — Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan’s to-do list during his final year includes a tax credit to boost law enforcement, more resources for foster care, and higher wages for correctional officers.

Duncan said Wednesday that his focus will remain on completing his duties and getting his priorities passed before his time in the Senate concludes at the end of 2022. Then he plans to focus on his GOP 2.0 initiative aimed at retaking the Republican Party from the grips of former president Donald Trump and moving on from the 2020 election.

During the passage of the controversial election law overhaul through Senate Bill 202 last year, Duncan refused to preside over a debate on restricting absentee voting access, but ultimately supported the final Republican measure that’s now facing multiple lawsuits over claims of voter suppression.

During the upcoming session, Duncan said lawmakers should not focus on sending political messages or dwelling on the false claims of a stolen 2020 presidential election.

“I think from a political perspective, I think we should be done talking about the 2020 election cycle and we should move forward politically in a way that makes the most sense and builds more consensus,” Duncan said during a Wednesday afternoon news conference inside the state Capitol. “I think it’s a mistake to try to relitigate the 2020 elections. It was a fair election. We were able to make some improvements in the last session.”

Additionally, Duncan elaborated on his crime-fighting plan, the “Less Crime” Act, which would set up a $250 million tax credit for individuals and businesses that donate to local police departments and sheriff’s offices through certified law enforcement foundations.

Duncan, along with Republican colleagues Gov. Brian Kemp and House Speaker David Ralston, have all called for legislation designed to combat the rising rate of violent crime in Atlanta and other areas of the state.

Duncan’s plan is for departments to use the donated money to hire more officers, increase pay, provide more training, purchase equipment and improve resources to handle mental health-related emergencies.

“The Less Crime Act reaches far beyond political allegiances and allows citizens and corporations to be a partner in driving down crime rates,” Duncan said.

The lieutenant governor says he looks forward to providing better pay for corrections officers in order to combat the high turnover rate.

Professor Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said Duncan’s plan to use tax credits to support law enforcement could win enough supporters to pass as lawmakers compete to show they’re tough on crime.

Duncan’s membership in the post-Trump faction of the party, however, will put him at odds with some key figures within the party and chamber, he said.

Duncan’s refusal to support conspiracy theories peddled by Trump put him at odds with a large share of Georgia Republicans and dimmed his chances of winning a second term. His public call for Republicans to move on put Duncan in the national spotlight and laid the groundwork for his GOP 2.0 concept, detailed in a 2021 book.

In May, the former Cumming state House representative announced he wouldn’t seek a second term as lieutenant governor.

“With Duncan, that being a lame duck and ready to leave the stage, at least temporarily, he’s going to be presiding over a chamber in which there are competing candidates to succeed him,” Bullock said. “One of whom (Sen. Burt Jones) is Trump’s favorite, and the other (Sen. Butch Miller) who is not but who nonetheless seems to be moving toward the right to make it difficult for Burt Jones to be able to pass him.”

During this year, Duncan says he also hopes to create a foster care program that provides wrap-around services as teens age out of foster care.

“Whether it be just basic welfare needs, education, health, counseling, transportation and other areas to wrap around those individuals so that they can have a head start on life out of the foster care system,” Duncan said.

Another foster care initiative will be to work with Kemp and agencies to provide more resources to keep children out of extended-stay hotels when they don’t already have a foster parent.

“Another priority of ours is to end this vicious cycle by helping kids in foster care that show up with serious and significant physical or behavioral health issues,” Duncan said.

Despite Duncan’s focus on the upcoming session, Bullock says his future duties may have a much more lasting impact on politics.

“I would presume that he realizes that if his goals for GOP 2.0 are to be realized, that he’s in it for the long haul,” Bullock said. “It is not going to happen this year and maybe not until sometime after 2024 if there were then a rejection of Trump’s presidential bid.”",Q1

https://lawandcrime.com/crime/neighbor-says-slain-texas-parents-adopted-their-alleged-killer-two-decades-ago/,Neighbor Says Slain Texas Parents Adopted Their Alleged Killer Two Decades Ago,"﻿

A neighbor has identified a Texas couple found dead over the weekend. Authorities have arrested a man that same neighbor identified as the couple’s son.

San Antonio police said Sunday that Michael Vincent Burger, 20, shot and killed two people who were found outside of what seemed to be his apartment. The police chief said officers found the defendant with an “AR and a shotgun.” The police only vaguely said that the case may have involved family violence, and the police has heretofore not identified the victims.

However, a neighbor in Houston told a local television station there that Noreen and Bill Burger, both long-time career educators, were the ones killed. The couple had adopted the defendant, the neighbor said.

“They sent him to college. I remember around 20 years ago — or so — they were going to adopt him, and they were really excited,” Charlotte Green told KPRC.

“Never, ever would think something like that, ever,” Green said with reference to the killings.

Law&Crime attempted to confirm the victims’ identifies. The police department referred questions to the Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office on Tuesday. The ME did not immediately respond.

Citing information from the Spring Branch Independent School District, KPRC reported that Bill Burger was an assistant principal for the past 11 years; Noreen retired after 25 years.

“Mr. Burger was the guy you could go to if anything was going wrong in your life,” said Ian Stalnaker, an 8th grader at Cornerstone Academy. “You could always talk to him, count on him to be there and make those jokes.”

Green described the couple fondly.

“The nicest people,” she said. “Helpful. Always cheerful when we go to the mailbox.”

The neighbor also described defendant Michael Burger as friendly as well. He did chores in the neighborhood for extra money.

Green suggested Noreen and Bill Burger were in San Antonio to visit their son. The son reportedly went to school there.

“They’re going to be greatly missed,” Green said of the couple. “They were like the bright light in our neighborhood.”

Michael Burger is charged with capital murder of multiple persons, according to Bexar County court records. Bond was set at $500,000. The records do not yet list the name of a defense attorney.

The case is listed as “awaiting indictment.” A no-contact order was also entered the court records indicate.

Award-winning American journalist Brent Renaud was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, Ukraine, according to Kyiv region police in social media posts on Sunday. Kyiv police said another American journalist was wounded by Russian troops.

In a tweet, Kyiv region police named the 50-year-old American journalist who was killed as Brent Renaud. Police posted a photo of his body and his American passport as evidence, as well as a photo of an outdated New York Times press badge with Brent Renaud’s name.

An adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement that Renaud “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor,” according to a New York Times report.

CNN has been unable to verify which media outlet the American journalists were working for in Ukraine.

The New York Times said in a statement on Sunday, “We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years. Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago.”

Some more context: The northern Ukrainian city of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, has been the site of substantial Russian shelling in recent days and has seen extensive destruction, according to the Kyiv regional government on Friday.

Brent Renaud was a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, and journalist, who lived and worked in New York City and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to his biography on the Renaud Brothers website.

With his brother Craig, Renaud spent years “telling humanistic verite stories from the World’s hot spots,” including projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Egypt, and Libya, according to his website bio. Brent Renaud was a 2019 Harvard Nieman Fellow.

Christof Putzel, a friend and colleague of Renaud, told CNN his passing is a “devastating loss to journalism today.”

“I woke up this morning to the news that Brent, long-time best friend, incredible colleague, the best war journalist I think ever existed, finding out about his passing. Brent had this ability to go anywhere, get any story, listen and communicate what was happening to people that others wouldn’t otherwise see it. And it is a devastating loss to journalism today,” Putzel told Brian Stelter on CNN’s Reliable Sources Sunday.

Putzel said Renaud was working on a documentary about refugees around the world when the crisis in Ukraine hit. He said that “Brent was on the plane the next day” and covered the plight of refugees from Kyiv into Poland. A post on the Renaud Brothers’ Facebook page, dated March 8, urged readers to follow their coverage of the war Ukraine.

Several years ago, Putzel and Renaud won a duPont Award for a story they worked on about guns being smuggled into Mexico from the US. “What I said when we accepted our award was, the only thing bigger than Brent’s balls are his heart. And I stand by that. That’s what kind of journalist he was,” Putzel said.

He said Renaud had a unique ability to make people trust him as he told their stories in places like Iraq and other war zones. “You could sit down and spend a week watching all of Brent’s stories over the years back-to-back and just be flabbergasted. The career that he had, his ability to reach people, his ability to capture the humanity behind people’s suffering is something I have never seen before, and I was just honored to work with him as long as I did,” Putzel said.

The director of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard said on Sunday that the foundation is “heartsick” over the death of American journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine.

“Our Nieman Fellow Brent Renaud was gifted and kind, and his work was infused with humanity. He was killed today outside Kiev, and the world and journalism are lesser for it. We are heartsick,” said foundation curator Ann Marie Lipinski in a tweet.

The Committee to Protect Journalists on Sunday condemned the killing of Renaud and called for the killers to be brought to justice.

The New York-based organization said in a statement, “U.S. reporter Brent Renaud was shot and killed, and another journalist was injured on Sunday in the city of Irpin, outside of Kyiv, according to a Ukrainian police official and news reports. In denouncing the shooting, the Committee to Protect Journalists called for the killers to be brought to justice.”

“We are shocked and saddened to learn of the death of U.S. journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine. This kind of attack is totally unacceptable, and is a violation of international law,” added the CPJ’s program director Carlos Martinez de la Serna in the statement. “Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once, and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account.”",Q1
http://saharareporters.com/2022/01/07/politics-or-forced-labour-new-america-china-tango-owei-lakemfa,Politics Or Forced Labour: The New America-China Tango By Owei Lakemfa,"Super heavyweights, the United States, US, and China wrestled in the last week of last year into 2022 on the issue of forced labour. The US had drawn the first blood when on Thursday, December 23, 2021, President Joe Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

It is an “Act to ensure that goods made with forced labour in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China do not enter the United States market, and for other purposes.

As a trade unionist, I ordinarily take serious any labour issue. But I am sceptical when such comes from the US.

This is for several reasons, including my experience in the Governing Board of the International Labour Organisation, ILO. Although the US is the highest contributor to the ILO budget, sometimes as high as 22 per cent, it is notorious for giving scant regard to labour.

Image

It is the only country I know that does not recognise the international workers May Day. It also does not readily ratify ILO International Conventions which protect labour.

For instance, the US has ratified only 14 of the 189 Conventions of the ILO. Ironically, while America claims to be fighting against forced labour in the Xinjiang, China, it has for 92 years now, refused to ratify the ILO Forced Labour Convention No 29 which can protect workers worldwide against forced labour.

So, can America be trusted when it claims to be fighting forced labour in China while it refuses to ratify the international instrument against forced labour which can be domesticated to protect American workers?

Shouldn’t we admonish the physician to heal himself? Jesus Christ in Matthew 7:5 said: “You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.”

There are conventions fundamental to the basic protection of labour rights in America and the universe which the US has refused to ratify.

These include the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention No 87 of 1948, the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention No 98 of 1949, the Equal Remuneration Convention No 100 of 1951, the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention No 111 of 1958 and the Minimum Age Convention No 138 of 1973.

I have not tried to argue whether there is forced labour or not in Xinjiang, China or that if such is proven, that country should not be sanctioned. All I have done is to explain why I am sceptical of American claims.

For instance, in the early 2000s President George .W. Bush, with the support of Britain’s Tony Blair, claimed that Iraq had large stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction which it could activate within 45 minutes.

The then Iraqi President Sadam Hussein was portrayed as an unstable mind who could unleash these weapons against the rest of humanity.

Even the United Nations was manipulated to pressure Iraq to give up the weapons. But after that country was invaded and destroyed with its leaders, including Hussein murdered, the USA could not produce a single such weapon owned by that country. Until today, Iraq remains an unstable country in ruins.

On August 2, 1964 there was said to have been a skirmish between the destroyer, USS Maddox and some North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats. While this was being processed, the US on August 4, 1964 claimed a more serious attack by the Vietnamese.

It showed images of Vietnamese torpedo boats engaged in the attack. On this basis, the Congress on behalf of the American people authorised President Lyndon B. Johnson to declare war on Vietnam.

The truth is that while the first attack was plausible, the second one which led to the declaration of war never happened.

It was a false narrative by the American establishment to provide a legal basis for the American invasion.

Millions of Vietnamese were killed in the war that followed. But America did not escape lightly as 45,148 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War, 304,000 injured, 1,244 remain missing while a record 503,000 American troops deserted.Another reason why the US cannot be taken serious on labour matters such as forced labour, is because it has its own unique definition of things.

For instance, forced labour, according to the ILO is “all work or service which is exacted from any person under the threat of a penalty and for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily.”

But America’s definition of forced labour is ridiculous and unimaginative. For example, in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic when countries, including the US, shut their borders against the rest of the world, small Cuba, in opting to save lives across the universe and combat the pandemic, sent over 3,700 doctors and medical personnel to 46 countries, including in Europe.

In the first five months of their mission, the Cuban White Coat Army treated 355,785 victims of the pandemic and saved 9,736 lives. Some, across the globe, including myself, campaigned that the Cuban medical personnel be awarded the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize.

However, America condemned Cuba on the basis that by sending the medical personnel abroad, the country was engaging in “forced labour” and “human trafficking”. Michael Kozak, Assistant US Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, said: “Crises (COVID-19) don’t justify trafficking medical professionals, who need protection now more than ever.” Senator Marco Rubio wrote the American government to sanction Cuba for alleged “forced labour”.

The then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, while criticising South Africa and Qatar for accepting medical assistance from the Cuban doctors bellowed: “We’ve noticed how the regime in Havana has taken advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue its exploitation of Cuban medical workers…Governments accepting Cuban doctors must pay them directly. Otherwise, when they pay the regime, they are helping the Cuban government turn a profit on human trafficking.”

Pompeo went on to announce new sanctions against Cuban officials involved with the humanitarian missions!

Can a country whose leadership cannot define forced labour be trusted with enacting a law on same?

The US did not base its new legislation on verifiable facts. Rather it did so on deductions that the cotton industry in Xinjiang which supplies nearly 84 per cent of China’s cotton has witnessed massive increases.

That since there are minority Uyghur prisoners in that region, they must have been used for such production increase. So the new US law requires each part of the supply chain to prove that its products to be sold in America, were not produced by forced labour.

A young girl in Chicago took two stray bullets to the head and died. Thus far this year, the nation has had 27 mass shootings.

Who or what is to blame? That depends on whom you ask, and sometimes, which news outlet is reporting.

New York State

New York’s “progressive” governor, Kathy Hochul, blames “illegal guns” for the recent shootings of two New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers, one of whom died. He was a 22-year-old rookie.

“We have a moral obligation to do everything we can to fight the scourge of illegal guns on our streets,” Hochul said in a statement. “Too many lives have been lost because of illegal firearms that should never have been on our streets.”

The cop-killer, Lashawn McNeil, used a gun he wasn’t legally allowed to own, with a 50-round drum magazine that is illegal in New York state.

So, who or what is to blame? Spoiler alert: the illegal gun didn’t load and fire itself. Maybe guns aren’t the real scourge here.

Chicago

An eight-year-old girl was hit by two “stray bullets” in Chicago. The bullets weren’t “stray” like a cat; they were purposely fired. Every indication is that the shooting was gang-related. That didn’t keep local residents from taking to the streets to advocate for “access to mental health care services.”

With the exception of Tony Soprano, how many gangsters are seeking a good shink for therapy?

Chicago’s leftist mayor, Lori Lightfoot, thanked the girl’s neighbors for “surrounding Melissa’s mother with love as she grieves the loss of her daughter.”

What Lightfoot and her state’s attorney, Kim Foxx, have failed to do is create a situation where a gang-banger might think twice about firing a weapon in the direction of a child. (Word on the street is there is a video showing the gang-related shooter firing his gun even though the young girl was in clear view).

Foxx has long been accused of letting violent felons out of jail, and it’s more than an accusation. It’s been happening for a while now.

If I were gangbanger, I’d feel empowered to commit all the violent crimes I want. What’s going to happen to me?

FACT-O-RAMA! By mid-2020, Kim Foxx had dropped over 25,000 felony charges, including charges for shootings, murder, and sex crimes.

Mayor Lightfoot is on the same page as her comrade Kathy Hochul; they blame the guns, not the person pulling the trigger or the leftist politicians who go easy on crime.

Some say we don't do enough for the police. Others say we do too much. All of this must stop. We have a common enemy: it's guns & the violence they bring. — Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) August 8, 2021

Just once I’d like to see a Democrat politician say, “Maybe letting criminals out of jail, ditching bail, and defunding the police was a horrible idea.”

Or better yet, blame the criminals.

Jason Riley, author of the 2014 book “Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make it Hard For Blacks To Succeed,” hit the nail on the head.

“Much more disturbing is that a half-century after the civil rights battles were fought and won, liberalism remains much more interested in making excuses for blacks than in reevaluating efforts to help them.”

There is nothing more convenient than an excuse, and leftists offer excuses for minority criminals every chance they get. It’s not the bad guy’s fault — it MUST be illegal guns, poverty, COVID, Trump, or “systemic racism” at fault for the massacre of minorities. Only a leftist could feel sorry for violent felons, even as their crimes result in dead kids of color.

Baltimore

There is no such thing as a “robbery gone bad”; that’s called MURDER. The press and the police need to stop using this phrase, as it implies that the murderer somehow had no choice but to shoot his victim — in this case, a 51-year-old grandmother. The criminal tried to rob the woman, she said no, and the man pulled a gun and killed her. He could have chosen to walk away, get a job, and live a crime-free life. (If the criminal hadn’t chosen to shoot the victim, would this be a “robbery gone well”?) Everyone has choices. This clown chose to rob a woman, and he chose to shoot her when she wouldn’t comply.

New York City

To his credit, New York City’s new Democrat mayor, Eric Adams, has vowed to bring back the plainclothes anti-gun unit, even though BLM has threatened riots if he does so. Past mayor Bill de Blasio disbanded the unit after BLM cried foul and claimed the unit unfairly targeted black men. What the unit actually did was target felons, regardless of race. What happened when the unit was disbanded? Crime in New York City soared, and most of the victims were innocent black people.

In short, BLM is getting black people killed.

The left needs to understand the following:

defunding the police, letting criminals out, and doing away with bail — all progressive policies — are getting people killed. Usually minorities;

BLM is a joke. Giving in to their demands has led to the slaughter of black people;

guns don’t fire themselves;

gangbangers don’t need a good shrink, they need to go to prison; and

making criminals, not their weapons, take responsibility and pay the price for their crimes will keep violent offenders off the streets.

This may not be a popular notion with libs, but bad people need to go to prison. Their crimes, not their skin color, should determine how long they spend in prison.

Also, the voters need to wake up. Voting Democrat is getting people, usually of color, killed at record-setting rates. White libtards vote for Democrats and minority communities pay the price.

I must say, the Democrats are masterful at making their voters hate Republicans even while liberal ideals are getting black people killed in record numbers, and turning blue cities into crime-ridden flea-pits.",Q1

There have been 3,170,649 cases of COVID-19 reported in Canada, 10,632 of them reported Feb. 11. Active cases were reported at 146,680 while resolved cases came in at 2,988,738. There were 113 deaths reported on Feb. 11 with total deaths coming in at 35,231. Nearly 90 per cent (88 per cent) of those vaccine eligible have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 83 per cent have had two doses.

The third booster dose percentage lags behind, with only 43 per cent of Canadians having gotten it by Feb. 10, according to Health Canada.

In Ontario, as of Feb. 13, there were 1,765 cases reported, with 862 active cases, 171 hospitalizations, eight people in the ICU and one person on a ventilator. The total case count since Jan. 20, 2020 is 1,074,485 with 40,921 hospitalized and 12,101 deaths reported. Eight new deaths were reported as of Feb. 13.

In Hastings Prince Edward County, there were 84 new high-risk cases and 381 active high-risk cases reported as of Feb. 14. Eight people have been hospitalized with two people in the ICU. Eleven deaths have been reported in high-risk settings like LTC facilities, and 32 deaths have been reported. People who have gotten their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in HPE number 145,999, while 134,888 people have had their second dose and 85,573 have received their third dose booster shot.

Survey results on lifting COVID-19 restrictions According to Leger survey results released Feb. 10, nearly 30 per cent of Canadians believe it’s time to lift COVID-19 restrictions and learn to live with the virus, while 43 per cent feel that such restrictions should be eased carefully.

The other 28 per cent were evenly split between those who don’t want to lift the restrictions and those who want to lift them all immediately. While public health experts concede that people are tired of the pandemic restrictions, they also caution that removing them too quickly or without enough forethought, could be a bad idea. Instead, they should be scaled back safely and gradually, based on science and public health expertise.

Ontario vaccine passport gone by March 1 On Feb. 12, Ontario Premier Doug Ford informed Ontarians that the vaccine passport system may soon be removed, on the advice of Ontario’s chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore, who believes they’ve fulfilled their purpose. The vaccine passport system requires people to show proof they’ve been fully vaccinated when entering indoor places like dining

facilities, meeting and event spaces, gyms, concert venues and other settings. As of Feb. 14, Ford had announced that the vaccine passport system would be lifted as of March 1.

Ford emphasized that the plans to do away with the vaccine passport system had nothing to do with the current trucker protests happening in Ottawa and in other cites across the province and that it had been in the works before the protest started.

Ontario state of emergency declared Feb. 11 At a press conference on Feb. 11, Ontario declared a state of emergency due to the truck protests going into their third week in Ottawa, similar protests in various cities across the province and the truck blockade since Feb. 7 at the Ambassador Bridge that connects Windsor to Detroit,

Michigan.

The truckers’ protest was initially to rally against the vaccine mandates for truckers who cross the Canada-U.S. border. While it started out about the mandates affecting cross-border truckers, it expanded to protest all COVID-19 restrictions and a call for them to end.

Premier Doug Ford’s government enacted orders making it illegal and punishable to block goods, services and people along critical infrastructure like the aforementioned Ambassador Bridge, as well as airports, highways, ports and other bridges. The state of emergency also makes it illegal to block municipal roadways and prevent ambulances and public transports from getting through. Fines carry penalties of up to $100,000 a day or up to a year in prison, with possible suspension of commercial and personal driver’s licences.

The Ambassador Bridge blockade is costing millions of dollars per day to the Canada and U.S. economies and job losses at some manufacturing plants.

Ford told the protesters that their right to make a political statement does not outweigh the right of people to earn a living, to get food and supplies across the Canada/U.S. border or the right of the citizens of downtown Ottawa to live peacefully and free from the harassment and chaos caused by the protests.

By Feb. 13, Windsor police had made over two dozen arrests and were working to completely clear the protest blockade from the Ambassador Bridge which was done by the end of day.

In Ottawa, a deal has been reached between Mayor Jim Watson and the organizers of the truckers’ protest to move some of the 400 vehicles away from residential neighbourhoods and closer to Parliament Hill starting Feb. 14, to reduce the disruptions on Ottawa residents. If this occurs by noon on Feb. 14, Watson has agreed to meet with the organizers to seek out a long-term solution to the protest, now in its third week.

Similar protests in other parts of Ontario, like Toronto, Fort Erie and Sudbury, show no signs yet of dispersing.",Q1

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latino-legal-advocates-breyers-legacy-consistent-voice-fairness-rcna13941,Latino legal advocates on Breyers' legacy: 'A consistent voice for fairness',"Latino advocacy groups, lawmakers and scholars had nothing but praise for Justice Stephen Breyer, the great-grandson of immigrants from Romania, after he announced his retirement from the Supreme Court on Thursday.

“I think he was a moderate liberal who could be counted on to come out on the right way on a lot of cases that affected Latinos,” said Kevin R. Johnson, the dean of the University of California Davis School of Law, who is of Mexican American heritage.

“Breyer is a consistent voice for moderation, fairness, and he has an international perspective that some of the other justices don’t have,” Johnson said. In 2016, Breyer addressed 32 judges from across Latin America as part of a Department of Justice judicial training program held in Puerto Rico.

Andrew Crespo, professor at Harvard Law School, clerked for Breyer during the 2009-10 term. He recalled going to lunch with the justice, which required finding a spacious restaurant, “so that, when we’re sitting down and he’s telling us all these stories about the court, that we weren’t accidentally sitting next to a reporter.”

“He bounced back from defeats faster than, I think, his clerks did,” Crespo told Bloomberg Law’s Cases and Controversies podcast. “He always thought maybe, maybe the best will come.”

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., said in a statement that Breyer had served on the court with ""integrity and distinction.” Former San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro tweeted praise for Breyer’s “long, distinguished career in public service.”

Carlos M. Bollar, national president of the Hispanic National Bar Association, sees Breyer’s retirement — he plans to step down when the court recesses for the summer — as an opportunity to add diversity to the court.

“We know that the president has promised to appoint an African American woman to the court,” Bollar said, “so we encourage the president to consider Afro Latina candidates.”

“Latinos are about 1 in 5 of the population,” Bollar said. “Yet even at the Supreme Court where we have one of our role models and a spectacular justice (Sonia Sotomayor), we are only 1 in 9.”

Here's a look at Breyer's role in decisions that had a significant impact on the nation's Latinos.

Health care access: An estimated 4 million Latino adults and 600,000 Latino children have accessed health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is credited with bringing the Latino uninsured rate down from 43 percent in 2010 to 24 percent in 2016. But the future of Obamacare was far from certain in 2012. That year, in a challenge to the law’s individual mandate, Breyer sided with the majority and upheld the law, preserving health care for millions of Latinos and other Americans. Last year, as the ACA faced another legal challenge, Breyer wrote the majority opinion, dismissing the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.

Immigration: In 2020, the future of DACA was at stake, as the Trump administration sought to end the program granting deportation relief to young people who were brought to the U.S. as young children but lack legal immigration status. In that case, Breyer was part of the majority that ruled for the “Dreamers” and handed Trump a legal defeat. In 2012 Breyer joined the majority in striking down parts of Arizona’s “papers, please” law that disproportionately affected the state's Latino residents, affirming the federal government’s “broad, undoubted” power over immigration matters. In Zadvydas v. Davis (2001), Breyer wrote the majority decision, setting a precedent that the government could not hold migrants in detention indefinitely, while showing how constitutional concerns could apply to noncitizens.

Affirmative action: In 2004, Breyer said that his “most important” case was when he voted to uphold the right of Michigan Law School to consider race in admissions decisions. He had a chance to revisit the issue in 2013 and 2016, when an affirmative action lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin twice reached the Supreme Court. In the first instance, Breyer was in the majority, sending the case back to the lower courts, and a few years later he voted to uphold the university’s affirmative action policies. This case has been particularly important, given that there are an estimated 11.5 million Latinos in Texas and Hispanics consistently rank education as one of their top concerns.

The census: Breyer was in the majority in Department of Commerce v. New York (2019), finding that the Commerce Department had not followed proper procedure in their attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. In Trump v. New York (2020), which centered on the Trump administration’s attempt to exclude approximately 11 million undocumented people from the census count, Breyer wrote that “this court should not decline to resolve the case simply because the government speculates that it might not fully succeed.” (The majority tossed the case on the grounds that it was too soon to rule on the legality of Trump’s plan.)

Gun control: Although Latinos hold varied views on gun control itself, crime and gun violence is a major issue for them. In a 1995 case involving a Latino student who brought a gun to school in Texas, Breyer dissented from the majority opinion; he wrote that Congress could regulate guns in school under the commerce clause of the Constitution. In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), Breyer likewise wrote a dissent, saying that “there is simply no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the Second Amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime-ridden urban areas.”

Voting rights: Breyer dissented from the majority in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), when it struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Last year, he also dissented when the court upheld two election laws in Arizona, where the population is about one-third Latino. Some experts and advocacy groups say that these measures make it harder for minorities to vote.

Lourdes M. Rosado, president and general counsel of LatinoJustice PRLDEF, said in a statement that Justice Breyer “made great strides in defending and supporting voting, immigration and fair housing rights among other issues. President Biden has an opportunity to nominate a jurist grounded in protecting the civil rights of all people, including Latinos.”

Pakistan Pakistan Government recommends ban on crypto currency

The government and the SBP on Wednesday recommended a complete ban on crypto currency.

KARACHI (Dunya News) – The government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Wednesday recommended a complete ban on crypto currency, Dunya News reported.

According to the recent developments in the crypto currency case, the reports submitted in the Sindh High Court suggested that crypto currency is illegal and the use of this currency should be forbidden in business.

The court while giving orders to send the reports to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Law for detailed analysis in accordance with all aspects of law, passed remarks that both ministries are bound to give final deliberations within three months and in case of implementing the ban, the court will be informed about the legal status for the ban.

Justice KK Agha passed remarks that in case if it’s permitted to use the currency in business, then a legal form shall be prepared in this regard, while the concerned authorities will decide the status for the use crypto currency and the related institutions will take action according to the law.

The bill would effectively prevent school personnel from using restraints like zip ties, handcuffs and straight jackets on disabled children.

Disability advocates say for kids with disabilities, such restraints do a lot more harm than they provide help. The state has recorded numerous cases of children bearing physical bruises and scars after being forcefully restrained. Some have suffered broken bones.

The legislature banned the use of seclusion techniques for most kids with disabilities a year ago, but lawmakers stopped short of doing the same for mechanical restraints. Under this year’s bill, the only people who would be allowed to use such restraints are school law enforcement, security, resource officers or safety officers. Such restraints could only be used on children in grades 6 through 12.

The use of restraints in school has declined a lot in the past decade as the issue gained more notoriety—yet Disability Rights Florida Policy analyst Caitlin Clibbon notes it's still happening in Florida public schools.

“It’s not a huge number of kids, but so far this year, 59 kids in Florida had mechanical restraints used on them at schools. It’s still happening, but it’s only in a small subset of districts,"" she recently said in a House committee hearing on the bill.

Most of the state's school districts are finding other ways to calm children who may need help.

Jacksonville Democratic Rep. Tracie Davis, a former special needs teacher, said in the past too many kids with disabilities were being unnecessarily subjected to seclusion and restraint. There’s a place for it—she said, but in most cases, it's unnecessary and acknowledged there are far better ways to help children who may be struggling.

“When you’re dealing with children with special needs, they are stronger at certain times,"" Davis said, “It’s unfortunate that we’re here because sometimes, we shouldn’t have to legislative common sense. But in situations like this, when we’re dealing with students with special needs, that’s what it takes: common sense, passion and patience. Been there, done that.”

The language was in a bill championed last year by Democratic Rep. Bobby DuBose and Senator Lauren Book, but got stripped out. This year's sponsor, Republican Rep. Rene Plascencia, a former social studies teacher, told committee members it’s time to take care of that unfinished business.

For Plascencia, the issue of restraining disabled children is deeply personal. Some kids with significant disabilities can lash out or get violent. He says he didn’t fully understand the issue until his nephew was diagnosed with Autism.

“He’s non-verbal, he can be violent though he’s a tiny little kid,"" Plascencia said, getting choked up as he described watching his nephew's grandparents struggle to care for their grandchild.

Plascencia said the bill is aimed at encouraging greater use of behavior therapy, which he said has helped his family address his nephew's needs.

The years-long effort to stop the use of restraint in schools said Placencia ""bring us closer to having all children have the ability to be successful as they grow and learn, and live a life of independence.”

The ideal outcome would be to have no child subjected to physical restraints. Yet disability rights advocates are optimistic that this is the year the legislature is finally ready to take more action in curbing their use.",Q1

The yearlong quest to enact new voting rights legislation ended in the Senate on Wednesday, with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) siding with the 50 Republicans against changing Senate filibuster rules to allow the bill to pass.

Advertisement

With the Senate’s failure to pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, those laws ― limiting voting access and, in Georgia, enabling partisans to purge local election boards ― will remain on the books for the foreseeable future.

The votes capped a long day of speeches that recalled an institution of yesteryear, with most senators physically in their seats, listening intently to colleagues on both sides of the aisle and even occasionally engaging in real debate with each other on a piece of legislation ― a rare sight for the so-called “world’s greatest deliberative body.”

The House-passed version of the legislation is a combination of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. It would have set federal guidelines for voter access requiring states to allow early and absentee voting, online and automatic voter registration, make Election Day a holiday and restore voting rights to ex-felons, among other things.

The bill also would have restored sections of the historic Voting Rights Act gutted by Supreme Court decisions in 2013 and 2021, and would have provided an affirmative right to vote and access to the ballot that could be enforced in court. In addition, the measure contained limits on partisan gerrymandering and a ban on undisclosed dark money in elections.

Voting rights legislation was always going to clash with the filibuster when it came to the Senate. Filibuster rules require 60 votes to begin and end debate for most legislation before moving to a final vote. Since Democrats control just 50 votes and Republicans are almost universally opposed to voting rights legislation, the only way to win passage was to change the filibuster rules.

Advertisement

Early on, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declared that “everything is on the table” in the effort to pass voting rights legislation. Schumer announced plans to use the so-called nuclear option of changing the Senate rules in the middle of a Senate session on a simple majority vote in order to alter the filibuster enough to allow voting rights to pass. This is what both the late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did in 2013 and 2017, respectively, to eliminate the filibuster for judicial and executive branch nominations.

Schumer’s proposed filibuster rule change would require the filibustering minority to actually talk to block a bill while holding a minimum of 41 senators on the floor at any given time. When they ceased talking or failed to hold 41 senators on the floor, a simple majority could vote to pass the bill under consideration. This change would only apply to this one vote only.

“Isn’t the protection of voting rights and preventing their diminution more important than a rule in the Senate?” Schumer asked Wednesday in a speech aimed at Manchin and Sinema, with nearly every Democrat seated at their desks in a rare scene on the Senate floor.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), meanwhile, warned that a partisan filibuster rule change would “break the Senate,” dismissing Democrats’ calls to protect voting rights as “fake hysteria.” He went on to call Wednesday “in all likelihood the most important day in the history of the Senate as an institution.”

The proposed rules change was the closest Democrats got to Manchin’s supposed interest in restoring a “talking filibuster,” while providing a path for the bill to pass. However, Manchin drove the final nail in the coffin on that idea Wednesday after hours of lengthy speeches on the Senate floor, with many of his colleagues speaking passionately on behalf of acting to protect voting rights.

“Eliminating the filibuster would be the easy way out,” Manchin said, suggesting lawmakers focus on possible areas of agreement, such as reforms to the way electoral votes are counted. “I cannot support such a perilous course. ... It’s time we do the hard work to forge the difficult compromises that can stand the test of time.”

Advertisement

Placing a hand on his heart, Manchin then turned to his fellow Democrats and asked them to respect his opinion against pushing through rule changes on a partisan basis.

Throughout 2021, Manchin and Sinema stated their opposition to eliminating or weakening the filibuster. Manchin even announced his opposition to the House-passed voting rights bill, the For The People Act, in June.

But Democrats continued holding hope after Manchin agreed to negotiate a compromise voting rights bill with seven other senators that he said could win Republican support.

After co-writing the bill, Manchin then tried to pitch it to Republicans with no success. He also tried to get Republicans to support the House-passed John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore the Voting Rights Act, but only gained one GOP co-sponsor, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski.

Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) are set to side with all 50 Republicans voting against changing the Senate's filibuster rules to pass voting rights legislation they claim to support. Kent Nishimura via Getty Images

Manchin’s heavy involvement in crafting and selling the voting rights bills led Democrats to believe that he would be open to potential filibuster changes when the time came. He even engaged in extended conversations with Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) about possible reform options.

Advertisement

But, in the end, Manchin remained opposed to changing the Senate rules without Republican support. Sinema also doubled down by announcing her opposition to filibuster reform in a speech on the Senate floor just moments before Biden arrived to pitch the Democratic caucus on it.

This doomed the push for voting rights legislation and consigns voters in the GOP-run states that passed restrictive election legislation to jump through extra hoops to register to vote and cast their ballots.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of changes before the 2020 election that made voting more convenient. Some states adopted or expanded mail-in voting and liberalized absentee voting rules. Others introduced or expanded the use of drop boxes in which voters could place ballots. Early voting periods were extended.

But since the election, the GOP's false claims of voter fraud“are being repeated as justification for proposals to claw back recent advances that have made voting easier for Americans,” writes political scientist Douglas R. Hess .

The 2020 election was the ultimate stress test for the country's election system. Yet the federal government's election security agencies called it the“most secure in American history.”

That means, writes Hess, that“the often-claimed trade-off between election integrity and reasonable measures to make it easier for people to vote is, in fact, largely false.”

2. Claims of voter suppression don't hold up

Election law scholar Derek Muller takes issue with the negative characterization of the many recent election law changes . He examined the statutes that politicians and advocates have called“voting restrictions.”

While some, Muller writes,“could fairly be given that label, many are ordinary rules of election administration that simply don't merit those labels. Many bills will likely have no discernible effect, much less a negative effect, on the right to vote.”

One example, says Muller: A Utah bill“updates a law about how to remove dead people from the list of registered voters” and was passed unanimously by both houses of the Utah legislature. Among other straightforward elements of the bill is a provision that“increases the communication surrounding death certificates to election officials.” But that bill, Muller writes, was described by one voter advocacy group as restricting the right to vote.

3. Some voter suppression efforts won't change election results

Georgia, where Biden chose to make his speech on voting rights, has been a special focus for GOP-led efforts to limit those rights.

Georgia's new voting laws“don't really affect who is eligible to vote ,” writes political scientist Bernard Tamas ,“but they do make voting more difficult for poorer populations and those living in urban areas.”

Yet these laws may not change election results much,“if at all,” Tamas writes. That's because most U.S. voting districts – for both Congress and state legislatures – are“safely controlled by one party or the other. Laws that slightly reduce the number of potential voters are unlikely to shift power in Congress and state legislatures significantly.”

4. A surprising ending to 2020 absentee ballot conflicts

Pitched legal battles were waged in the run-up to the 2020 election over extending the regular deadlines – usually election night – for returning absentee ballots. There were two related reasons. First, the pandemic meant a huge surge in absentee ballots. Second, some expressed legitimate concerns about the capacity and integrity of the U.S. Postal Service to handle the volume of ballots in a timely way. In general, Democrats wanted deadlines extended; Republicans fought those extensions.

Constitutional law scholar Richard Pildes writes about the legal fight over ballot deadlines in Wisconsin and Minnesota .“In both, voters might be predicted to be the most confused about the deadline for returning absentee ballots, because those deadlines kept changing,” he writes.

A federal district court ordered Wisconsin to extend its election night absentee deadline by six days; the Supreme Court blocked that order and restored the state's deadline. That led Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan to lament in her dissent that tens of thousands of voters would lose their right to vote by missing that deadline. A similar legal conflict played out in Minnesota.

Yet in the end, Pildes writes, post-election audits showed that“even though voting-rights plaintiffs lost their battles close to Election Day in both Wisconsin and Minnesota, with the deadlines shifting back and forth, only a tiny number of ballots arrived too late.”

5. More Americans can vote in their native languages

It's hard to vote when you don't understand English. Communities with high numbers of citizens with limited proficiency in English have lower voter turnout. So the federal Voting Rights Act, write researchers Gabe Osterhout and Lantz McGinnis-Brown at the Idaho Policy Institute at Boise State University, requires those communities with significant groups of voters who are not proficient in English“to provide election materials in that group's language .”

Those materials range from registration and voting notices to actual ballots.

In December 2021, the list of places that would have to supply such materials was issued, and it includes“331 jurisdictions in 30 states” that are“are home to 80.2 million voting-age citizens, including 20 million people of Hispanic backgrounds.”

The effect of all this information, Osterhout and McGinnis-Brown write, is increased voter turnout among citizens who speak languages other than English.

Attorney General Bob Ferguson is urging consumers to be on the lookout for price gouging on at-home test kits for COVID-19. If you see price gouging, report it to the Attorney General’s Office at https://www.atg.wa.gov/file-complaint.

In the past week, Washingtonians filed complaints with the Attorney General’s Office regarding price gouging on at-home test kits. For example, one Washingtonian recently complained to the Attorney General’s Office about seeing a Facebook ad for test kits that were on “sale for only $49, down from $69 a box,” even though they “retail for $14.99 at places like Wal-Mart or Safeway.”

“One of our most valuable tools to combat price gouging is the personal experience of Washingtonians,” Ferguson said. “When you see a business charging exorbitant prices on products that are essential to our health and well-being, file a complaint with my office.”

Businesses that raise prices on emergency goods and services in order to maximize profit during a declared public health emergency or natural disaster commit an unfair business practice. The Washington Consumer Protection Act prohibits unfair and deceptive business practices.

Price-gouging legislation

Washington is one of a minority of states that does not have an anti-price gouging law. Last year, Ferguson proposed Attorney General Request legislation to prohibit price-gouging on emergency goods and services during a declared state of emergency. The bill included a clear definition of price-gouging: a 10% or greater increase in the business’ profit margin on an emergency good or service.

The Legislature did not pass the bill after certain business groups, including the Independent Business Association, objected. Consequently, the Attorney General’s Office is combating price gouging through the Consumer Protection Act’s general prohibition. Gouging consumers on emergency goods and services during a pandemic or natural disaster is an unfair and deceptive business practice. Courts have not defined what level of price increase constitutes as “unfair or deceptive.”

Price-gouging enforcement and “See It, Snap It, Send It” campaign

In 2021, the Attorney General’s Office responded to 1,300 price gouging complaints from Washingtonians. Investigators in the Attorney General’s Office followed up on leads by visiting hundreds of businesses all over the state.

In April 2020, Ferguson launched an awareness campaign encouraging Washingtonians to report price gouging in three easy steps: “See It, Snap It, Send It.”

Ferguson is encouraging anyone who sees price gouging, including on test kits, to snap a photo or take a screenshot, and then include the image with the complaint they file at the Attorney General’s website here. For more information on filing complaints, visit www.atg.wa.gov/file-complaint.

https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/08/as-jimmy-carr-stares-down-the-mob-remember-it-wont-stop-with-joe-rogan/,"As Jimmy Carr Stares Down The Mob, It Won't Stop With Joe Rogan","As Spotify mulls the fate of Joe Rogan, Netflix is facing pressure over British comedian Jimmy Carr’s latest stand-up special. If the 2020s feel like “Russian Doll,” it’s because we’re indeed reliving the same hopeless cycle day after day, trapped in a perpetual battle to protect people from corporate censorship. It’s dull and maddening all at the same time.

The problem is deeper than any individual, whether they’re too-big-to-cancel or someone less powerful. Our secular leadership class finds its purpose and salvation in earthly virtue signals, mining satisfaction from superficial politics, chasing dopamine boosts as they wage cultural warfare on addictive social media platforms. These endless daily battles are an unmistakable symptom of decadence, meaning the hole out of which we must dig is deeper than politics.

In his December special, Carr told a joke that goes like this: “When people talk about the Holocaust, they talk about the tragedy and horror of 6 million Jewish lives being lost to the Nazi war machine. But they never mention the thousands of Gypsies that were killed by the Nazis. No one ever wants to talk about that, because no one ever wants to talk about the positives.”

The punchline is misdirection, shock value, and the depravity of Carr’s on-stage persona. It would be a controversial joke even in normal times, but that’s where good comedians thrive as a necessary part of our ecosystem, making people laugh with satirical immorality to keep our boundaries open for free expression.

People are supposed to get mad. They’re supposed to demand censorship and carry on like Tipper Gore. The problem these days is their success rate.

Already, the U.K. prime minister’s office condemned Carr and pledged to ensure “streaming services are more accountable.” Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries followed up with a call for legislation targeted at speech hosted by platforms like Netflix. Here in the United States, the White House press secretary said last week “every platform” should be “doing more to be calling out mis- and dis-information” and “there is more that can be done” to address information shared by entertainers like Rogan.

Carr began the special by warning, “Tonight’s show contains jokes about terrible things. “These are just jokes, not the terrible things,” he added. Before the bit in question, Carr joked it would be a “career ender.” His prediction wasn’t a difficult one.

Carr acknowledged the uproar during a show over the weekend, saying, “I am going to get canceled, that’s the bad news. The good news is I am going down swinging.”

That really is good news, because free markets are the last best hope at this point. Of course, Big Tech platforms enjoy monopolies in many cases, cushioning them from the blowback of consumer demand. But Netflix and Spotify aren’t among them, and the lure of big money is still powerful—at least to a point.

Most voters don’t want the Biden administration to get involved in the debate over Rogan by applying pressure to Spotify. So why would Jen Psaki weigh in like she did?

Most Netflix users don’t care if the platform hosts some controversial stand-up, nor do Spotify users care if the platform hosts some controversial podcasts. So what explains Netflix’s ham-fisted response to the controversy or David Chappelle and Spotify’s decision to scrub dozens of episodes of Rogan’s show?

The ranks of our leadership class are filled with two kinds of people: true believers and capitalists cowed by them. The true believers terrify Boomer politicians and executives into meeting their anti-speech demands, and those politicians and executives are often successfully intimated or convinced that doing nothing would spark a public relations backlash, risking their power and profits.

But those demands are out-of-step with most of the public. It’s true our economy is splintering into niches, but platforms with mass appeal like Spotify and Netflix still cater to a base of customers that largely doesn’t crave censorship. Furthermore, the market is still (kind of) allowing platforms like Rumble, which publicly made Rogan a huge offer on Monday, the opportunity to compete.

The Daily Wire is making good movies Hollywood won’t touch. Heterodox thinkers and journalists are thriving on Substack. Podcasts like “Red Scare” succeed massively on Patreon. Tucker Carlson is enormously popular. Rogan, Carr, and Chappelle can still draw huge crowds.

None of this is because Western consumers are broadly bigoted, it’s because they’re labeled bigots by false definitions forced on the country at the behest of a small but growing group of true believers in newsrooms and board rooms. The complaints to Substack and web servers and advertising platforms show that none of this is going to stop unless the public speaks through the market and the market responds. If Rogan goes to Rumble, their servers and banks will face protests.

The sooner executives like Ted Sarandos and Daniel Ek determine the threat of a P.R. backlash is just hype, that it’s okay to say their own employees are wrong, and that a lot of money can be made off controversial entertainers, the sooner we can override the vocal minority and restore some sanity to American culture.

Original Publication Date March 29, 2022 - 3:11 PM

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — The Maryland General Assembly passed a bill Tuesday that would expand access to abortion by ending a restriction that only physicians provide them and requiring most insurance plans to cover abortion care without cost.

The Senate gave the measure final passage on a 28-15 vote. That sends the measure to Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, whose office did not immediately comment on his position on the bill. The governor has said he personally opposes abortion, though he has called the issue settled law in the state.

While the Senate would need 29 votes to override a veto, a Senate version of the bill passed with 30 votes Monday night, and several senators were excused Tuesday when the Senate passed the House bill.

Supporters say Maryland does not have enough abortion providers for the needs of the state. Sen. Delores Kelley, a Baltimore County Democrat who is sponsoring a Senate version of the bill, noted in earlier debate that many counties do not have a single provider.

“This is a big deal,"" said Karen Nelson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland. ""We know that just because it's legal on the books does not always mean that there's access, and so today the Maryland General Assembly made sure that there will be access.”

The bill would remove a legal restriction preventing nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants from providing abortions. It would create an abortion care training program and requires $3.5 million in state funding annually.

Opponents said the measure went too far.

“This bill is expanding further out,” said Sen. Justin Ready, a Carroll County Republican. “Maryland already is one of only four states that forces taxpayers to fund abortion, and we force it at pretty much every stage of the process.”

The legislation also aims to provide equitable access to abortion coverage, whether with private insurance or Medicaid. It would require private insurance plans, except for those with legal exemptions, to cover abortion care and without cost-sharing or deductibles.

The new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that banned states from outlawing abortion.

If they do, at least 26 states are likely to either ban abortion outright or severely limit access, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights.

That would force many women to travel to other states to get abortions, prompting Democratic-led legislatures like Maryland's to pass new laws to prepare for them.",Q1

The story of Arkansas politics in 2022 is an internal Republican battle between regular conservatives and more strident extreme conservatives.

At least that's what I assert in the latest installment on the state of Arkansas politics that I write each January for Talk Business and Politics.

The dynamic is best illustrated by a legislative set-to occurring several days ago, after I'd written the article.

It occurred between state Sen. Jason Rapert of Bigelow, a strident and extreme conservative, most notably on the issue of abortion, and state Rep. Jeff Wardlaw of Hermitage, a regular if pugnacious conservative.

The issue was that Rapert, running for lieutenant governor, has been campaigning in part by telling pro-life audiences they need to elect real pro-life legislators rather than the Republicans who spurned his effort to extend the recent special legislative session on income-tax cuts to take up an Arkansas duplicate of the Texas anti-abortion law.

Perfectly conservative Republican legislators agreed with their leadership and Gov. Asa Hutchinson not to extend the session for this new and odd Texas law tied up in court. A more direct assault on Roe v. Wade is pending from Mississippi before the U.S. Supreme Court with a likely ruling this year.

There was some regular-conservative belief in the Legislature that Rapert was raising the issue to grandstand for his lieutenant governor's race against Leslie Rutledge.

Wardlaw took Rapert aside the other day in front of several colleagues after a budget committee meeting and proceeded to give him a fiery piece of his mind. Wardlaw told me he was speaking for himself and many others in expressing deep resentment that Rapert would even intimate they aren't pro-life because of a single procedural vote.

Wardlaw said the Texas law's essence--paying taxpayer bounties, basically, for successful lawsuits against abortion cases--could be used in liberal jurisdictions to encourage and underwrite lawsuits against gun rights. He said it was a trial lawyer's bill.

Rapert always has been unrelenting on ""saving babies,"" as he chooses to describe the woman's-choice issue. He's not stopping now. In fact, he promises to try to extend the forthcoming fiscal session to seek again consideration of the Texas law. He argues from the zealous right wing that it's insufficiently pro-life to fail to take even an outside chance to stop just one abortion.

Rapert said in a text message Tuesday evening that, by his bringing the matter up again in the fiscal session, Hutchinson and other legislators ""will get another chance to make the right decision. If they refuse, the blood of dead babies will be on their hands.""

To remind: That's one Arkansas legislative Republican talking about other Arkansas legislative Republicans.

Who needs to fight Democrats when Arkansas Republican legislators have each other?

That's the dramatic way Rapert tends to talk. He is a preacher. He can be sanctimonious. I have dubbed him Church Lady.

And it's the kind of talk that regular conservative Republicans who uniformly oppose abortion don't appreciate.

Wardlaw tells me everyone knows Rapert will try again in the fiscal session. He says nothing will come of it. He does say there might be a substitute anti-abortion bill that legislators would choose to pass instead. It probably would redefine fetal viability to conform to the Mississippi law in case the Supreme Court upholds it and undercuts or destroys Roe v. Wade.

That also sounds more like political cover than essential policy.

I asked Rapert directly: Does he believe that professed pro-life Republican legislative colleagues who voted against his motion seeking to extend the special session are, in fact, not pro-life?

He tempered his rhetoric a bit, saying, ""I say they made a mistake and I hope they'll correct it when they get the opportunity at the fiscal session.""

Wardlaw and Rapert tell vastly differing accounts of their set-to. That's common in heated moments. And it's not really the point. What's significant is that the incident occurred and is a symptom.

What's telling is the sometimes vicious tone taken by Republican legislators, particularly senators, when they talk about each other on this and other matters.

A close longtime observer of the current Republican-overrun state Senate tells me the place simply hasn't had enough turnover in recent years and that members are sick of each other. That should soon change, with eight of 35 senators (including Rapert) leaving by personal choice or term limits, and at least two extremist conservative incumbents opposed by regular conservatives in Republican primaries.

For now, I feel comfortable telling you from broader not-for-attribution conversations that the state Senate is a conservative Republican nest of petty rivalry, clashing ego, resentment, backbiting and personal disdain.

Some of these people seem to think even less of each other personally than I think of the lot of them politically.

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/louisiana-appellate-court-reminds-6472510/,Louisiana Appellate Court Reminds Employers of the Strict Rules for Enforceable Noncompete Agreements,"Advanced Medical Rehab, L.L.C. (AMR), is a marketing company that represents several medical clinics in Louisiana and markets the medical services of those clinics to personal injury law firms. When AMR learned that Shelby Manton, who formerly had performed marketing services for AMR, had joined another company that allegedly competed with AMR’s business, AMR filed suit to enforce Manton’s noncompetition agreement. AMR sought a temporary restraining order against Manton, who had joined LA Health Solutions, a licensed healthcare provider network that provides medical treatment to patients. Manton’s contract with AMR contained a noncompetition clause that the trial court in Advanced Medical Rehab, L.L.C. v. Manton held to be “overbroad, overreaching and in violation of public policy” and in violation of each of the three requirements of Louisiana’s noncompetition statute, La. R.S. 23:291: “(1) a two-year maximum duration, (2) a list of the areas in which the former employee is restrained,” and (3) that the former employee works for a business that competes with the business of the former employer. AMR timely appealed, seeking review of the trial court’s judgments.

The Louisiana Court of Appeal, Fifth Circuit, affirmed the trial court’s rulings regarding the noncompete provision. First, the court held that the noncompetition agreement, which prohibited Manton from being an “ … employee … with any business (other than Advanced, or an affiliate) engaged to any extent in the business of Advanced, which includes but is not limited to, the marketing of medical services for chiropractic clinics and physicians …” was overbroad in the scope of the business competition restriction. (Emphasis in original.) Under Louisiana law, noncompetition agreements may limit competition only as to business similar to that of the former employer. The AMR provision, the court found, violated La. R.S. 23:921 as it prohibited Manton from employment in the practice of marketing for any business, not merely marketing medical services for medical clinics.

Second, the geographic scope of the noncompetition agreement violated the strict demands of La. R.S. 23:921, which requires the employer to identify the parishes or municipalities to which the agreement applies. Louisiana courts have construed this provision to mean that a worker must be able to determine in advance the parishes or municipalities in which he or she is giving up the right to work when signing an agreement. AMR’s noncompetition agreement identified twelve named parishes. The agreement also included the following provision: “[T]his non-compete agreement will apply in any parish in which Advanced has a contract and/or has an existing marketing relationship with a clinic to provide marketing services during the term of this contract or any relationship thereafter.” AMR cited Causin, L.L.C., d/b/a/ Bayou Safety and Supply v. Pace Safety Consultants, LLC, a 2019 decision in which a Louisiana appellate court upheld a noncompetition agreement that included a provision allowing the employer to amend the geographic scope with the employee being given the option to dispute the amendment. (We previously discussed Causin and its employer-friendly ruling.) In Manton, the court found that “no such option existed,” as AMR claimed the “right to unilaterally claim additional parishes” without giving Manton any opportunity to contest the scope. AMR’s provision, the court held, restricted Manton’s ability to conduct business in violation of La. R.S. 23:921.

Third, the court held the duration of the noncompetition agreement violated La. R.S. 23:921, which expressly limits a noncompetition provision to two years “from termination of employment.” AMR’s agreement provided a duration “for a period of two years after the termination of this contract and/or the relationship between the parties.” This language, the court held, was “overbroad” given the uncertainty of “when the contract and/or relationship between the parties would end.”

The court also determined that the invalid provisions could not be severed from the agreement as the severability clause “contemplate[d] invalidation based only on the grounds of an unreasonable time period or geographic scope.” It was silent on how the offending language should be severed for other grounds, as had been found in this case. The court therefore would be required to “rewrit[e] a disfavored contract,” which it declined to do given the “narrowly drawn statutory exception.”

The court reversed the trial court’s ruling that deemed moot Manton’s motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order and for an award of attorney’s fees. Without addressing the merits, the court remanded the issue for a hearing, instructing that La. C.C.P. art. 3608 allows for attorneys’ fees “‘rendered in connection with the dissolution of a restraining order’” to be included in the damages for the wrongful issuance of a preliminary injunction. Because the Fifth Circuit held that the trial court erred in finding there was sufficient evidence that Manton engaged in similar services as AMR, the restraining order was “wrongfully obtained” by AMR. As a result, the award of attorneys’ fees was still at issue.

Key Takeaways

Louisiana courts require that noncompetition agreements strictly comply with R.S. 23:921. Under section 921, a noncompete agreement is unenforceable in Louisiana unless the agreement strictly complies with the elements of section 921. An enforceable noncompete agreement must give the employee advance notice (1) of the nature of the employer’s business to be protected by the agreement; (2) that the temporal scope will last no more than two years from the date of termination (or other date certain); and (3) of the parishes or municipalities in which competition will be prohibited.

The Manton decision illustrates that Louisiana courts will examine closely whether agreements conform to the strict requirements of La. R.S. 23:921. Though Causin expanded an employer’s ability to restrict the geographical scope of an agreement, Manton makes clear that that expansion must be accompanied by allowing the employee to dispute the expanded scope. Manton also demonstrates the reluctance of Louisiana courts when asked to sever invalid noncompete provisions, when doing so would require the court itself to rewrite a provision in a contract already disfavored in Louisiana.

The Manton decision may serve as an example of how Louisiana courts view noncompete agreements that do not adhere to the statutory requirements of La. R.S. 23:921. Enforcement of an invalid noncompetition agreement may subject the employer to both attorneys’ fees and liability under the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.",Q1

https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/3-get-life-for-jogger-murder/cid/1846763,3 get life for jogger murder - Telegraph India,"A Georgia judge on Friday sentenced both Travis McMichael, the man who fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery, and his father to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but issued a lesser sentence of life with the possibility of parole to the other white man convicted of murdering Arbery, a 25-year-old black man whom they had chased through their neighbourhood.

The three men — Travis McMichael, 35; his father, Gregory McMichael, 66; and their neighbour, William Bryan, 52 — were convicted of murder and other counts in state court in November, resulting in mandatory life sentences. The main question before Judge Timothy R. Walmsley on Friday was whether Arbery’s murderers should be eligible for parole after 30 years, the earliest opportunity for such offenders under Georgia law.

The lead prosecutor, Linda Dunikoski, asked the judge to deny the possibility of parole to the McMichaels, arguing that they had displayed a reckless history of “vigilantism” before the killing. She noted that the elder McMichael had referred to Arbery as an “asshole” as his body lay in the street and authorities responded. “There’s been no remorse and no empathy from either man,” she said.

Before issuing the sentences, Judge Walmsley noted that Arbery had been chased for roughly five minutes while he ran from the men on foot. To illustrate the sense of time, and to emphasise the terror he said Arbery must have felt, the judge paused and let silence fill the room for one minute.

The pedestrian was heading north in the right-turn lane of southbound Du Pont Parkway near Joe Goldsboro/Paddock Road at around 12:42 p.m., state police reported. At the same time, a 61-year-old man from Clayton in a 2012 Mazda MZ2 driving south on Du Pont Parkway entered the right-turn lane, police said.

The Mazda began to drift, police reported, and the right side and rear tire hit the curb before driving off the road completely. The car continued through the grass in front of Stover Construction LLC for ""several feet"" before hitting a mailbox, police said.

https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2022/02/tyrant_trudeau_shows_his_true_colors.html,Tyrant Trudeau shows his true colors,"Like most liberal poster boys, Justin Trudeau's claim to fame wasn't based on his record or his talents. It was instead based on a famous father, virtue-signaling, and being a subscriber to groupthink.

From climate change conferences to marches for abortion, LGBT, and even BLM, Trudeau was always an eager participant, playing the part of a ""nice guy"" before slobbering media personnel and cameras.

But real nice guys don't feel any need to make a spectacle of their niceties. For them, the act of kindness itself is the reward. When an individual such as Trudeau dedicates most of his energy to the act, it is because he wants to conceal his hollowness.

Like most method actors, Trudeau eventually became a caricature of himself.

Trudeau once urged a woman asking him a question at a town hall event to say ""peoplekind,"" not ""mankind."" Alas for him, the act backfired — he was accused of mansplaining.

When he wasn't mansplaining, he played the part of an Indian folk dancer.

The goal was to project a sensitive, kind, boundlessly compassionate, and unrelentingly empathetic gent.

A bit of digging into his past proves otherwise.

On three occasions, Justin was photographed in blackface. Trudeau also expressed a fondness for evil totalitarians such as Fidel Castro and the Chinese Communist Party.

During his one-to-one meeting with President Trump in 2019, during a NATO conference, he was subservient like a dutiful schoolboy. Moments later, he was heard gossiping behind Trump's back about Trump's extended press conference.

Besides his pettiness and weakness that compelled him to indulge in backbiting, the remarks showed his mindset. Despite his claim to be a proponent of Democratic values, Trudeau regards the press as an inferior species. He cannot fathom why anybody would dedicate his time to answering questions from the press.

Well, Trudeau recently made an ample demonstration that he isn't the fervent supporter of democracy that he claims to be.

Trudeau was among the world leaders who used COVID-19 as a pretext to impose severe restrictions and mandates on the people of Canada.

When truckers staged a protest in Canada's capital of Ottawa against Trudeau's vaccine mandates, you would expect Mr. Nice Guy to meet with the representative of the truckers and negotiate a reasonable settlement. Perhaps even send them food and warm clothes as a mark of respect for their rights to protest.

But instead, Justin fled the capital and rushed to a safe house.

He then led a sustained campaign of demonization of the truckers.

The truckers were called White supremacists and racists among other pejorative terms. Trudeau has used similar terms for people skeptical about vaccines. The protest was called a blockade and an occupation. Trudeau has used these words in each of his utterances about the protest.

Chrystia Freeland, former journalist and Trudeau's deputy, is a willing participant in the strangulation of democracy. Perhaps Freeland and her husband, who works for the New York Times, were architects of the Goebbelsian media campaign against the protests.

The media relentlessly claimed it was a ""giddy terrifying siege,"" where protesters were harassing citizens, throwing rocks at ambulances, forcing business closures, and using racist slurs. They claimed that children were being used as shields. On television, every visual of the protests was accompanied by the noise of relentless blaring horns which they claim all through the night. There also were reported Nazis and Confederate flags being waved.

The demonization caused dehumanization gave them a reason to crack down on the movement.

Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act that has never been used before in Canada's history. The law grants Trudeau with power to prohibit public assembly, travel and restrict the use of specific properties. Trudeau could compel private businesses such as tow truck services to forcibly remove the trucks. It places restrictions on the media. It also grants permission to use the military, which Trudeau hasn't ruled out, maintaining that it would be ""a last resort.""

Trudeau's police seized fuel from the trucks and even impounded some vehicles.

They knew that funding is the lifeblood of the campaign, hence they colluded with Big Tech to facilitate the blocking of funds. Bank accounts of individuals associated with the protest were frozen.

The protesters have raised more than $9.6 million on their GoFundMe. GoFundMe withheld the money, citing police reports of violence.

When another fundraising site, GiveSendGo, was chosen, information about the donors was leaked by hackers. This leaked personal information of the donors was published by the likes of The Washington Post. Even Twitter allowed the information to be shared. Small donors were harassed and even compelled to shut down their businesses following harassment.

When Trudeau's political opponents (including a Jewish woman) questioned him about his draconian methods, Trudeau tarred her as associated with swastika-wavers.

Finally, the organizers of the protest, Chris Barber and Tamara Lich, were arrested.

On Thursday, the Ottawa Police had ordered the protesters to leave or face arrest. Media have been asked to stay away from areas or face arrests. Police also set up approximately 100 checkpoints around the secured area.

If that doesn't work, Trudeau may even send his minions to infiltrate the protests and cause violence in order to give him more pretext to apply force.

In just a few days, Trudeau has transformed Canada into North Korea by assiduously following the user's manual for tyrants.

The Biden administration has been scant in its criticism of Trudeau, perhaps because they may be weighing following Trudeau's footsteps in the U.S. in near future.

The result of Trudeau's act of empathy and compassion ceases to work. Even his media cheerleaders are recognizing this. When one claims to be empathetic, it involves empathy for critics and an understanding of their criticisms.

Trudeau's pledges of standing for the working class and the downtrodden seem hollow. He seems to have forgotten that, at the height of the pandemic, truckers risked their lives and abandoned their families to deliver essential commodities to everybody.

Trudeau's instinct to avoid dialogue, and designating protesters as adversaries, has been an eye-opener for all. Trudeau probably thinks all protesters are right-wingers; hence, his actions are endorsed by his liberal voters.

Living for prolonged periods in his ivory tower has probably caused Trudeau to forget that most of ""peoplekind"" abhor mandates and love freedom. Vaccine skeptics exist across the ideological spectrum due to ""experts"" such as Fauci frequently changing claims about the vaccine and tyrants such as Trudeau mandating them. Trudeau's actions will be remembered the next time they go to the voting booth.

The likes of Trudeau's charade of empathy and compassion may con voters during times of peace and prosperity. It is easy to make speeches, participate in marches, and smile before the camera to win over people because the administration is run by bureaucrats.

But in extraordinary tough times such as these, people look to their leaders to be smart, resourceful, and adaptable and to apply their common sense.

Trudeau has been a catastrophe. Worse, he has proved to be a cowardly tyrant. Hopefully, voters beyond Canada are learning that behind nearly every liberal virtue-signaling and perpetually smiling charlatan, there usually is an evil tyrant.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1668598,"Afghanistan’s future hinges on Pakistan ties, western aid: reports","WASHINGTON: Funding by the United States and other nations and the Taliban regime’s relations with Pakistan will shape Afghanistan’s future, say two recent reports by a US federal institution.

In these reports, the Washington-based US Institute of Peace (USIP) reminds the United States and its allies that humanitarian aid alone cannot prevent an economic collapse in Afghanistan.

USIP released the two reports this week as part of a larger report summarising the studies it conducted during 2021 on Afghanistan and other issues.

Positive relationship with Islamabad could help foster stability, development

Elizabeth Threlkeld, the author, believes that the aid given by the United States and partner nations to the Afghan government from now onwards would shape the country’s future.

According to her, the extent of support the Taliban receive from external sources, mainly Pakistan, would also be a deciding factor in determining Afghanistan’s future.

Based on interviews with Afghan and Pakistani experts, one of the reports identifies key drivers of conflict and connection between the two countries while explaining how the bilateral relationship could affect future outcomes in Afghanistan.

The report points out that under current circumstances, “a positive relationship with Pakistan could go a long way in fostering stability and development”. The report, however, warns that the “opposite is a much likelier outcome, given the deeply held grievances on both sides”.

By addressing one another’s security and sovereignty concerns through dialogue, “Afghanistan and Pakistan stand the best chance of building on their cross-border ties for the benefit of regional stability and the well-being of their citizens”, the author argues.

One of the key issues is the dispute over the Durand Line, which led to clashes between Pakistan and Taliban border guards this week. Pakistan wants Afghanistan to recognise the line as the international border while the Taliban, like previous Afghan governments, are not willing to do so.

The report claims that the relationship between the two countries will continue to be shaped by tensions that have characterised it for more than a century. Five recurring drivers of these tensions, according to the report, are: sovereignty concerns, security interests, geopolitical dynamics, cross-border ties, and connectivity and trade.

“Together, these dynamics will shape future prospects for stability in Afghanistan and the broader region,” the report adds.

In the other report — “How to Mitigate Afghanistan’s Economic and Humanitarian Crises — author Dr William Byrd writes that the primary economic shock to Afghanistan was the abrupt cut-off of aid — about $8 billion a year — and the freezing of Afghanistan’s $9bn of foreign exchange reserves. He also notes that recently both the United Nations and the United States took several measures to ease their sanctions on the Taliban.

But Dr Byrd warns that providing humanitarian aid alone cannot salvage the Afghan economy and suggests “expanding sanctions relief to encompass private business and commercial transactions”.

He argues that the risk this relief “will materially support the Taliban in a substantial way is acceptably low compared to the costs of a continued economic implosion”.

Dr Byrd also suggests paying the salaries of health workers, teachers and other essential-service providers, using a combination of Afghan revenues and aid funding.

He also suggests releasing $900 million of Afghanistan’s foreign exchange reserves to the country’s banks, arguing that “this would shore up the banking system and forestall its imminent collapse”.

Dr Byrd also suggests gradual release of additional foreign exchange reserves over time to cushion the economic shock and support the balance of payments, facilitating the Afghan economy’s adjustment.

He argues that reserves could also be used for specific purposes not directly involving the Taliban, such as paying bills for electricity imports from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and servicing sovereign debts owed to international financial institutions incurred by the previous government.

Dr Byrd also urges Kabul’s new rulers to restore a degree of independence in the Ministry of Finance and the state bank and appoint competent, experienced technocrats to key positions.

It’s also important to make “a credible, publicly available national budget for this year, which can be assessed by the World Bank and other outside agencies”, he argues.

https://www.techspot.com/news/92932-developer-nukes-extensively-used-js-libraries-protest-corporate.html,Developer nukes his extensively used JS libraries to protest corporate use without compensation,"A hot potato: Open-source software (OSS) comes in a variety of flavors. Some are massive projects developed and maintained by thousands of volunteers. Others are smaller programs that might only be supported and worked on by a single developer sharing to GitHub. Because OSS is sometimes freely used by large corporations, there is a bit of controversy over whether these companies should contribute to the community monetarily.

It appears that an open-source developer has intentionally fried two widely used javascript libraries. The commits to faker.js and colors.js caused programs using them to get stuck in an infinite loop.

Developers use the faker library to generate fake contextual data for testing or demos, while colors adds color to javascript consoles. Thousands of programs use these public packages, with faker seeing around 2.5 million weekly downloads and another 22.4 million per week for colors.

Marak Squires, the developer of the two libraries, uploaded version 6.6.6 of faker to GitHub and the NPM registry earlier last week. Colors ""v1.4.44-liberty-2"" was committed on Saturday. Both updates cause the same behavior. When called, ""Liberty Liberty Liberty"" outputs on the first three lines followed by a string of Zalgo text representing an American flag. Colors has since been fixed, but faker remains on version 6.6.6. Developers using faker should switch back to the last valid version (5.5.3).

NPM has reverted to a previous version of the faker.js package and Github has suspended my access to all public and private projects. I have 100s of projects. #AaronSwartz pic.twitter.com/zFddwn631S — marak 🗿 (@marak) January 6, 2022

Squires's reasoning for sabotaging the libraries is unclear. Some suggest that because of the ""liberty"" theme and a seemingly sarcastic GitHub issue report, Squires may be trying to grab attention for the plight of unthanked open-source developers.

Back in November, in a comment thread on his faker.js GitHub page titled, ""No more free work from Marak - Pay Me or Fork This,"" Squires said he was going to quit freely supporting ""Fortune 500"" companies that, in his mind, steal his work without compensation.

""Respectfully, I am no longer going to support Fortune 500s ( and other smaller sized companies ) with my free work,"" he noted. ""There isn't much else to say. Take this as an opportunity to send me a six-figure yearly contract or fork the project and have someone else work on it.""

Squires has also changed the ""read me"" file for faker.js to simply say, ""What really happened with Aaron Swartz?""

Aaron Swartz was a developer/hacktivist who helped found Creative Commons, RSS, and Reddit. Swartz was accused of stealing documents from JSTOR to make them public and then committed suicide in 2013 after a prolonged legal battle.

The responses to the colors.js/faker.js author sabotaging their own packages are really telling about how many corporate developers think they are morally entitled to open source developers' unpaid labour without contributing anything back. — the intersex intifada 🏳️‍🌈🏴 (@sadiekatze) January 9, 2022

Regardless of his motives, the stunt got Squires suspended from GitHub, removing his access to the two affected libraries, as well as the hundreds of other public and private projects he has uploaded.

While most in the community were not surprised that GitHub punished Squires for rendering his own software useless, many support him for his decision to call attention to a for-profit industry that has grown to feel entitled to the unpaid labor of others.

""Removing your own code from [GitHub] is a violation of their Terms of Service? WTF?"" said developer Sergio Gómez in support of Squires's actions. ""This is a kidnapping. We need to start decentralizing the hosting of free software source code.""

""The responses to the colors.js/faker.js author sabotaging their own packages are really telling about how many corporate developers think they are morally entitled to open source developers' unpaid labour without contributing anything back,"" tweeted another OSS community member.

It's worth mentioning that most members of the OSS community support the continued development of free-to-use software because they are passionate about programming. However, there is an expectation that those that benefit from OSS use contribute something back to the community, even if it's just fixing bugs or some other type of support.",Q1

Dennehy, 39, who was jailed in 2014 after killing three men during a 10-day spree, was engaged street robber Hayley Palmer while they were both behind bars.

The pair both were incarcerated at the privately-run HMP Bronzefield in Middlesex, but they split after being moved to separate prisons.

Palmer, who is now a free woman after serving 16 years, has opened up about their romance with the killer, revealing Dennehy had 'no regrets' and would 'laugh' about her crimes.

In a letter seen by the The Sun on Sunday, Dennehy wrote: 'You have a fully committed psychopath.

Joanna Dennehy, 37, (pictured) was jailed for life in 2014 after killing three men during a 10-day spree

Dennehy was reportedly engaged street robber Hayley Palmer (pictured), who has been released after serving 16 years

'Together we will travel a path so beautifully dark, so mentally and physically dangerous we will cease to know where I begin and you end.'

Mother-of-two Dennehy is one of only two women in Britain serving a whole-life prison term - the other is Rose West.

She stabbed three men to death whose bodies she dumped in ditches outside Peterborough, where she lived before knifing two more men in Hereford.

Dennehy's first victim was a Polish man, Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, who had come to believe Dennehy was his girlfriend.

She lured him to a property with suggestive texts, then stabbed him through the heart.

Dennehy then used a pocket knife to kill her housemate John Chapman, 56, stabbing him once in the neck.

Serial killer Dennehy is currently serving a full life sentence - one of only two women to be doing so in the country

The third victim was her landlord, Kevin Lee, 48, who she lured with the promise of sexual favours.

Excited by the police manhunt for her, she then stabbed Robin Bereza from behind in Hereford on April 2, 2013. Nine minutes later, she knifed John Rogers.

Both men survived and Dennehy was caught after two days on the run.

'She laughed at the situation and had no regrets at all', said Palmer.

Palmer met the killer at HMP Bronzefield but were later moved to separate prisons, with Palmer going to HMP East Sutton Park in Kent while Dennehy now resides in HMP Low Newton in Durham.

In May 2021, friends told the Mirror Palmer was seeking legal advice on arranging the wedding to Dennehy despite her life tariff for murdering three men.

'It's a very strange relationship. It's very weird to say but they seem good for each other', said the friend.

'Hayley speaks about Joanna like she's her high school sweetheart. They talk every single day and fully intend to get married.

'Hayley joked that they would not be allowed to cut their wedding cake because there's no way that they'd let Joanna have a knife.'

The couple reportedly wanted to be married by the end of the year - however Dennehy is said to have broken off contact with Palmer two months ago.

Dennehy, who was brought up in a stable family home in the Home Counties, carried out her horrific attacks to gratify her 'sadistic love for blood'.

The Old Bailey was told the killer had a 'sexual and sadistic motivation'.

Later she told a psychiatrist: 'I killed to see how I would feel, to see if I was as cold as I thought I was. Then it got more -ish.'

Dennehy (pictured) told psychiatrists she killed 'to see how it would feel' and found it more-ish

Experts said Dennehy craved notoriety and wanted to humiliate her victims through sick sex games. Before the killings she had boasted she had already killed four times.

When the three bodies were found, police launched a high-profile murder investigation.

Meanwhile Dennehy travelled to Hereford and started scouring the streets with accomplice Gary Stretch for more men to kill.

She told him: 'I want to have my fun.'

The pair randomly selected two dog walkers, retired fireman Robin Bereza, 64, and John Rogers, 56.

Dennehy stabbed them in frenzied knife attacks. Both survived the horrific attacks only because of swift medical intervention.

During her search for further victims, Dennehy posed for photos with a huge serrated knife and bragged that she and Stretch were 'like Bonnie and Clyde', whose gang killed nine policemen in 1930s America.",Q1
https://www.lifenews.com/2022/03/11/democrats-celebrate-abortionists-we-thank-them-for-killing-babies/,Democrats Celebrate Abortionists: “We Thank” Them for Killing Babies,"Pennsylvania Democrat leaders, under the guise of “women’s health” advocacy, thanked abortionists Thursday for killing unborn babies in abortions.

The special statement came from the Pennsylvania Women’s Health Caucus in honor of Abortion Provider Appreciation Day on March 10. State Sens. Judy Schwank and Amanda Cappelletti and state Reps. Morgan Cephas and Mary Jo Daley, all Democrats, signed onto the statement.

“We would like to take the opportunity to thank abortion providers across Pennsylvania as they continue to provide vital healthcare services in the face of these unprecedented attacks on the right to choose, and under the additional pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” they said in the statement.

The lawmakers urged Pennsylvanians to join them in thanking abortionists, saying, “… it is crucial that we uplift abortion providers who are persevering through this political climate to provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare for their patients.”

In Pennsylvania, there were 32,123 abortions in 2020, a 3.5-percent increase from the previous year, according to state health data. Each represented a unique, valuable unborn baby whose life was unnecessarily and cruelly destroyed.

The Pennsylvania Family Institute responded to the statement with a reminder about infamous Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted of murdering three newborns and contributing to the death of a female patient, as well as numerous other crimes.

“Fellow abortion providers never reported his ‘House of Horrors,’” said Dan Bartkowiak, director of communications at the Pennsylvania Family Institute. “Even Gosnell continues to maintain his innocence. What makes Gosnell so different from other abortion mills if abortion should be unrestricted like the PA Women’s Health Caucus calls for?”

Bartkowiak told LifeNews that the caucus’s views are based on the lie that killing babies in the womb is somehow health care.

“The PA Women’s Health Caucus represents the extreme viewpoint that preborn babies can be aborted for any reason through all nine months of pregnancy and be paid for by your tax dollars,” he said. “This celebrating of abortion mills is a twisted downplay of the brutal reality of abortion yet it’s what happens when you believe the lie that the deliberate killing of preborn babies is healthcare.”

Right now, Pennsylvania abortion groups are trying to expand abortions through a lawsuit challenging a state ban on taxpayer-funded abortions. The Allegheny Reproductive Health Center and Planned Parenthood want the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to overturn the ban, force taxpayers to pay for abortions and declare abortions to be a fundamental right under the state constitution.

In response, pro-life leaders and Republican lawmakers are working to pass a state constitutional amendment that would make clear that there is no right to an abortion or taxpayer-funded abortion in the Pennsylvania Constitution. The proposed amendment must pass the legislature in two consecutive sessions and then be placed on the ballot for state voters’ approval.

Maria Gallagher, legislative director of the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, told The Epoch Times that women and babies deserve better than abortion.

“It is a sad day when people celebrate abortion, which is the taking of an innocent, unrepeatable life, and leave the woman to grieve the child,” Gallagher said. “Pregnant women deserve compassion and care, not a cold-hearted offer to abort their offspring. Safeguarding women’s health means offering them life-affirming options which protect both their health and the lives of their babies.”

She said real help is available to moms through the many pregnancy resource centers across Pennsylvania, and healing retreats through Rachel’s Vineyard offer help and healing to mothers who regret their abortions.",Q1

The defense argues in this case Larin Garcia was framed – and that evidence was planted and not thoroughly investigated.

With Palm Springs Police crime scene technician Julie Osburn back on the stand, she admitted some mistakes were made.

Osburn testified about injuries on the suspect's body that prosecutors say were consistent with rolling out of the crashed Toyota Corolla at the East Sunny Dunes Road crime scene, where three of the four victims were killed.

Processing the Corolla, Osburn said when it arrived to her, parts of the damaged car were thrown from the street into the back seat, potentially ""corrupting or contaminating"" evidence.

A tow company operator reportedly swept up other pieces of vehicle evidence from the street into a bucket, and the defense questioned about ""cross contamination.""

Asked if these were typical processes of a homicide investigation, Osburn said she ""would hope not.""

Prosecutors assert a 9mm bullet casing found in a ""baggie"" in the back of Larin Garcia's car links him to the crime, but asked by the defense, Osburn admitted neither the baggie nor the casing were tested for DNA or fingerprints.

Osburn also said a photograph of the Corolla's front driver door with a bullet hole was ""incorrectly"" described in her report.

Of a bloody jacket folded into a small paper bag, the defense argued blood could have been transferred and the jacket contaminated itself. Osburn said, ""I would have packaged it differently.""

Last week, crucial testimony was set up from ""Perkins operation"" agents – undercover officers who posed as inmates at the Banning jail the day after the murders. They were trying to obtain recorded statements from the accused murderer.

https://youtu.be/PqAZwsiLSs8

The recordings, which are reportedly hours long and in Spanish, will not be played in court. But the agents will soon take the stand, likely on Monday – with their testimony highly crucial to the case.

It could reveal if Larin Garcia incriminated himself while speaking in the jail cell.

BACKGROUND:

Jose Larin Garcia, a Cathedral City man, is accused of killing four people (ages 17-25): Carlos Campos, Jacob Montgomery, Yuliana Garcia and Juan Duarte Raya nearly three years ago.

Jose Larin Garcia, 22

The four victims were all found shot and killed on the night of February 3rd, 2019.

Three of the victims were found inside a car that crashed at Sunny Dunes and El Placer roads. The fourth victim was discovered in the street on Canon Dr. few blocks away.

When police arrived on scene, they found Larin Garcia hiding under a truck. They say he appeared intoxicated and covered in blood.

Larin Garcia was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center for treatment. Security footage shows him running away from the property later that night.

Detectives have testified he then went to a friend’s house who he had buy him a one-way bus ticket to Florida using a fake name. Prosecutors say he was preparing to flee – shaving his head and beard to change his appearance. He was arrested waiting at the bus stop.

Larin Garcia is charged with four counts of murder. He also faces a special-circumstance allegation of committing multiple murders, opening him to the death penalty if convicted.

WEEK 4 IN COURT:

In the fourth week, there was an intense debate over how Jose Larin Garcia left the hospital following the February 2019 killings.

The prosecution says Larin Garcia fled the emergency room running from police, but the defense hopes to convince the jury he was discharged.

Jurors heard from key forensic experts: a crime scene technician, a fingerprint examiner and a blood expert.

Crucial testimony was set up from undercover agents who posed as inmates and spoke with the defendant at length after the crimes.

WEEK 3 IN COURT:

The third week in this trial, jurors heard from John Olvera, the 18-year-old who the defense argues is actually responsible. Police investigated posts on his social media accounts that appeared to take credit for the murders, but Olvera testified in several instances he was publishing rap lyrics or ""fronting"" as a ""wannabe gangster.""

Department of Justice forensics specialist Nancy McCombs testified and said the multiple bullet casings that were recovered could have come from the same gun. No weapon was ever found in the investigation.

Prosecutors poked holes in testimony from one witness who changed his previous account on the stand, and Palm Springs police investigators testified about the evidence collected from the scene.https://youtube.com/embed/zyqjtgu2vhE&feature=emb_title

WEEK 2 IN COURT:

During the second week in court, the jury heard from Larin Garcia's mother, who says she received a call from her son on the night of the murders.

Two police officers who responded on the night of the murders also took the stand. One testified he saw a 'tall, thin' figure running near one of the crime scenes, but that person was never found or brought in for questioning. Larin-Garcia is not described as tall or thin. The court also heard from a family friend of Larin Garcia who helped him buy a one-way ticket to Florida the day after the murders. Larin Garcia was arrested before he could depart.

The court also heard from several witnesses including a neighbor, police detective and former friend of the accused. The friend shared that Larin Garcia had said he wanted to rob one of the victims prior to the killings.

WEEK 1 IN COURT:

The incident struck a chord with healthcare workers, who say they need better mental-health resources.","A California nurse walked off the job and was found dead two days later, local outlets reported.

The cause of Michael Odell's death has yet to be confirmed but authorities don't suspect foul play.

Nurses told Insider that Odell's death highlights their need for better mental-health resources.

Last Tuesday, neurological nurse Michael Odell walked out of the intensive care unit at Stanford Hospital, near the San Francisco Bay Area, in the middle of his shift, around 4:30 a.m.

His roommate, Joshua Christopher Paredes, said Odell told his supervisor he was leaving because he forgot something in his car. He never returned for the remainder of his shift. When the 27-year-old nurse didn't arrive at home, Paredes reported him missing, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

A Facebook group called ""Find Michael Odell"" was created to help search for him. The group, which is now private, had nearly 4,000 members.

Odell's body was found two days later on the banks of the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Fremont, California, the Stanford Daily reported.

The cause of death is unclear, but Odell's case has prompted nurses to speak out about mental health in their profession. For some, the case highlights a lack of adequate mental-health resources for healthcare professionals, especially after two years of working through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sarah Warren, a nurse in Florida, told Insider she and other nurses are frustrated ""that no one is paying attention to nurses who are struggling.""

""When he went missing, my first thought is he probably killed himself because I know it strikes the chord in so many of us, because so many of us feel so powerless. And I've had comments, I've seen other nurses who've spoken about wanting to go that route. And so I feel like so many of us resonate with it because so many of us have thought about it,"" Warren said. ""That's hard to say, but it's the reality.""

Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office told the Standford Daily that Odell's car was parked near where his body was found and footprints believed to be Odell's led into the water. Kelly said police don't believe there was any foul play involved in Odell's death.

Paredes, Odell's roommate, and another nurse told KRON4 that his death underscores the importance of having conversations about how overwhelmed nurses are by the stress of the job.

Nurses say they need more than 'Zoom yoga and self-care tips'

Warren, who has worked as a nurse since 2018, told Insider she experienced ""moral injury"" — or what others might call burnout — in her first year, but the pandemic has only exacerbated that experience.

""So my first year I was already tired of my role because of external forces, things outside of my control,"" she said.

Warren said she loves being a nurse, but her unit, like many hospitals across the country, was experiencing severe staffing shortages even before the pandemic, which have only become worse over the last two years.

""It caused me to feel like I was showing up every day and still not being able to give enough to these patients and give the care that I want to give to them because there are not enough resources,"" she said.

Even before the pandemic, several studies showed that nurses may be at a higher risk for suicidal ideation than the general population and those with suicidal ideation may be less likely to seek help.

Warren said that as the waves of COVID-19 surged, she struggled with constantly seeing death in the hospital, despite trying her best to take care of patients.

""In 2020 I experienced anxiety, depression, and was diagnosed with PTSD. I also don't remember a lot of 2020, which is strange, but it's part of how my mental health was impacted,"" Warren said.

At the end of 2020, she started therapy, but when the Delta variant caused an uptick in hospitalizations in summer 2021, Warren said therapy wasn't enough and she began taking antidepressants, which brought some temporary relief, but she began to have negative side effects, including suicidal ideation, so she tapered off.

""I just couldn't handle it anymore, and after the Delta surge, I told myself if this happens again, if we have staffing shortages that are this bad, if we have a surge like this again, I don't know if I can do it,"" Warren said.

As the Omicron variant swept through the country this December, an injury kept her out of work. Warren described it as ""divine intervention.""

Warren told Insider that hospital systems need to prioritize nurses and provide adequate staffing as well as mental-health resources. She's frustrated that help has mainly consisted of ""Zoom yoga and self-care tips,"" something she said is not proportional to the trauma nurses are experiencing.

""It's not enough. They need to invest in us. They need to invest in our emotional well-being. And for a lot of us, it's too late. The damage is already done,"" she said.

ST PAUL, Minn. — Three former Minneapolis police officers charged with depriving George Floyd of his civil rights on the day of his murder in 2020 were each found guilty on all counts Thursday in federal court.

All three officers -- J Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane -- were charged with denying Floyd his right to medical care, while Kueng and Thao also faced charges for failing to intervene with former officer Derek Chauvin's use of force.

Following Thursday's verdict, the defendants were instructed to return to court for sentencing after a pre-sentence investigation with the probation office. After it was ordered that bond be continued according to current terms and conditions, the men were then escorted out by a member of the U.S. Marshals Service.

Judge Paul Magnuson gave the jury, made up of 12 people from nine different Minnesota counties, instructions on Wednesday morning before handing off the case for deliberation. The jury, which was not sequestered, deliberated for about 13 hours before reaching its unanimous decision.

The three former officers all entered pleas of not guilty in a pre-trial hearing in September 2021.

Attorneys for the former officers relied heavily on the notion that prosecutors would need to prove the defendants acted with a bad purpose or motive in order to ""willfully"" deprive Floyd of his rights -- legal language the jury had to consider.

The prosecution's case ultimately tried to convey that the defendants knew the law, but decided not to follow it.

Some prominent figures surrounding the case started releasing statements following the verdict, including Floyd family attorney Ben Crump.

""George's blood will forever stain them,"" he said, adding, ""Nothing will bring George Floyd back to his loved ones, but with these verdicts, we hope that the ignorance and indifference toward human life shown by these officers will be erased from our nation’s police departments, so no other family has to experience a loss like this.""

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he believes the verdicts are an ""important part of the change we need,"" and that they will ""help move us forward.""

My thoughts today are with the family of George Floyd. This verdict honors Floyd’s memory. This is not a celebratory moment, but it is an important one. Once again, the principle that no one is above the law and no one is beneath it has been upheld. — Attorney General Keith Ellison (@AGEllison) February 24, 2022

In a press conference Thursday afternoon, prosecutors were joined by other investigative agencies, and supporters and members of George Floyd's family.

FBI special agent in charge for the agency's Minneapolis field office, Michael Paul, was among them. He thanked the partners in law enforcement for their ""swift investigative action.""

He also thanked the jury, saying their ""discerning ear, their diligence, and their fortitude"" helped ""bring forth a very important verdict for our country.""

Assistant U.S. Attorney LeeAnn Bell said, ""My hope and the hope of our team is that today's verdict will bring a measure of peace.""

George Floyd's brother, Philonise, said he was ""grateful"" for the team of prosecuting attorneys, calling them ""friends."" But, he said, the verdict doesn't quite bring justice.

""This is just accountability,"" he said. ""There can never be justice because I can never get George back. It’s still gonna be hard.""

Derek Chauvin, the former MPD officer convicted of Floyd's May 25, 2020 murder, was also charged in federal court with failing to render Floyd medical aid, in addition to violating his right to be ""free from unreasonable seizure and force by police.""

In December 2021, Chauvin waived his right to a trial by pleading guilty to one count of violating Floyd's rights -- in addition to a guilty plea in a separate incident involving a neck restraint used on a teenager in 2017 -- in exchange for other charges connected to those cases to be dismissed.

Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree manslaughter, second-degree murder and third-degree murder in state court in April 2021, over a year after the world watched him kneel on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, causing his death.

He was sentenced two months later to 22.5 years in state prison.

For the federal charges, Chauvin faces up to 25 years to serve concurrently with his state prison sentence.",Q1

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/its-time-to-consider-natural-immunity-to-covid-19-as-equal-to-one-shot-of-the-vaccine,Why one-shot after a Covid-19 infection should suffice to be considered fully-vaxxed | Eric Topol,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has failed to recognize that people with confirmed Covid infections, also known as “natural immunity,” have achieved some level of protection against subsequent infections and severe disease. This has unnecessarily fueled divisiveness, particularly when vaccines are mandated without acknowledgement that prior Covid is an alternate path, albeit with some limitations, for protection of the individual and helping to build the population’s immunity wall.

While there has been a body of data supporting a robust immune response to Covid infections, that evidence has recently been substantially bolstered. In the very large trial on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine single shot compared with placebo, among over 2,000 participants with prior infections, as documented by positive antibody status, their protection against moderate or severe disease was 90%. That’s much higher than the vaccine efficacy of 56%, yet the CDC recognizes 2-shot of this vaccine as “fully vaccinated” but ignores these data, and many other proof points, of natural immunity protection.

A recent CDC report for Covid in California that included the Delta wave, the cumulative hospitalization rate for the vaccinated was 0.7% among vaccinated and 0.3% unvaccinated with prior infection. Notably, a 10-fold lower risk of subsequent infection was found in the people with natural immunity compared with those vaccinated in the Cleveland Clinic health system’s study of over 52,000 employees. These reports convey a high level of protection of natural immunity, at times comparable to 2-shot vaccines. Multiple studies following people at least 15 months out from Covid infections have shown persistent antibody levels and memory B cells. Reinfections among those with natural immunity throughout the pandemic, until the recent Omicron wave, have been very low, less than 1%. A United Kingdom study of about 9,000 people with prior infections demonstrated higher than 90% protection against subsequent infections, even among those who had Covid more than 18 months previously.

If there is good protection from infections, then why is one-shot of a vaccine necessary and sufficient? A new report of nearly 150,000 people with Covid infections in Israel, with about half vaccinated, compared to the others left unvaccinated, there was an 82% lower risk of reinfection for people aged 16 to 64 years, and 60% for age 65 or older. There was no difference for the protection with more than 1-dose of vaccine. The same was found in another study. Both of these were performed during the Delta wave, but now we have data with Omicron, the strain of the virus with the most substantial evasion of our immune system. Substantiating that, In Qatar, while the protection of natural immunity was about 90% for previous Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants, it dropped to 56% for Omicron. In the United Kingdom, the risk of reinfection for people with prior Covid spiked to a level 16-fold what had been seen previously. Yet an Omicron wave study from Cleveland Clinic in about 8,000 people with natural immunity, 1-shot of vaccine markedly reduced the risk of infection and 2 or 3-shots had no incremental protective benefit. That same finding was consistent in the Israel and UK studies: 1-shot did the trick, no added protection from 2 or 3-shots. Indeed, the waning of protection after 1-year in the UK study was averted with one dose of vaccine.

Past critique of natural immunity protection is still relevant. These studies have survivor bias—they only include people who survived their infections. We know that the symptoms of Long Covid can be reduced by vaccines, which is an important added feature of the controlled vaccine approach compared with the unpredictable chronic duration sequalae of an infection, which can be disabling, even when they are mild. Although about 90% of people with infections develop antibodies and memory B an T cells, that leaves some without an immune response, which appears to be more of an issue when a person did not have symptoms, or they were very mild. Since we do not assess antibody levels, especially those capable of neutralizing of the virus, and do not measure T cell responses, there is a blind spot in knowing about an individual’s level of protection, be it by infection or vaccination.

Which brings us to hybrid immunity. It would be reckless to ever recommend someone get purposely infected with Covid. However, for those who have sustained an infection their immune response was directed to the whole virus whereas our vaccines are specific to the spike-protein. The result of combining the different immune responses is synergy, more than additive, a powerful and durable protection, 25 to 100 times more antibody response and broader against variants of the virus. Note that we do not have the same evidence for the opposite order: vaccination prior to breakthrough infections.

It is now clearly overdue for the United States and the CDC to acknowledge natural immunity as a partial path to protection, as has been previously done in several countries. The term “fully vaccinated” needs to be redefined. For people who have received 2 mRNA vaccine shots, without prior infection, a third shot, booster, is needed to protect against symptomatic and severe disease. On the other hand, for people with natural immunity, with proof of a positive PCR test, one-shot is all that is necessary to be considered “fully vaccinated.”

By providing immunity certification in this way, the polarization between natural and vaccine-induce immune camps will be bridged, at least to some extent. The evidence has become overwhelming and its adoption as policy will likely help get the low American vaccination rate of 64% , ranked worse than 60 countries in the world, to a much higher level, further building the immunity wall for the whole population.

It’s also about sticking to the science when a large and ever-increasing body of data can no longer be ignored. One can fully understand why vaccine mandates would be repudiated when there was evidence of protection conferred by infection. Now, as the virus evolved, we are at a time when natural immunity alone is not sufficient, but with a single shot it’s as good as three.",Q1
https://www.tnonline.com/20220211/homicide-trial-ends-with-guilty-pleas/,Homicide trial ends with guilty pleas – Times News Online,"Three men who were involved in an incident on July 21, 2019, in the A Pocono Country Place development that ended in a shooting death pleaded guilty in Monroe County Court in Stroudsburg on Tuesday when guilty plea agreements were reached before what was supposed to be a lengthy homicide trial.

Davaun Ewin, 20, of Newport News, Virginia, pleaded guilty to charges of third-degree murder and robbery while Shyheem Mitchell, 23, of Tobyhanna, and Nasiem Mayo, 18, of Hampton, Virginia, pleaded guilty to charges of robbery and conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter. All of the defendants were facing homicide charges.

The incident resulted in the murder of Matthew Santana, who Pocono Mountain Regional Police said was shot several times. Police said when they were dispatched to Winter Drive and Pembrook Drive in Coolbaugh Township, they found a Honda sedan in a ditch and Santana in it, slumped over the steering wheel of the vehicle.

Following the pleas, Judge David Williamson accepted the recommended sentences of 5 to 15 years in prison for Mitchell; 6 to 15 years in prison for Mayo; and 10 to 40 years in prison for Ewin. Although Ewin would be eligible for parole once he serves his 10 year minimum, most homicide offenders will serve over half of their minimum sentences before being paroled.

Police said the shooting resulted after the three defendants, each armed with handguns, stole a bottle of Hennessey whiskey from Santana and Angel Rodriguez and Jonathan Nazario as the trio were at an outdoor pavilion smoking marijuana, drinking the whiskey and playing music loudly.

Officials said a confrontation followed after Santana, Rodriguez and Nazario drove to a residence on Winter Drive, which they said was affiliated with the men who robbed them. When the vehicle came under gunfire, Santana was struck and became unresponsive, while Rodriguez and Nazario fled the scene.

Detectives said Santana’s vehicle was struck at least twice, and they also found evidence of other bullet rounds entering the passenger compartment.

Officers searched the Winter Drive property and found spent .357 SIG and 9 mm casings in the driveway, in addition to live 9 mm rounds in the home belonging to Mayo.

Santana’s cause of death was determined to be gunshot wounds to the head and torso.

Another search warrant at a residence on Greenbriar Circle resulted in two handguns, a Glock .357 SIG and a Ruger 9 mm pistol, tied up in a black garbage bag and hidden under a tarp. The Glock was reported stolen in 2017 by the Virginia Beach Police Department.

Investigators said Ewin fired the shots that hit Santana. Malik Pruitt, 18, of Albrightsville, who police said gave false statements to police and provided a false alibi for Mitchell, was also charged as a principal and accomplice to robbery but was not involved in the court proceedings this week.

Before the sentencings, Judge Williamson read a letter written by the victim’s mother that was presented by sentencing First Assistant District Attorney Michael Mancuso. Mrs. Santana opted not to speak at the sentencing, but in her letter, she stated the deceased was her only child and the impact of the crime on her “was terrible.”

Afterward, Mancuso praised the work of the Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department and Assistant District Attorney Rich White and Detective Sgt. Wendy Serfass of the DA’s office for their work in bringing the case to justice.

The Drug and Device Law Dowager Countess blushes and giggles at the mention of Jackman, and the outing seemed a worthy one, not without apparent urgency given time’s ravages (the Countess is well into her 88th year). But here’s the problem: opening night has been postponed three times for COVID, and previews recently paused to allow both leads (Marian the Librarian is played by the exquisite Sutton Foster) to recover from bouts of the omicron variant. By all appearances, the train is back on the rails. Previews are proceeding apace. Opening night is a week away. Just before setting fingers to keyboard for this post, we made pre-show dinner reservations at a lovely Italian restaurant on the same block as the theatre. And now we wait, with bated breath, to see which way the pendulum swings. Think good thoughts for us.

We like the way the pendulum swung in today’s case, the latest in a recent series of “which side are you on” decisions out of Pennsylvania’s federal district courts, predicting whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will hold that comment k to Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts bars strict liability claims against manufacturers of prescription medical devices. We have followed these cases with great interest (you can see some of our previous posts here and here and here and here and here and here) and with a healthy dose of eye-rolling incredulity. As we have emphasized, there is only one correct answer, as there is no colorable basis for a straight-faced distinction between prescription drugs and prescription medical devices.

We step back, briefly, for those not similarly obsessed with this jurisprudential seesaw. By its terms, comment k bars strict liability claims against manufacturers of “unavoidably unsafe products,” explicitly including prescription drugs. The comment does not address prescription medical devices, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not yet decided this issue. Nor, we emphasize again, should it have to. As decades of federal and state court decisions held before the current wobble, the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s Creazzo decision was correct in predicting that the Supreme Court would reach the only logical result. (Regular readers may recall that the Third Circuit certified this question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but the case was settled before the Court had a chance to rule.)

Today’s case, McDonnell v. Flowonix Med., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12916 (E.D. Pa. Jan 25, 2022) represents another egg in the basket of all that is sensible. (Well, almost all – the decision includes a couple of stumbles not related to the comment k issue. Stay tuned.) In McDonnell, the plaintiff’s serious spinal disease caused her to suffer “chronic and intractable back pain.” McDonnell, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12916 at *2. She was implanted with the defendant’s infusion pump, which was supposed to “release pain medication in a semi-autonomous way through software programs.” Id. at *1. The plaintiff alleged that the pump malfunctioned, causing her to suffer severe injuries that included physical pain, mental pain, and morphine withdrawal. (She was comatose and ventilator-dependent for several days, according to the complaint.) She asserted claims for negligence, strict liability, braches of express and implied warranties, and fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. In addition, although the complaint did not include a separate claim for loss of consortium, it alleged facts about injuries the plaintiff’s husband allegedly suffered. The defendant moved to dismiss all claims except negligence.

Strict Liability and Breach of Warranty

The court wasted little time in reaching the correct holding on this claim. As the court explained, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court adopted comment k in 1996 in Hahn v. Richter, holding that comment k “denies the application of strict liability on products such as prescription drugs, which, although dangerous in that they are not without medical risks, are not deemed defective and unreasonably dangerous when marketed with proper warnings.” Id., at *13 (internal punctuation and citation to Hahn omitted). Ten years later, in Creazzo, the Superior Court “found no reason why the same rational[e] applicable to prescription drugs may not be applied to medical devices.” Id. (internal punctuation and citation omitted). The court then cited all of the recent district court decisions going the right way and ignored all of the decisions inexplicably reaching opposite conclusion. The court concluded, “Considering the decisions of courts in this Circuit and of the lower courts of Pennsylvania, this Court predicts the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will extend comment k to prescription medical devices. Thus, Plaintiffs’ strict liability claim must be dismissed.” Id. (Duh.) The court also dismissed the breach of express warranty claim because the plaintiff failed “to plead any express language used to create an express warranty at all,” and it dismissed the implied warranty claim because, under the Superior Court’s 1987 Makripodis decision, comment k also bars implied warranty claims because “the very nature of prescription drugs themselves precludes the imposition” of an implied warranty of fitness for ordinary purposes. Id. at *18 (citation omitted).

“Doug” and Loss of Consortium

As we mentioned, it’s not all good. The plaintiff alleged that an agent of the defendant, identified only as “Doug” stated that the plaintiff’s pump was filled with medication and was releasing medication, when, according to the plaintiff, the pump was not functioning. The defendant argued that these allegations were not adequate to plead fraudulent misrepresentation under Pennsylvania law. The court explained that, to establish an agency relationship, the plaintiff was required to “identify the agent by name or appropriate description.” Id. at *10 (citation omitted). The court held, “Although the Amended Complaint does not give more details as to “Doug’s” last name or title, this Court finds that it sufficiently pled enough facts to survive a Motion to Dismiss. . . . Plaintiff’s ability to provide a name for the agent and the . . . examination date of the Pump satisfies [Twiqbal’s] pleading requirements.” Id. at *10-11. The same reasoning saved the negligent misrepresentation claim. We question both holdings, along with the court’s holding that the plaintiff had adequately pled a loss of consortium claim even though she didn’t plead a loss of consortium claim.

But we quibble. At some point, presumably, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will address the comment k issue. We are grateful for McDonnell’s weight on the correct side of that scale. We will continue to keep you posted. In the meantime, stay safe out there, especially as more nasty weather threatens the eastern U.S.",Q1

Kathryn “Katie” Newhouse, 19, was killed on 19 March, according to officers at Cherokee County Police who found both her and her father, Howard Newhouse, 57, dead in their home.

According to Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents, who wrote a blog post about Newhouse’s death, the teen was a “Minecraft and UberSpire enthusiast, an advocate for trans rights” and “had a bright smile”.

The blog post continued: “A native of Illinois, Kathryn was most recently living with her family in Canton, Georgia.

“Kathryn was a Minecraft and UberSpire enthusiast, an advocate for trans rights, had a bright smile, enjoyed changing up her hairstyles, and attentive to world events.”

“She enjoyed hiking and sightseeing. She was proud of her AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] heritage; she was of Filipino heritage… “Kathryn’s death is a horrific tragedy and she deserves to still be here with us.”

Newhouse’s brother Chris explained to CBS46 news that his sister was autistic and had lived with mental health issues.

“A tragic culmination of all of these different mental health issues that kind of compounded and led to such a, escalated to a situation that – it shouldn’t have happened, but it happened,” he said.

At least six other trans, non-binary and gender-conforming people have been violently killed in the US in 2022 so far, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which has been monitoring the wave of brutality since 2013.

It comes after last year’s record-breaking death tally of at least 57, many of them Black trans women. The record continues to climb even months after the year’s end, as more victims’ deaths are discovered by grassroots activists combing through local news reports and talking to relatives.

HRC said in a statement: “HRC works to shed light on this epidemic of violence in order to ensure victims’ lives are remembered with dignity, and to work to end the stigma that so many trans and gender non-conforming people face…

“While the details of these cases differ, it is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of colour – particularly Black transgender women – and that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and unchecked access to guns conspire to deprive them of employment, housing, healthcare and other necessities.”

The exhibit — “Honor, Courage, Commitment: Marine Corps Art 1975-2018"" — contains 36 pieces of art by combat artists over four decades. There are 15 combat artists who will be showcased during the exhibit's time in St. George. The exhibit will be available to view until April 30.

“It's invaluable to this community to have a show like this, especially because we have a decent veteran community here in southern Utah. And just to network with folks in D.C., it just kind of puts this art museum on the map,” St. George Art Museum administrator Natalie Gula said.

“It's important, particularly for us as the Marine Corps League. We're Marines in this area, and the visibility helps us, particularly when we do Toys for Tots and other charity efforts, which is a major part of our existence,” Dixie Marine Corps League member Bill Fortune said.

The Dixie Marine Corps League is one of the largest Marine groups in Utah and helps local charities and provides assistance to veterans.

“The Marine Corps has a special program that recruits and pulls in these guys. As you can see, it's good work. And it telegraphs something nobody else would tell you, the Army won't tell you this, the Navy won't tell you this. It has to be Marines that had this experience that will tell you this,” Fortune said.

Charles Grove, one of the combat artists featured, will be at the St. George Art Museum on March 16 from 7 to 8 p.m. for the monthly Art Conversation event.

https://tass.com/world/1402973,US puts pressure on some countries under pretext of anti-drug crusade — Russian diplomat,"MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. The United States uses the issue of combating drugs to exert political pressure on Venezuela, Bolivia, Iran and Syria, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov told a roundtable in the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house of parliament.

""We see a trend towards increasing politicization of drug problems. Western countries are making attempts to use anti-drug themes to put political pressure on Venezuela, Bolivia, Iran and Syria. It is noteworthy that the term of ""narcoterrorism"" is included in the American legislation, which allows Washington under pretext of combating this threat to use all its tools in its fight against these countries,"" the deputy foreign minister said.

The diplomat stressed that the drug threat remains an acute challenge today, and ""the drug criminal uses increasingly sophisticated measures for the distribution of prohibited substances,"" quickly adapting to new conditions, which became especially noticeable during the pandemic. Among the latest dangerous trends, he also named the rapid growth of the production of methamphetamine and cannabis ""in Afghanistan, the global opiate lab"".

""Calls for legalizing drugs for medical use are sounding louder and louder. The drug-liberal countries are simply on the offensive in the process of UN conferences on this topic,"" the deputy minister said. According to him, these countries have recently presented a united front at these events. Syromolotov drew attention to the liberalization of legislation in this regard in the US, Canada and Mexico.",Q1
https://aish.com/why-is-israel-one-of-the-top-10-happiest-countries-in-the-world/,Why Is Israel One of the Top 10 Happiest Countries in the World?,"This week four Israelis were killed and several others were injured, in a terrorist stabbing attack at a shopping center and gas station in Be’er Sheva. Beautiful, innocent souls were murdered in cold blood, reminding us yet again how our brothers and sisters in Israel live with constant threats and dangers.

One would think a country whose citizens face terror regularly and are surrounded by hostile enemies who seek their extermination would be paralyzed by fear and would be debilitated by distress. Instead, despite the daily dangers, Israelis are remarkably happy.

At number 9, Israelis are happier than Canadians (15), Americans (16) and the people of the United Kingdom (17).

According to this year’s World Happiness Report that was just released, Israel has climbed to its highest ranking yet, breaking into the top 10 happiest countries in the world. Finland came in first for the fifth year in a row, while Afghanistan placed last at No. 146. At number 9, Israelis are happier than Canadians (15), Americans (16) and the people of the United Kingdom (17).

When the Founding Fathers included the “pursuit of happiness” as an American right, it’s almost as if there was an inherent concession that happiness can be pursued, but it is hard to ever attain. For many, that pursuit has grown tiring and indeed, they have given up. In 2006, Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert wrote a book called “Stumbling on Happiness.” In it, he argues that the things and experiences we typically predict and imagine will bring us happiness rarely do. Rather, he says, happiness is elusive, and while there are efforts we can make, our best bet is to hope to stumble upon it.

Judaism disagrees. Happiness, simcha, is not something that we stumble or trip upon by accident. It’s the result of a conscious decision, a determined attitude. In Path of the Just, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto writes that being happy and joyful is not a luxury or simply preferable; they are critical components of a meaningful life.

Power of Smiling

We tend to think that when we are happy we smile, but it turns out to be the opposite. Science has shown that the mere act of smiling, engaging the micro muscles involved, can lift your mood, lower stress, boost your immune system, and even prolong your life. When you smile, your brain releases neuropeptides to help fight stress. Dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins are released that relieve pain and bring pleasure.

As a result, choosing to smile is choosing happiness, not only for you but for the people around you. Nicholas Christakis, a professor at Harvard Medical School, found that misery is not alone in liking company; happiness is also contagious. Knowing someone who is happy makes you 15.3% more likely to be happy yourself. A happy friend of a friend increases your odds of happiness by 9.8%, and even your neighbor’s sister’s friend can give you a 5.6% boost.

Happiness occurs when we make the decision to focus on the blessings in our lives, no matter how challenging or formidable the struggles we face

Happiness occurs when we make the decision to focus on the blessings in our lives, no matter how challenging or formidable the struggles we face. If our happiness results from the blessings we already have, we can always find happiness, because we always have at least something. But if our happiness is determined by what we don’t have — “If only I had more money, a nicer house, a better job, a more loving spouse, more loyal children” — we will never be happy because we can always have more and therefore by definition there will always be something we don’t have.

In a recent class, I challenged everyone to make the conscious effort to smile more, even—or especially—when we don’t feel like it. Smile before walking into the house. Smile when the children come into the car at carpool. Smile when greeting your family at the end of the day. Be intentional, create the habit and routine of smiling in the moments that will create the mood and introduce the energy.

People told me how it changed their lives.

Don’t believe me – try it yourself.

Don’t stumble on happiness, choose it by smiling more.",Q1

https://news.yahoo.com/editorial-deputies-shot-autistic-man-130056234.html,"Editorial: Deputies shot an autistic man, then the justice system terrorized him. There's a better way.","Isaias Cervantes had become agitated and began shoving his mother. Autistic and deaf, and dealing with anxiety and possibly intellectual disabilities, the 25-year-old man was generally calm but could occasionally become difficult. His sister called 911 and asked that someone come to the house in Cudahy and take her brother to the hospital.

It was March 31, 2021. When two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies arrived, Cervantes' mother and sister went outside to speak with them. They and Cervantes' therapist, who was at the home at the time, tried to assure the deputies that the young man, sitting calmly and quietly in the living room, was not a threat.

When Cervantes declined to come outside, the deputies entered the home. One of them told Cervantes that they were there to help him and that he was not under arrest — indeed, no one at any point had accused him of committing a crime — but that, for reasons unstated, they had no choice but to handcuff him.

Then they grabbed him. Cervantes tried to avoid the grasp, and in an audio recording of the incident (no video is available because both deputies' body cameras fell off), one deputy is heard saying, ""He's going for my gun."" The other deputy then shot Cervantes.

The bullet damaged his spine and one of his lungs. He underwent multiple surgeries and spent months in physical rehabilitation. In addition to his previous disabilities, Cervantes is now paralyzed.

Cervantes’ story is horrifying but unfortunately not unique. Families doing their best to care for loved ones with special needs or who process information differently than the majority of people must on occasion seek emergency help, and they call 911. Sometimes, instead of the help and expertise they expected, they get officers who escalate rather than calm the situation. They get excessive and unnecessary force, injury and death.

Examples are not hard to come by. Eric Briceno’s mother called 911 when her son was having a mental health crisis in 2020. L.A. County sheriff’s deputies responded to their Maywood home — and beat and tasered the 39-year-old man to death.

Last year, David Ordaz Jr. was having a mental health crisis, and the family called for help. Sheriff’s deputies responded — and shot the 34-year-old-man to death.

The Cervantes case is perhaps unusual in that the young man survived the encounter. But that opened the door to further traumas. Sheriff’s deputies blocked the family from seeing Cervantes in the hospital, and repeatedly came to the house in the aftermath, ostensibly to investigate the incident. But the family saw it as intimidation, especially after they sued the department over the shooting.

And then, nearly seven months later, the Sheriff's Department asked the district attorney to file criminal charges — against Cervantes: Assault with a deadly weapon on a law enforcement officer (allegedly one deputy's own weapon) and two counts of resisting arrest (although there had been no arrest) with force.

After being notified of the details of incident by disability advocates, the district attorney’s office, to its credit (although rather late in the process), notified Cervantes’ attorney last week that it would not pursue the charges, and that Cervantes need not appear for the hearing given ""the totality of the circumstances,"" according to a spokesman for Dist. Atty. George Gascón. Charges are pending against one of the deputies involved (Jonathan Miramontes) for falsifying records in another case.

The Cervantes case, and others like it, show why we need “alternative crisis response” — a set of protocols and programs that dispatch behavioral health experts and clinicians to handle mental health crises rather than armed law enforcement officers. A nationwide call for such services grew amid protests in the wake of George Floyd's murder in 2020, and state and local governments have studied various approaches. Beginning this July, a nationwide mental health crisis number — 988 — is supposed to provide an alternative to 911 and provide more appropriate responses. County Supervisor Janice Hahn launched the effort to build a Los Angeles County response system of integrated services.

But if they are to meet the deadline, state and local agencies have to move faster. In California, AB 988 — known as the Miles Hall Act, in memory of yet another man killed by police responding to a mental health call — has yet to pass.

Many law enforcement agencies argue that they already have some form of alternative response protocols. The Sheriff’s Department, for example, has had Mental Evaluation Teams to send health clinicians along with sheriff’s deputies since 1993.

But no MET responded to the Cervantes family’s call. There is little value in alternative programs if they are not used.

Because of the looming 988 deadline, 2022 will likely be a pivotal year for alternative crisis response, in Los Angeles, California and around the nation. We’ve seen, in the examples of Isaias Cervantes and others, how badly things can go wrong. It’s time now to make sure they start going right.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-aide-stephen-miller-thursday-date-jan-6-committee-rcna24419,Trump aide Stephen Miller meets with Jan. 6 committee for more than 8 hours,"WASHINGTON — Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to then-President Donald Trump, testified virtually Thursday for more than 8 hours before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

When he was subpoenaed in November, the committee wrote that Miller ""participated in efforts to spread false information about alleged voter fraud in the November 2020 election, as well as efforts to encourage state legislatures to alter the outcome of the November 2020 election by appointing alternate slates of electors.""

On Thursday, Miller pushed back on the committee at points during his deposition, according to a person who was present. He was “pugnacious” and “cooperative-ish,” this person said.

In particular, Miller refuted allegations that Trump's Jan. 6 speech contained coded language intended to instigate violence and argued with the committee on the topic of voter fraud, according to a person familiar with his testimony. His lawyers also asserted executive privilege several time, this person said.

A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee declined to comment. Miller declined NBC News's request to make a statement about his deposition.

Miller filed suit in federal court last month to block the committee from gaining access to his records.

In December, The New York Times reported that Miller was involved in post-election strategy sessions at Trump's campaign headquarters in which political and government officials decided to push the lie that the election was rigged and file lawsuits to back up allegations of fraud.

During the session, a bill authorizing helium extraction agreements may be a main topic.

January is National Human Trafficking Prevention Month and Delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty is organizing the walk in Window Rock, Arizona to bring attention to the problem and to remember missing and murdered Diné relatives.

The winter session is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. and will be held in hybrid format because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaker Seth Damon is sponsoring a bill to authorize operating agreements for helium development by the Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Company.

The company, a tribal enterprise, is seeking authorization to examine helium extraction activities within the chapters of Sanostee, Red Valley and Teec Nos Pos.

When the bill went before the Naa'bik'íyáti' Committee in January, Damon told delegates that the project would financially help the tribe.

Opponents say while company officials have met with Sanostee Chapter leadership, individuals who hold grazing and land permits have not been consulted or have consented to the development.

Some delegates during the committee commented about the lack of consideration for community members.

A forum for community members to discuss the proposal with Damon and company officials was scheduled for Jan. 23 at the Sanostee Chapter house.

Prior to the forum, a group called Dooda (No) Helium Extraction Organization is scheduled to host a meeting outside the chapter house at 11 a.m.

Another environment-related bill proposes waiving part of the tribe's sovereign immunity so it can participate in California's cap-and-trade program, a key element to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state.

Cap-and-trade systems are one of several market-based ways to reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.

The tribe would join in the program through the Navajo Forestry Department, whose director wrote in a letter to tribal leaders that participation would generate revenue for the tribe by selling emission credits.

If tribal leaders authorize participation in the program, then the tribe would be under the legal jurisdiction of California state courts for matters related to the program.

Another piece of legislation proposes changing the date when voter registration closes for tribal elections.

Such action would alleviate problems for the Navajo Election Administration because it would create a gap between when voter registration closes and absentee voting begins, the bill states.

There are 11 bills on the proposed agenda, which is on the council's website.

Additional bills can be added by delegates when the adoption of the agenda occurs, according to the Office of Legislative Services.

They then entered the basement through a window to find eight mentally and physically disabled people located in the basement, CBS 46 Atlanta reported.

Both Curtis Keith Bankston and his wife, Sophia Simms-Bankston had been leasing the residence for over a year and were using it as an unlicensed facility under the guise of the church, One Step of Faith Ministries based in Atlanta.

Police say the couple falsely imprisoned the individuals and controlled their finances, benefits and medications, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. In some instances individuals were denied proper medical care.

Griffin Police told Fox 5 Atlanta, “It is both frightening and disgusting to see the degree to which these individuals have been taken advantage of by people who were in a position of trust.”

His attorney, Dexter Wimbush stated “I am disturbed by this continual attack on Black men in America. It is unfortunate that the news media will highlight the wrongs that Black men do. But there seems to be this intentional plan to eradicate even the Black men in this country who are doing the right thing.”

Big Blue announced on Monday that LzLabs was “repeatedly infringing upon company patents protecting various aspects of IBM’s high-performance mainframe systems, a core technology that clients depend on for their most important workloads.”

Although mainframes are considered by some to be legacy tech, it has not stopped legal action previously.

Neon Systems

In 2009 for example, Neon Enterprise Software, an Austin, Texas company that made software designed to shift mainframe workloads onto cheaper speciality processors, sued IBM, alleging Big Blue was using anticompetitive tactics.

IBM came back and countersued Neon in January of 2010 for unfair business practices and anticompetitive behaviour of its own, namely copyright violation.

Neon then amended its complaint in February 2010 sharing more specific details of IBM’s alleged anticompetitive behaviour.

Want to know more about the mainframe? Try our Tales In Tech History article.

Both parties settled the dispute in June 2011, with Neon immediately withdrawing its zPrime product from the market, and certain key staff members were banned from reverse engineering, reverse compiling or translating specific IBM software.

No payments made by either side.

LzLabs sued

Fast forward eleven years and IBM has now filed its lawsuit against LzLabs, founded in Switzerland in 2011, in the US District Court in Waco, Texas.

LzLabs offers a platform called Software Defined Mainframe (SDM).

SDM is designed to help IBM mainframe users migrate their applications to a modern platform (i.e. a cluster of x86 servers or the cloud), without having to modify the applications or the associated data.

In the complaint IBM alleges that LzLabs has deliberately misappropriated IBM trade secrets by reverse engineering, reverse compiling and translating IBM software.

IBM also alleges that LzLabs has made false and misleading claims about LzLabs’ products.

As a result, IBM said it is seeking relief that includes an injunction against LzLabs to prevent further unlawful use of IBM’s intellectual property and trade secrets.

Neon link

And IBM was keen to stress the link between LzLabs and Neon Enterprise Software.

IBM in its complaint alleged that LzLabs is owned and run by some of the same individuals who previously owned and ran Neon Enterprise Software.

IBM alleged that Neon “previously attempted to free ride on IBM’s mainframe business, and prior litigation between IBM and Neon ended with a US District Court permanently barring Neon and certain of its key employees from, among other things, reverse engineering, reverse compiling and translating certain IBM software, and also from continuing to distribute certain Neon software products.”

IBM said it has made “significant investment in research and development in this critical technology field and will aggressively defend its investments and resulting patents against those who violate them, as LzLabs has now repeatedly done.”

It said the IBM patents infringed by LzLabs include:

Two that describe methods embodied in IBM mainframe instructions that LzLabs must emulate with or translate into Intel x86 instructions,

Two that describe methods of increasing emulation/translation efficiency that LzLabs must implement if it is to achieve optimized performance objectives; and

One that describes a method related to the translation of IBM mainframe applications wherein IBM programs called by those applications are identified and an x86 substituted for each.

In a decision that could dramatically undercut President Biden’s ambitious climate goals, the Commerce Department said Monday that it is investigating whether imports of solar panels from Southeast Asia are circumventing anti-dumping rules that limit imports from China.

Clean energy leaders said the investigation — which could result in retroactive tariffs as high as 240% — would severely hinder the U.S. solar industry, leading to thousands of layoffs and imperiling as many as 80% of the planned solar projects in the U.S. Such an outcome would jeopardize one of Biden’s top clean energy goals and run counter to his administration’s push for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

The Commerce Department decision “signals that the Biden administration’s talk of supporting solar energy is empty rhetoric,” said Heather Zichal, chief executive of the American Clean Power Assn., a clean energy group.

Zichal, who was White House energy advisor under President Obama, called on Biden to reverse the decision immediately. “America’s solar workers and the clean energy community are watching and will remember,” she said, calling implications of the investigation “apocalyptic” for the industry.

“Overnight, the Commerce Department ... drove a stake through the heart of planned solar projects and choked off up to 80% of the solar panel supply to the U.S.,” she said, adding that Biden ”must fix this now.”

The Commerce investigation comes after a complaint by Auxin Solar, a small California-based manufacturer, that said solar panels assembled in four Southeast Asian nations — Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam — are circumventing rules intended to block imports of solar cells and panels from China.

The White House declined to comment, but a Commerce Department spokesman said the agency will “conduct an open and transparent investigation to determine whether circumvention” of U.S. trade law is occurring. “This inquiry is just a first step ... and no additional duties will be imposed at this time,″ spokesman Jeremy Edwards said.

Auxin Solar CEO Mamun Rashid said he was grateful that Commerce officials recognized the need to investigate what he called the “pervasive backdoor dumping” of solar panels by China. Solar manufacturers in smaller Asian countries use parts produced by Chinese companies as a way to keep costs down while skirting steep anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs on Chinese goods, he said.

“For years, Chinese solar producers have refused to fairly price their products in the U.S. and have gone to significant lengths to continue undercutting American manufacturers and workers by establishing ... operations in countries not covered by those duties,’’ Rashid said. “Fair trade and enforcement of our trade laws are essential to rebuilding the American solar supply chain and making solar [panels] in America again.”

The Commerce Department action comes weeks after Biden extended tariffs imposed by former President Trump on most solar panels imported from China and other countries. In a nod to his efforts to combat climate change and boost clean energy, Biden excluded tariffs on some panels used in large-scale utility projects.

Biden’s Feb. 4 announcement continued many Trump-era tariffs, but he exempted so-called bifacial solar panels that can generate electricity on both sides and are now used in many large solar projects. The technology was still emerging when the tariffs were first imposed by Trump.

Biden also doubled an import quota on solar cells — the main components of panels that go on rooftops and utility sites — to 5 gigawatts, allowing a greater number of imported cells used by domestic manufacturers.

Biden faced a choice among competing constituencies on solar power, a key part of his climate and clean energy agenda. Labor unions support import restrictions to protect domestic jobs, while the solar industry relies in large part on cheap panels imported from Asia.

In a speech this month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the U.S. must boost domestic manufacturing of products such as solar panels.

“The more we rely on other countries to make things for us, the more vulnerable we become to supply chain disruptions like we have seen over the past two years,” she said March 15, adding that “at least 95% of the market for the cells that go into solar panels is estimated to have components that were produced in China.”

Biden has set a goal to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and solar power is a key part of that agenda. A report last year by the Energy Department said solar has the potential to supply as much as 40% of the nation’s electricity within 15 years — a tenfold increase over current solar output.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Assn., which represents solar installers, called the Commerce Department investigation a “misstep” that could have a devastating effect on the U.S. solar market and result in tens of thousands of layoffs. The decision could result in retroactive tariffs as high as 240%, a possibility Hopper said would have an immediate and “chilling effect on the solar industry.”

Additional tariffs could cause the loss of 70,000 American jobs, including 11,000 manufacturing jobs, she said, and could result in a dramatic drop in solar installations and a corresponding increase in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

“Solar prices are increasing, federal climate legislation is stalled and trade restrictions are now compounding,” Hopper said. “Commerce should quickly end this investigation to mitigate the harm it will cause for American workers and our nation’s efforts to tackle climate change.”

Trump approved tariffs on imported solar energy components in 2018, saying his administration would always defend American workers and businesses from unfair competition. The tariffs were initially set at 30% and later cut to 18% and then 15%. They were set to expire without action by Biden.

Under Biden’s decision, tariffs will be set at 14.75% and gradually reduced to 14%.

Since the tariffs were imposed, solar-panel production in the U.S. has tripled. Chinese and South Korean companies have set up factories in Georgia, Florida and Alabama, and an American firm, First Solar Inc., expanded domestic production at a plant in Ohio.",Q1

The next morning, Vicha Ratanapakdee was assaulted while on a walk in San Francisco and died, becoming yet another Asian victim of violence in America.

On Sunday, Monthanus Ratanapakdee marked the one-year anniversary of her father’s death with a rally in the San Francisco neighborhood where the 84-year-old was killed. She was joined by San Francisco Mayor London Breed, local leaders and several hundred people who came out to say they would stay silent no more.

“It’s been traumatizing to see this again and again happen to people who look like you,” said Natassia Kwan, an attorney and rally organizer. “Today, we’re going to say it’s not okay for our elders and women to be pushed into subway tracks, to be killed, to be beaten. We deserve better.”

Hundreds of people in five other U.S. cities joined in the national event, all of them seeking justice for Asian Americans who have been harassed, assaulted, and even killed in alarming numbers since the start of the pandemic.

Ratanapakdee, who was raised in Thailand, feels compelled to speak out so people don’t forget the gentle, bespectacled man who doted on his young grandsons and encouraged her to pursue her education in America.

“I really want my father’s death to not be in vain,” said Ratanapakdee, 49, a food safety inspector with the San Francisco Unified School District. “I wouldn’t want anyone to feel this pain.”

The Senate Standing Committee on Aviation summoned on Thursday the establishment secretary along with relevant record after a member raised objection to the appointment of the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

During a meeting, chaired by Senator Hidayatullah, the committee was informed that the ban imposed on the Pakistani airlines by the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom were expected to be lifted in three months.

Naseebullah Bazai objected that the appointment of the CAA DG Khaqan Murtaza was not made accordance with the law. He said that according to the record, Khaqan Murtaza did not serve in the “hard areas” – Gilgit-Baltistan and Balochistan.

He added that the service rules suggested that he should have been posted in hard areas for two years before his appointment as the DG. Murtaza replied that his appointment was in accordance with the law, and asked the senator, if he had any objection, he could call the establishment secretary.

This led to heated exchanges between Senator Bazai and Khaqan Murtaza. However, the chair resolved the matter by summoning the establishment division secretary along with the record of the appointment of the CAA DG.

Later, the aviation secretary told the committee that the sanctions imposed by the EU and the UK were likely to be lifted in three months. He said that the European Commission (EC) and the UK authorities had raised nine objections related to the security paradigm.

A nine-member team of the International Civil Aviation Organisations (ICAO) conducted a rigorous audit of the civil aviation. The ICAO audit asked 900 questions about civil aviation protocols and cleared Pakistan in the audit, the secretary said.

He said that more talks were under way with the European Commission, adding that a meeting with the UK authorities was scheduled for February 1, while another meeting with the European Commission was also on the cards. After the meetings, the private airlines would be allowed to fly to Europe, he said.

The committee chairman said that the attitude of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials at the airports was not appropriate and they had been receiving a lots of complaints in this regard. He asked whether there was any training for the FIA personnel at the airports.

The CAA DG told the committee that FIA had been given 30 counters at the airports but out of them only seven of were manned by the FIA personnel. The chair decided to summon the FIA officials to the next meeting.

Another committee member, Saleem Mandviwala, pointed out the presence of a number of out-of-order planes at Karachi Airport. Karachi Airport had become a junkyard, the senator told the committee. This junk must be thrown away somewhere else, he added.",Q1
https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-capitol-attack-anniversary-analysis-1.6303070,American democracy had near-death experience a year ago. This year will test its vital signs,"American democracy had a near-death experience one year ago this week. There's no sign, a year later, that it's served as a habit-changing wake-up call.

The prognosis is bleaker yet.

Even this solemn anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol underscores the inability of the country's warring political tribes to set aside their loathing and inhabit a common reality for just one day.

There are opposing vigils. Democrats will mark the occasion with candlelight events; right-wing activists are holding vigils to honour the jailed attackers, calling them political prisoners.

Here's the key part: This is no fringe view. A new poll says most Republicans feel the rioters were defending democracy; on crowdfunding pages, millions of dollars in donations have flowed to cover the rioters' legal fees.

And the man who tried stealing a presidential election, who encouraged that mob, was scheduled to hold his own Jan. 6 event — but announced on Tuesday that he had cancelled it.

Donald Trump, shown at his Florida estate in 2016, will hold his own event to commemorate Jan. 6. The former president, who lost the November 2020 election to Biden, remains unrepentant about the violent events of last January. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)

Donald Trump remains the de facto leader of the Republican Party, a hero to its voters, and he had planned mark Jan. 6 by repeating conspiracy theories about his election loss on Nov. 3, 2020.

Election norms are being rewritten. In one state after another, non-partisan election officials have needed police protection after fielding hundreds of threats .

Now their control of elections is under threat: Republican politicians in several states want their legislatures to claim power in declaring election winners.

""It's a constant barrage of attacks,"" said Ann Jacobs, a Democrat who currently heads Wisconsin's bipartisan — and increasingly embattled — election commission.

""A constant repetition of false claims [about 2020].... We still get people calling and hollering.""

'We were insufficiently alarmist'

An academic who co-authored the book How Democracies Die now says he was too optimistic when he wrote it in 2018, as the U.S. has blown past the warning signs flagged there.

""I think we were insufficiently alarmist,"" said Harvard professor and author Steve Levitsky , a scholar of democratic decline.

What troubles him, he says, isn't so much Trump — he never expected the former president to play by normal democratic rules, but he did expect stronger opposition to Trump's antics from other Republicans.

WATCH | How the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol HiIl riot could happen again : What’s been learned about the Capitol Hill riot and why it could happen again Duration 5:27 A year after rioters stormed Capitol Hill, official and unofficial investigations reveal more about who was involved in the attack and why some experts believe similar violence could happen again.

Now Levitsky says he's terrified about 2024. If the conditions align, he says, we could easily witness a stolen election and the end of American democracy as we know it.

""2024 is a coin flip,"" Levitsky said. ""We are a coin flip away from losing our democracy.""

Multiple public opinion polls paint a consistent portrait about the risks to American democracy, and here are two examples.

An NPR/PBS/Marist survey in November found that only 33 per cent of Republicans will trust the 2024 election result if their candidate loses, versus 82 per cent of Democrats.

Another survey offers a warning sign. Washington Post polling over time has found a steady increase in people saying violence against the government can be justified, with 40 per cent of Republicans and 23 per cent of Democrats now feeling that way.

If last year was the near-death experience, this year will allow us to check back in and test the republic's vital signs.

3 questions for 2022

We could soon have answers to three questions about 2024, provided in part by the Nov. 8, 2022, midterm elections:

1. Who do Republicans nominate? Republicans will hold primary contests this spring and summer to decide which candidates should represent them. In this election, elections are an issue. In Georgia , Michigan , Wyoming , Arizona and elsewhere, voters will choose between more traditional conservatives and far-right figures repeating Trump's election lies.

2. Who controls the swing states? On Nov. 8, Republicans are heavily favoured to regain at least one chamber in the U.S. Congress. But an arguably more important story will unfold at the state level. In the states, winning in 2022 means more control over the process in 2024. Virtually every presidential swing state has an election this year to decide the governor or chief election overseer: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio and Florida.

It wasn't just the U.S. Capitol that was vulnerable on Jan. 6, 2021. Armed protesters stood inside, and at the entrances of, several state legislatures, including the State Capitol in Lansing, Mich., shown here, after a rally supporting Trump. (Paul Sancya/The Associated Press)

Those governors' chairs could prove valuable in whether to veto or approve the election rules proposed by Republican-controlled legislatures. Across the country, several legislatures, including Georgia and Texas, have passed laws weakening non-partisan election offices; similar bills are sitting in numerous legislatures , including in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .

In Wisconsin, when Jacobs was asked if she expects her independent agency to retain its current powers, she replied: ""It depends entirely on who wins the gubernatorial election.""

3. Then there's Donald Trump. Will he fling the country back onto the roller-coaster of a Trump presidential run? We could find out this year.

Trump has said he intends to announce his plans for 2024 after the midterms. We could also learn this year whether legal trouble might hamper such a run.

We've recently learned that a grand jury in New York is investigating Trump's businesses and has reportedly subpoenaed him and his children; Georgia prosecutors are also investigating his efforts to overturn the last election.

Meanwhile, congresswoman Liz Cheney, a rare Trump nemesis in the Republican Party who sits on the congressional committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, has hinted that the panel could recommend a criminal probe into his post-election behaviour.

That congressional panel will ramp up its public activity this year. It's set to hold more hearings, then reportedly release preliminary and final reports by summer and fall.

Measuring the scope of the problem

One expert in political violence who advises the U.S. government and the Pentagon said the country has not even begun to grasp the challenge it faces.

Robert Pape compares political violence to a lightning strike upon dry kindling. Nobody can predict a lightning strike, but you can notice the dried wood lying around, creating the perfect condition for a raging fire. And the U.S. is covered in kindling, he says.

One researcher looking into the Jan. 6 movement assumed that most people who took part in the insurrection at the Capitol were fringe figures, struggling outcasts, economic losers or militia types. But he says the actual answer is more worrisome. (Leah Millis/Reuters)

After a career spent studying political violence abroad , he began, after last Jan. 6, focusing on his home country. And he's disturbed by what he's found.

""This [Jan. 6] movement is not fading away,"" said Pape, a political science professor at the University of Chicago and founder of the Chicago Project on Security & Threats.

Like many, he assumed he'd learn that most who took part in the insurrection at the Capitol were fringe figures, struggling outcasts, economic losers, militia types. But most weren't.

Pape found the opposite after months of data analysis on the more than 700 people charged in the Capitol attack and after conducting public opinion research.

More than half of those charged, he said, were business owners and CEOs or had white-collar occupations.

A tiny fringe were unemployed, and 13 per cent were known to be part of extremist and militia groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.

A cattle market lies in ruins after a car bomb exploded in 1997 outside a police station in Markethill, Northern Ireland. A researcher on political violence says he fears the U.S. is heading toward a long-term period of political violence and instability, like Northern Ireland’s religious clashes from the 1960s to the 1990s. (Reuters)

Most didn't live in strongly pro-Trump or rural areas. In fact, more than half lived in counties won by President Joe Biden; these counties were changing demographically.

Pape says counties where the white population is in decline are six times likelier to have had a resident arrested over Jan 6.

He then organized large surveys with his university's NORC organization and found that eight per cent of American adults believe Biden, a Democrat, stole the election and that it's legitimate to use force to reinstate Trump.

That's 21 million people — including millions who own guns and well over a million with military training.

Pape's overarching takeaway is pretty bleak: that the U.S. is in danger of a long-term period of political violence and instability, like Northern Ireland during the Troubles , driven by white fears of demographic replacement. And he says certain politicians are stoking those fears the way Serb nationalists did before the violent breakup of Yugoslavia.

""This is a mainstream problem,"" said Pape, who is also conducting research for the Pentagon on extremism in the ranks of veterans.

What happened that day

The congressional investigation into Jan. 6 has released snippets of what it's found. It held one public hearing where police officers described the hours-long battle to fend off the mob.

Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell told one hearing about injuries all over his body that sidelined him for months; he and colleagues were punched, pushed, kicked, shoved, pepper-sprayed and blinded with lasers.

They were also struck with hammers, steel bars, knives, bear spray, batons and their own police shields; police also seized firearms and found explosive devices outside the two parties' headquarters in Washington.

One Black officer, Harry Dunn, said he was repeatedly called racist epithets.

Hours later, while seated under the Capitol dome, he was consoled by colleagues as he sobbed and shouted: ""How the [expletive] can something like this happen? Is this America?""

The committee has text messages showing that Trump's family and friends spent hours pleading for him to intervene and call off the mob.

It was ultimately Mike Pence, vice-president at the time, who ordered in the National Guard.

What Trump's allies wanted that day was to prevent Pence from certifying the November 2020 presidential election result and to get him to either overturn the result or let Republicans do it in the House of Representatives.

Is there a solution?

Trump is still fuming at his former vice-president for refusing to act on the plan, and he has even defended members of the mob who chanted, ""Hang Mike Pence.""

Is there any solution — any tonic that might stabilize American democracy?

Democrats in Congress would love to pass an election reform bill that addresses some of the problems from 2020.

Their Freedom to Vote Act would simplify voting registration, make election day a holiday and make it a crime to intimidate election workers, punishable by a fine or jail time.

The plan on Jan. 6 was to stop then-vice president Mike Pence, right, from certifying the election, but it failed when Pence refused to go along. He was escorted from the legislature, then came back and completed the task. (Mike Theiler/Reuters)

Yet the bill is dead if Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema keep insisting on preserving the filibuster rule that requires a 60 per cent vote to pass most bills in the Senate.

Party leaders will try forcing a vote this month.

Even that long-shot effort falls short of the structural changes some political scientists are urging in order to detoxify politics.

Some want a new electoral system or new political parties to lessen dysfunction and increase the election chances of non-extreme candidates. But none of that is imminent.

So author and Harvard professor Levitsky proposes a more limited gambit for 2024: a national unity, pro-democracy presidential ticket. He wants Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to join forces in a campaign, perhaps featuring Liz Cheney and Sen. Cory Booker as running mates.

He surmises that progressive Democrats might hate this. And he blames the U.S. media and political class for still treating this moment as politics as usual — without grasping the gravity of the situation.

""It's very, very hard for people who grew up in the United States not to treat our elections as normal politics — as donkey against the elephant ; red against blue; Democrats against Republicans; who's got the better message and blah blah blah blah,"" he said.

""We're not in that world. We're in a world where one party is an authoritarian force and needs to be stopped.""

We may get a clearer prognosis this year.

The slow death of the republic that inspired America's

But the collapse of a political system can happen so gradually that there's not just one Jan. 6 moment to point to.

It's what happened to the republic America was modelled on.

In Rome, ancient norms were obliterated. In a power struggle in 88 BC, a general, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, invaded the city with his army, violating a sacrosanct precedent meant to insulate the republic from political violence.

The republic the United States was modelled on, Rome's, died slowly. Pictured here is Sulla, who marched on the city in 88 BC. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images)

""This was a discovery that could never be unmade,"" writes British author Tom Holland in his book Rubicon, chronicling the demise of Rome's republic.

""What had once been unthinkable now lurked at the back of every Roman's mind.""

Institutions kept breaking, the Senate's dysfunction deepened, mob violence grew. Finally, decades later, Sulla's enemy copied his feat, when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his army, installed himself as dictator and ended centuries of civic governance.

The Senate Rules Committee voted 11-5 along party lines to approve the measure involving school-book scrutiny (HB 1467), readying the issue to be considered by the full Senate.

An extension of Republicans’ recent push to increase parental rights and involvement in students’ education, the measure is largely centered on giving parents and members of the public broader access to the process of selecting — and eliminating — library books and instructional materials.

Bill sponsor Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, said the measure would “help the community understand” what materials students might encounter in the classroom.

“This is all about transparency and making sure that parents know exactly what's being taught in their schools,” said Gruters, who doubles as chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.

Under the bill, committees that meet for the purposes of “ranking, eliminating, or selecting” instructional materials would be required to include parents of school district students.

The proposal similarly would require school districts to publish to individual schools’ websites procedures related to media centers. Those procedures would have to provide for the “regular removal or discontinuance” of books based on factors such as alignment to state academic standards and relevance to curriculum.

If instructional materials are removed from a school using procedures that are spelled out in the bill, school districts across the state would be notified.

The state Department of Education would be responsible for publishing and regularly updating a list of materials that were removed or discontinued as a result of objections, and in turn the department would “disseminate the list to school districts for consideration in their selection procedures.”

Gruters said other districts would be made aware of prohibited materials “so we do have consistency, from one district to the next, of the books that were banned only.”

The measure drew strong objections from Democrats, who made comparisons between changes proposed in the bill and historical instances of censorship by authoritarian governments.

Sen. Gary Farmer, D-Lighthouse Point, criticized the measure as “really scary stuff” and likened its proposals to book burning in Nazi Germany during the 1930s.

“It’s common knowledge that book burning was an integral part of the propaganda campaign which led to the Nazi party taking control of Germany,” Farmer said.

The Senate committee approved a change to the bill to cap school board members’ terms at 12 years. The House passed the measure earlier this month with eight-year term limits for school board members.

Gruters, who is chairman of the Senate Education Committee, proposed the amendment. If the full Senate passes the bill with 12-year term limits, the measure would have to go back to the House.

“I think 12 years is a better number,” Gruters said. “Sometimes I feel that eight years just isn’t enough for members. And I think 12 years, you should certainly be able to get done everything you want to accomplish in that period of time.”

Danielle Thomas, director of advocacy and legislative services for the Florida School Boards Association, argued that school board elections already provide for regular turnover of members.

“We don’t believe that term limits are needed for our school board members. School boards see greater turnover in their elections than any other elected offices,” Thomas said, telling lawmakers that Florida school boards collectively have seen 36 to 46 percent turnover with each election cycle since 2010.

Later Tuesday, the Rules Committee also voted 11-5 along party lines to approve a measure (HB 7) that would target certain race-related instruction in schools and workplace training sessions. The bill emerged after Gov. Ron DeSantis sought to prevent the teaching of critical race theory, which is based on the premise that racism is embedded in American society and institutions.

Under the measure, which is ready to go to the full Senate, school instruction or a training exercise would constitute discrimination if it “compels” people to believe certain concepts.

For instance, part of the bill dealing with schools would label instruction discriminatory if it led students to believe that they bear “personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress” because of actions committed in the past by people of the same race or sex.

Democrats peppered Senate sponsor Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, with questions about the bill.

“What's the impetus for that line of thinking, that a teacher would create an imposition of guilt on a student because they are talking about history?” asked Sen. Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville.

“The impetus would be to have all of these constructive discussions and to make sure that our students are learning our history, including the mistakes and the terrible things that occurred in our past so that they’re not repeated again, without pushing on guilt to the individual student,” Diaz replied.

Critics also questioned the process that Senate Republican leaders used to move forward with the controversial education bills.

During debate over the bill dealing with books and school boards, Farmer suggested that Republicans were engaging in what he called a “Tallahassee two-step.” Both of the House bills had similar Senate versions that had not gone through all of their assigned committees.

“We have a rule in the Senate for House bills, if we’re going to take them up when we haven’t taken up a Senate bill or a Senate bill hasn’t made it through its committees, it’s supposed to require a two-thirds vote. So this is a little Tallahassee two-step here, where they bring the House bill over, refer it to one committee, vote it out of that committee, and then it gets to go to the floor so you don’t have to do that two-thirds vote,” Farmer said.",Q1

The victim, who has not been identified, was driving his Honda Civic north on the northbound freeway near Roxford Street when he was shot by the driver of a black sedan, the California Highway Patrol said.

The motorist suffered serious wounds to his face and jaw, authorities said. He crashed into another car before pulling over to the side of the freeway.

Los Angeles city firefighters transported the victim to Holy Cross Medical Center where he was listed as stable Thursday, the CHP said. His injuries were described as non-life-threatening.

After speaking with the victim, officers said they believe the shooting was prompted by a road rage incident.

“There could’ve been a prior altercation as far as a road range incident before the actual shooting — someone cutting someone off,” said CHP Officer Josh Greengard, who declined to comment on who initiated the altercation.

Motorists who witnessed the shooting immediately called authorities, Greengard said.

The gunman sped away in a black sedan, he said. Authorities have few leads on the identity or whereabouts of the suspect.

Authorities closed the freeway for an hour and a half to collect evidence, including bullet casings.

Some stretches of freeways and highways in Southern California have seen a spike in shootings throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but Greengard said the CHP’s Newhall patrol area, which includes much of the Santa Clarita Valley and parts of the San Fernando Valley, did not see the same trend.

https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/01/22/uofo-j22.html,Graduate students at University of Oregon walk out for safe working conditions,"University of Oregon (UO) graduate workers, students and community members held a rally outside of Johnson Hall on Tuesday in support of the graduate student union to demand measures to protect students and staff from COVID-19.

The Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation (GTFF) graduate student union has issued 18 “demands for a safer UO” which are divided into four categories: increasing remote instruction options, improving in-person protections against COVID-19, providing transparent public data about positive COVID-19 cases and allowing workers and students to participate in decision-making.

The GTFF demands include that UO move all courses to remote learning until Lane County cases decrease to CDC-defined low transmission levels, which is 50 cases per 100,000 people. The GTFF also wants the option for teachers and students to use remote learning if they feel unsafe resuming in-person instruction. Graduate teachers are also calling for the elimination of a requirement that instruction be simultaneously given in-person and via live broadcast such as Zoom.

Tali Bitton, GTFF’s vice president for organizing, said that teaching simultaneously in person and via broadcast is difficult for graduate teachers because they haven’t received training or resources for doing so. He said, “In the end, it’s not really fair to the students.”

This walkout comes as students and teachers globally are staging walkouts in protest of unsafe pandemic practices on their campuses. On the same day as the UO walkout, several students walked out of Grant High School in Portland, Oregon, telling KATU News that their campus is overcrowded and mask mandates are not being followed or enforced.

Calliope Ruskin, a student at GHS, said, “We need to be able to access our classrooms safely, and there is no way for me to be able to social distance from other people. My mom is immunocompromised, there is no way to protect myself at school.” GHS students echo GTFF’s demands when they are calling for mandatory N95 or KN95 masks for everyone and for more COVID-19 testing.

Students at Franklin High School in Seattle, Washington, walked out last Friday calling for similar increased safety measures such as remote learning, N95 masks for all, weekly testing, contact tracing, vaccines and boosters and daily updates to the district’s COVID-19 dashboard. FHS has the highest infection rate in its district according to the Seattle Public Schools COVID-19 Dashboard, which is surely undercounted due to overwhelmed testing sites throughout the city.

A student at Kamiak High School in Mukilteo, north of Seattle, spoke with the World Socialist Web Site. “At school, we’ve had children test positive in the library. It’s unfair quite honestly. When we look at the chart for COVID cases in our county, we’ve had up to 3 times more COVID cases compared to the initial outbreak when we went into lockdown. The numbers are growing, and our measly precautions are not preventing sickness. Human life should be above all.”

Students across the US, in cities like Chicago and Boston, have joined the movement for the closure of unsafe schools and other safety measures for protection against COVID-19. There is broad support for these actions as the Omicron variant rips through schools and workplaces nearly unhindered.

The Biden Administration’s “herd immunity” policy is a policy of mass infection and death that is provoking widespread militancy of teachers and students across the US. The Democratic Party has wholly embraced this policy of social murder, relying on token gestures and vaccines to cover for the consequences of their actions.

In December, Oregon Governor Kate Brown released a statement saying, “As Oregon prepares for what could be our worst surge in hospitalizations during this pandemic, I know that this is not the beginning of the new year any of us had hoped for. Time and again over the last two years, Oregonians have proven that we will stand with each other in our most difficult times. Your actions have saved lives, and it is because we have worked together to keep each other safe that Oregon still has some of the lowest infection and mortality rates in the nation. Please, do your part again—get vaccinated, get your booster shot, and wear a mask.”

This call for personal responsibility by Governor Brown belies that fact that her administration is forcing schools and workplaces to remain open and operate in person during this “worst surge in hospitalizations.” Despite claims of the “lowest infection rates in the country,” Oregon’s hospitals are so overwhelmed that Governor Brown made the decision to activate the Oregon National Guard to assist understaffed hospitals and long-term care facilities.

Schools are being forced to return to in-person learning under dangerous conditions precisely to allow students’ parents to be forced back to their workplaces to continue generating profits for corporations and Wall Street despite high risks to workers’ health and lives.

These walkouts are part of a broad struggle against the unsafe reopening of schools and businesses that is being carried out by students, parents and educators across the US in places like New York City, Chicago, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Portland, Baton Rouge and more.

The IYSSE and the WSWS ask all students, teachers and educators to join the growing movement for the protection of their lives against the dangerous Omicron variant of COVID-19 by resisting the unsafe opening of schools in the US and internationally.",Q1

PAUL — A day after a fatal shooting outside of a Richfield school, Minnesota policymakers agreed that they needed to work quickly to address gun violence in the state.

But they split about the best plan to do that.

ADVERTISEMENT

Gov. Tim Walz, along with top legislative leaders, on Wednesday, Feb. 2, had a candid conversation about what could prevent future shootings during a virtual conversation hosted by Forum News Service. And they said lawmakers should boost police funding to help get additional officers out on the ground as a first step.

“People are getting robbed, carjackings are a regular occurrence right now, innocent people are getting shot,"" Senate Majority Leader Jeremy Miller, R-Winona, said. ""What we need to do right now is get tough on crime and we do that by holding people accountable for their actions. If someone breaks the law, there should be consequences.""

Miller highlighted policies advanced by fellow Republicans that would increase state funding to help recruit and retain new officers and stiffen penalties for those involved in carjacking or violent offenses. He also said DFL proposals to restrict access to firearms would be a non-starter in the Senate.

Democrats have also proposed putting $100 million more into law enforcement recruitment, along with other programs aimed at keeping young people, as well as those with addiction or mental health disorders, from committing crimes.

Walz, House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, and Senate Minority Leader Melisa Lopez Franzen, DFL-Edina, said taking a tougher approach to combat violent crimes was appropriate. But they said that move had to come in tandem with extra programming for adolescents and supports in schools.

“We need to be tough on crime but we need to be tough on the causes of crime,"" Walz told journalists on the call. ""I think this legislative session can do that because you’re hearing a lot of goodwill to get there.""

Republicans on the panel, meanwhile, said policymakers should take things one step at a time. They agreed that prevention strategies and school programming could help keep young people from committing crimes. But those should come as a later step, they said.

ADVERTISEMENT

House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, passionately appealed to the other lawmakers to consider changes in Minnesota schools, particularly in the Twin Cities metro, to keep students on a path to graduation.

“We are failing these kids, our system is failing these kids,” House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said. “Until we get those kids the education they need and deserve and the tools they need to be successful, they’re going to keep holding guns to people’s heads on the street.""

Both legislative chambers held hearings or planned to take up public safety proposals during news conferences this week. Winkler urged the groups to use campaign rhetoric or other attacks to engage in the conversations.

""The gravity of these shootings, the gravity of the crime that we’re seeing, the gravity of antisocial behavior that we’re seeing across the board is real and it’s on us to bring our very best to stop it.""

Republicans leave door open to fire commissioners

Miller said his caucus would continue reviewing the performance of Walz administration commissioners during the legislative session.

Last fall, Walz asked him to drop the option to remove commissioners as a term for coming back for a special session, but Senate Republicans refused. In surprise moves in 2020, Senate Republicans voted to remove former Department of Labor and Industry Commissioner Nancy Leppink and Commerce Commissioner Steve Kelley.

In 2021, former Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Commissioner Laura Bishop stepped down before the Senate was set to terminate her.

ADVERTISEMENT

“The Senate takes our responsibility to evaluate the performance of commissioners very very seriously,"" Miller said. ""All commissioners will continue to be evaluated and they’ll do that through the committee process.""

Miller said that the commissioners who are nearly three years into their tenure would be assessed based on their performance, not policy positions.

Walz said the agency heads should've been assessed earlier and asked Miller and others to consider the difficulty the state faces in bringing on capable commissioners given the current worker shortage.

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-01-24/assange-granted-appeal-uk-supreme-court-extradition-us,Assange allowed to appeal to British Supreme Court over extradition to U.S.,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange raises his fist while being transported from a London courthouse in 2019.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday won the first stage of his effort to appeal a British court ruling that opened the door for his extradition to U.S. on espionage charges.

The High Court in London gave Assange permission to appeal the case to Britain’s Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court must agree to accept the case before it can move forward.

“Make no mistake, we won today in court,” Assange’s fiancee, Stella Moris, said outside the courthouse, noting that he remains in custody at Belmarsh Prison in London. “We will fight this until Julian is free.”

The British Supreme Court normally takes about eight sitting weeks after an application is submitted to decide whether to accept an appeal, the court says on its website.

The decision Monday is the latest step in Assange’s long battle to avoid trial on a series of charges related to WikiLeaks’ publication of classified documents more than a decade ago.

A year ago, a district court judge in London rejected a U.S. extradition request on the grounds that Assange was likely to kill himself if held under harsh U.S. prison conditions. U.S. authorities later provided assurances that the WikiLeaks founder wouldn’t face the severe treatment his lawyers said would put his physical and mental health at risk.

Last month, the High Court overturned the lower court’s decision, saying the U.S. promises were enough to guarantee that Assange would be treated humanely. Those assurances were the focus of Monday’s High Court ruling allowing Assange to appeal to the Supreme Court.

Assange’s lawyers say the U.S. offered its assurances only after the lower court had already rejected the extradition request. The High Court overturned the ruling anyway, saying that the lower court judge should have given the U.S. the opportunity to offer the assurances before she issued her decision.

On Monday, the High Court gave Assange permission to appeal to the Supreme Court so that it could decide “in what circumstances can an appellate court receive assurances from a requesting state ... in extradition proceedings.”

Assange’s lawyers have argued that the U.S. government’s pledge that Assange won’t be subjected to extreme conditions is meaningless because it’s conditional and could be changed at the discretion of American authorities.

The U.S. has asked Britain to extradite Assange so that he can stand trial on 17 charges of espionage and one charge of computer misuse linked to WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of leaked military and diplomatic documents.

Assange, 50, has been held at the high-security Belmarsh Prison in London since 2019, when he was arrested for skipping bail in a separate legal battle. Before that, he spent seven years holed up inside Ecuador’s embassy in London. Assange sought protection in the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault.

Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because too much time had elapsed.

American prosecutors say Assange unlawfully helped U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal classified diplomatic cables and military files that WikiLeaks later published, putting lives at risk.

Lawyers for Assange argue that their client shouldn’t have been charged because he was acting as a journalist and is protected by the 1st Amendment guaranteeing freedom of the press. They say the documents he published exposed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“He should not face criminal prosecution and decades in prison for publishing truthful information of great public importance,’’ said Barry Pollack, Assange’s attorney in the U.S.",Q1
https://www.wmnf.org/report-shows-floridians-support-single-use-plastics-regulation/,Report shows Floridians support single-use plastic regulation,"Plastics gathered from a local Florida beach. Credit: Oceana

According to a new report from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, 93% of Floridians and 97% of local governments believe that regulating single-use plastics is necessary.

Listen to the story:

Hunter Miller is Florida’s field representative for the environmental non-profit Oceana. Miller says Floridians want to see single-use plastics reigned in.

“We can’t rely on individuals to skip the straw bring their own water bottle,” Miller said. “That’s a part of the solution. But we need structural changes we need a change in policy that’s going to help us achieve protecting our oceans in a real systematic way.”

Florida has a ban on bans

In 2008, under then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, Florida became the first state to preempt local plastic bag bans, thwarting local ordinances. The law prevented local bans on polystyrene as well. Bans on those materials are in effect, banned. In 2019, Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill that would’ve preempted the “skip the straw,” campaign. Miller says Florida’s legislature should reverse those laws and empower local governments to lawfully reduce plastics use.

“We know, especially in Tampa Bay, that our bay, our estuaries, our beaches, healthy and abundant oceans, contribute to massively our economy but also our way of life,” Miller said. “The need to protect our oceans, and our beaches, and our way of life, is reflected in this stakeholder survey.”

Floridians support increased plastics regulation

According to Oceana, nearly 1,800 manatees and sea turtles swallowed or became tangled in plastic along America’s coastlines between 2009 and 2020. Florida had higher incidents of those animals dying or being injured from plastics than any other state. In 2020 alone, 7,000 tons of plastics entered Florida’s waters. Miller says the Florida DEP’s report shows people are noticing that wildlife is suffering because locals aren’t allowed to intervene.

“Constituents want to take action but we’re not allowed. And so there’s a huge hurdle those interests have a lot of power, and they don’t want the legislature to touch this. As this report points out, there is a huge demand for our government to protect the health bar of our communities in our beaches.

NEW from THE TRACE: The return of the machine gun. For decades, fully automatic weapons were expensive and rarely used in crimes. Auto sears, which can cost less than $20 online, have changed that. From 2017 to 2021, the number of federal prosecutions involving the conversion devices jumped from 10 to 83, according to our exclusive analysis of court filings. Our investigation with VICE News found over 260 cases filed in the last five years, including robberies, assaults, and murders, with over 1,000 auto sears recovered, data not previously compiled by the government. “They’re one of the scariest things we’ve dealt with since I became an agent,” one ATF veteran told Alain Stephens, The Trace’s West Coast Correspondent. You can read more of his investigation here.

Stay tuned to our site or Twitter for a companion video report on auto sears produced with Vice News.

Gun violence protest near the Capitol greets members of Congress with body bags. Activists with March for Our Lives placed 1,100 empty body bags on the National Mall, a symbol of the 170,000 lives lost to gun violence in the four years since its inaugural march. The gun reform group grew out of the 2018 march organized by survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed. The body bags spelled out “thoughts and prayers,” an effort to spotlight congressional (and President Joe Biden’s) inaction on gun reform. — Chip Brownlee, reporter



Washington enacts a package of gun reforms, including a ban on high-capacity magazines. Democratic Governor Jay Inslee signed a bill into law on Wednesday barring the manufacture, distribution, and sale — though not possession — of high-capacity magazines. At least one gun rights group, the California-based Firearms Policy Coalition, pledged to challenge the law in court. The full panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has jurisdiction in Washington, recently upheld California’s similar ban as constitutional. Inslee also signed a ghost gun measure that requires DIY firearm builders to serialize their wares and a bill prohibiting the open carry of weapons at city meetings.



South Dakota governor signs bill eliminating fees for concealed carry permits. Kristi Noem, a Republican, signed legislation this week eliminating any state or county fees for the permits, an annual loss estimated at $110,000. “It will not cost you a penny to exercise your Second Amendment rights in South Dakota,” Noem said in a statement. The state will reimburse counties for the revenue they will lose from being unable to collect permit fees.

MCGREGOR, Texas — Texas A&M Forest Service awarded the McGregor Volunteer Fire Department a free military truck through the Department of Defense Firefighter Property Program.

According to the fire department, the truck will help increase the department’s firefighting capacity and will be a dual-purpose vehicle.

The McGregor VFD also received a $20,000 grant through the Texas A&M Forest Service Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program to help with the transition.

According to the fire department, the money will be used to help with converting the trucks to the proper power needed to save lives in high-risk situations.

“The Firefighter Property Program issues excess military vehicles at no cost to the VFDs, said Texas A&M Forest Service Regional Fire Coordinator Matthew Schlaefer. “The departments convert the trucks to bolster their firefighting power, increasing their capacity to save life and property in their community and surrounding area.

McGregor VFD President Van Smith, says the truck will also be used for high water rescues.

“The primary mission of the truck will be for wildland firefighting with its 1,000-gallon water tank and bumpers sweeps but it can function as a rescue apparatus for high water rescues since we occasionally have to rescue people from flooded roads.”",Q1

Major companies in the defense market include Lockheed Martin Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, The Boeing Company, Raytheon Co. , Northrop Grumman Corp. , Bae Systems plc. , Airbus Group SE, Leonardo SpA, Thales group and General Dynamics.

New York, Feb. 28, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Defense Global Market Report 2022"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06240590/?utm_source=GNW





The global defense market is expected to grow from $452.69 billion in 2021 to $483.47 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8%. The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $604.82 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 5.8%.



The defense market consists of sales of air-based, sea-based and land-based military equipment by entities (organizations, sole traders and partnerships) that produce air-based, sea-based and land-based military equipment including support and auxiliary equipment such as radar, satellites, sonars, and other

auxiliary equipment or maintain, repair and overhaul defense equipment. The defense market is segmented into air-based defense equipment; sea-based defense equipment; land-based defense equipment; defense equipment maintenance, repair, overhaul services, and defense support and auxiliary equipment.



The main defense types are air-based defense equipment, sea-based defense equipment, land-based defense equipment, defense equipment maintenance, repair and overhaul services, defense support, and auxiliary equipment.Air-based defense equipment includes support and auxiliary equipment for the air-based defense such as radar, satellites, sonars, and other auxiliary equipment.



The various operation includes autonomous defense equipment, manual and involves various platforms such as airborne, land, naval.



Asia Pacific was the largest region in the defense market in 2021.Western Europe is expected to be the fastest growing region in the forecast period.



The regions covered in this report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.



The adoption of unmanned combat vehicles is one of the major trends in this market.An unmanned combat vehicle is a machine or motorized vehicle that runs without any physical human intervention.



These vehicles have a set of sensors for 360-degree situational awareness and for optical avoidance, steering actuators, brake, and laser scanner along with other autonomous features enabling remote or autonomous functioning of the vehicle.It is majorly used to inspect the surroundings and transfer the information to the operator through teleoperation or make autonomous decisions to deal with situations involving several technical challenges.



For instance, in January 2020, the U.S. Army awarded contracts for the development of Robotic Combat Vehicle- Medium (RCV-M). It is an unmanned robotic teleop combat vehicle with an onboard 20-to 50- millimeter automatic cannon. It can fight alongside infantry and destroy enemy armored personnel carriers, trucks, and troops.



Corner shot weapons are increasingly becoming popular due to the safety features they offer.A corner shot is a specialized weapon accessory, essentially a hinged chassis installed to a pistol such as a Glock, a handgun, or to a Beretta 92.



The hinge chassis allows the gun’s frame to bend around the corner and attack the target without exposing the soldiers.It is also equipped with a bore-sighted, high-resolution video camera, LCD monitor, and a built-in tactical light for navigation and illumination.



The corner shot rifles or guns are widely used in battle-fields, inside armored vehicles and tanks, on a turret up top, which will allow for a full 360-degree field cover while the triggerman remained safely inside the vehicle. The weapon is accurate and effective to 100 to 200 meters depending on the type of weapon.



Companies in the air-based defense equipment manufacturing market are increasingly investing in the development of autonomous fighter jets.Autonomous fighter jets are jets that do not require human pilots to fly and can fly for longer periods of time.



Autonomous jets are equipped with sensors to scan for potential threats and process more information at a given time.These jets are well equipped to collect intelligent data about the enemy, block the electronic systems of enemy aircraft, and shoot down other threats in the air.



Following the trend, Boeing Australia and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), in 2019, entered into a partnership to develop 3 prototypes of autonomous fighter jets named Airpower Teaming System or Loyal Wingman. These aircraft will fly alongside the piloted aircraft during battle to distract the enemies, assist in information gathering and surveillance.



The countries covered in the defense market report are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, UK, USA, Venezuela and Vietnam.

Kegan Kline, 27, is currently in jail on separate child pornography charges but he was free on February 14, 2017, when the girls were murdered.

He has recently been linked to their killings by police because he was behind a fake Instagram account that cops say the girls were communicating with.

Kline set up the anthony_shots Instagram page to solicit nude photos from underage girls which he said he would masturbate to. He used the photographs of Vince Kowlaski, a police officer and model who lives in Alaska.

In a jailhouse interview with HLN that will air on Saturday as part of its Delphi murder investigation special, Kline says police told him he was the last person to speak with the girls.

Kegan Kline, 27, is the real person behind anthony_shots, according to cops. He was arrested in 2017, ten days after the girls vanished, on separate child porn and child exploitation charges, but he has never before been linked to the Delphi murders. His attorney denied that he had any involvement

He bears an eerie resemblance to the man Liberty took a photo of on her phone before she was murdered, but he insists he had no role in their murders.

Kline was arrested on February 25, 2017 - ten days after Libby and Abigail's bodies were found - on charges that were not related to them.

He was living 37 miles from Delphi, in the town of Peru.

It's unclear what led to his arrest or if he was ever questioned by police investigating the Delphi murders.

Speaking from jail, Kline told HLN that he has 'no idea' why police are now linking him to the murders, but then said: 'I think it's because they said I was the last person to talk to her, is what they've told me.'

He maintained that he did not have anything to do with the killings.

'One hundred percent not,' he said when asked if he was the man Libby took a photo of on the bridge.

This is the suspect Libby filmed on her Snapchat account before she was murdered. She also recorded a man saying 'down the hill'

Police have never disclosed how the girls died and they say they don't intent to reveal the cause of death.

On Thursday, Doug Carter, Superintendent of the Indiana State Police, said told Good Morning America that they know who the killer is.

'My resolve to catch him is as strong now as it was day one.'

'But the difference now is that we know about you. A lot about you. Today could be the day. Sleep well,' he said.

The real man in the catfish pictures is Vincent Kowlaski, a married, 25-year-old Alaska police officer and father, who says he is horrified to have his face connected to the gruesome killings.

He told DailyMail.com last year: 'I was unaware that the Indiana state police were going to use my photos prior to them releasing all that information.

In December, police revealed the girls may have been communicating with someone online using these photos. It was a fake account and the pictures belong to a model and cop who lives in Alaska. The information about the fake Instagram account led to 'a tremendous number of leads' but police still have not made any arrests

'I had to learn about the whole case overnight and am appalled to know what happened to those poor girls.

'Instagram and cat fishing has been a problem for me since the start, these social media platforms do nothing to stop that type of thing from happening unfortunately.'

The girls' families say they are desperate for the case to finally be brought to a close.

'It's probably the smallest thing but it's the one thing we are missing and that's just what we keep hoping for - that one small thing will come to light and that this will be over soon,' Abby's mother Anna Williams said.

'They'd be finishing up their freshman year of college. Hard to believe. She would have turned into a really good young lady.'

'This guy could strike again. It could be your kids. It happened to our family, I don't want it to happen to anybody else.

Libby's grandfather Mike Patty added: 'This is not something anyone should go through.'

'Something inside of me just says she was going to film that, come home and say look at this guy, he was acting really weird.'

In December, there was a flurry of excitement over the case after cops tied the fake Instagram profile of Anthony Shots to their investigation.

They didn't mention that Kline was already in custody and had admitted to using the account to lure other minors into sending him nude photographs.

Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter claimed on Thursday that he knew 'a lot' about the suspect in the Delphi murders and warned: 'Today could be the day. Sleep well.'

It remains unclear now if police believe someone else might have been using the account.

The person in the photos on the account is Alaska police officer and model Vince Kowlaski.

He was stunned when police issued the photos in December without his knowledge, and said he had no idea that his images might be involved.

'I was unaware that the Indiana state police were going to use my photos prior to them releasing all that information.

'I had to learn about the whole case overnight and am appalled to know what happened to those poor girls.

'Instagram and catfishing has been a problem for me since the start, these social media platforms do nothing to stop that type of thing from happening unfortunately,' the 25-year-old told DailyMail.com in December.

Kline's public defender attorney denied that he was in any way involved in the Delphi murders when police connected him to the case in December.

Until then, the only suspect was James Chadwell.

But in May last year, Libby's sister said she did not believe he was the killer.

Chadwell had been jailed for the killing of another girl nearby but has never been arrested over the Delphi murders.

The Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department reinstated the indoor mask requirement on Jan. 14, and lifted it on Feb. 18 after infections and hospitalizations fell.

A bill (LB859) from Sen. Rob Clements heard by the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee on Wednesday took aim at the local health department's ability to take action in the future without approval from the state.

The measure highlighted the divide between those who felt the mandate was an overreach and those who say it helped save lives during the pandemic.

The Elmwood senator, who now represents a portion of Lancaster County after redistricting, said “there was no strong evidence or data that supports allowing Lincoln or Lancaster County to create their own (directed health measure) apart from the state.”

He also added the DHMs issued in Lincoln in 2020 and 2021 also created inconsistencies in the statewide approach to battling COVID, encroached on individuals’ personal liberty and led to an unequal playing field for businesses.

“It’s become clear to me that during a pandemic of an airborne virus that it would be best dealt with on a statewide level,” he told the Health and Human Services Committee.

Dr. Gary Anthone, Nebraska’s chief medical officer, testified in support of LB859, saying the ability of one county to create its own policies separate from the state led to confusion among people traveling between different public health jurisdictions.

“Viruses do not recognize county lines, which is why it is critical we use a statewide approach,” Anthone said, adding the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services would be able to provide more consistency from Omaha to the Panhandle.

Anthone, responding to a question from Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, said he was not aware of any data demonstrating a difference in health outcomes between jurisdictions where masks were required and where they weren’t.

But Abbie Fougeron of Nebraska Pulmonary Specialties, speaking on behalf of physicians, nurse practitioners and other front-line health care workers, contradicted Anthone’s claim, saying there was data to show Lancaster County fared better than other areas of the state.

Data from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control show there have been 132 COVID-related deaths per 100,000 people in Lancaster County; 187 deaths per 100,000 people in Douglas County; and 205 deaths per 100,000 people in greater Nebraska, Fougeron told the committee.

She also said the DHMs enacted by the local health department were made in consultation with medical professionals, and said requiring the county to get approval from the state would require it to navigate “a bureaucratic and politicized process.”

Supporters of Clements’ bill disputed there was any evidence to show masks work, and said the steps taken by the health department instead led to greater physical, mental and emotional health issues for some.

Mary Hilton of Lincoln said LB859 would “put (Lancaster County) under the protection of the Department of Health and Human Services.”

“We residents of Lincoln and Lancaster County need to be rescued and treated like the rest of the citizens of Nebraska,” she said.

Others took aim at what they called an overreach of government that came without any evidence that the masks worked.

Jack Riggins, a radio host, said the bill would correct a ""governance issue"" that would have never been highlighted without COVID and compared mask mandates to Nazi Germany and forced genital mutilation.

The difference between Lancaster County and the state's other public health jurisdictions is a wrinkle in state law few people were aware of before the coronavirus pandemic arrived in 2020 and the issue of mandating masks became politicized.

City officials have argued that Lincoln's health department, which has existed since 1889, predates the state law recognizing health departments, granting it more authority to act when public health is at risk.

And since 1997, a provision has existed in state law allowing cities to form joint health departments with counties of more than 200,000 people — a category tailored to the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department.

Throughout the pandemic, Gov. Pete Ricketts has opposed mask mandates and encouraged legal action against one imposed in Omaha during the omicron surge.

In other jurisdictions, city councils or other elected boards approved mandates.

Director Pat Lopez said the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department has issued directed health measures independent from the state for other issues that have arisen locally: a hepatitis outbreak at a local restaurant, an H1N1 vaccination clinic, and the Monkeypox, to name a few.

""You probably did not hear about most of these diseases because they were able to be taken care of with rapid action at the local level,"" Lopez said.

Compared with 700 other counties with similar demographics, Lancaster County -- which has recorded 424 deaths due to COVID -- was in the lowest 10% for death rates, she added.

County Commissioner Rick Vest said the ability to tailor a local response should be replicated elsewhere.

“LB859 mistakenly treats the (health department) as an exception that needs to be corrected rather than a model to be emulated,” Vest said. “This Legislature relied on guidance from the local health department to ensure the work of the people could be accomplished during the pandemic.”

Sen. Matt Williams of Gothenburg questioned the two decision-makers -- Anthone and Lopez -- about the decision-making process for issuing directed health measures on a statewide or a local basis.

To Anthone, Williams said there was a belief that the decision to issue a health measure at the state level was political in nature, and asked the chief medical officer how those decisions were made.

""It's definitely based on medical evidence -- not political -- but what we think is best for the community,"" Anthone said.

""The people who are making the decision are all medical in nature then?"" Williams asked.

""They are not,"" Anthone replied.

""So there are elected officials, I'll say who are political in nature, that are involved in making that decision?"" Williams asked again.

""Yes, there are,"" Anthone said.

Williams put a similar line of questioning to Lopez, asking if she took direction on decisions from Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird.

“The mayor does not provide any input or sway into what the decision is,” Lopez said.

“Has the mayor ever directed you to do anything?” Williams asked.

“Absolutely not,” Lopez responded.

The committee did not take any action on LB859 on Wednesday, the 35th day of the 60-day legislative session. Most committees will conclude hearings this week.",Q1

Frank Pallone and Mayor Daniel J. Reiman announced.

The terminal is part of the borough's efforts to run a ferry service to downtown Manhattan.

“This is great news for New Jersey residents and tourists who commute to downtown Manhattan,"" Pallone said in a statement Tuesday.

The ferry service also is seen as a boost for economic development in Carteret, Pallone said.

""I’ll continue to work hand-in-hand with Mayor Dan Reiman to fight for the funding needed to fully complete this project,” the congressman said.

In January, Port Imperial Ferry Corp., doing business as NY Waterway based in Weehawken, won a public bid to provide Carteret a 149-passenger ferryboat for $2.25 million.

Funding for the purchase came from a $1 million grant from NJ Transit and an additional $1.25 million grant from the Port Authority's Capital Fund.

Under the contract, Carteret’s ferry will have an ADA-accessible bathroom, two decks, bench-style seating, climate control, new ceilings, lights and paint.

The three-story Carteret Intermodal Transportation Center will have a waiting area, restrooms, food court/snack bar, operations center, meeting space and a public rooftop observation deck.

“The ferry terminal building is an important next step in our efforts to provide environmentally friendly transportation service for commuters within Carteret and throughout Central New Jersey,” Reiman said.

The funding will be distributed through the federal Ferry Grant Program, which supports existing passenger ferry service, establishes new ferry service and upgrades ferries, terminals and related facilities and equipment.

While this grant secures only partial funding for the ferry terminal, Reiman noted that ""the borough is hoping to obtain additional support for the project from federal funds allocated to the New Jersey Department of Transportation"" though the bipartisan infrastructure law.

""We look forward to expanding our ongoing partnership with the state of New Jersey in our efforts to advance the project,"" the mayor said.

from the oh-knock-it-off dept

Having seen both Florida and Texas have their “you can’t moderate!” social media laws tossed out as unconstitutional (wasting a ton of taxpayer money in the process) you might think that other state legislatures would maybe pump the brakes on trying the same thing. No such luck. There are efforts underway in a bunch of states to pass similarly unconstitutional laws, including Utah, Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio (not to mention states like New York pushing in the opposite extreme of requiring moderation). The latest to enter the fray is Georgia with its Common Carrier Non-Discrimination Act, with an astounding 24 ignorant co-sponsors who apparently hate the 1st Amendment.

The law is dead on arrival for a wide variety of reasons, but as you might have guessed from the name seeks to just randomly declare social media (and only social media) as “common carriers” and saying they can’t “discriminate” (and by “discriminate” they mean, “take down content from Nazis.”) The “declarations” on this bill are nonsense disconnected from reality.

Each person in this state has a fundamental interest in the free exchange of ideas and information, including, but not limited to, the freedom of others to share and receive ideas and information, regardless of their religious, political, or social beliefs or affiliations;

Yes, free speech means that you can say whatever you want, but it does not allow you to commandeer other’s property to do so. Because if it does, I’m demanding that the Georgia General Assembly read each day’s Techdirt posts into the official record every day. Otherwise, according to these silly, silly legislators, I’m being censored for my views.

As the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized, large social media platforms are the ‘modern public squares’

Neat attempt to elide the context of that statement, which was about the state banning people from social media, and not at all about the state forcing social media not to take down spam, trolls, and abuse.

In offering their services to all and providing a basic service to our economic, political, and social lives, social media platforms function as common carriers, are affected with a public interest, and are central public forums for public debate; Social media platforms with the largest number of users are common carriers by virtue of their market dominance;

Except they don’t. Common carrier is not just a magic phrase you get to say as you wave a magic wand. It requires that the service actually be a common carrier — which means providing commodity-like, interchangeable services to transport goods or data from place a to place b. That’s not what social media does.

Anyway, the key clause in the bill is the part that says that social media sites, now declared to be common carriers, are not allowed to take down any content based on their beliefs or political affiliation, among other things.

(a) A common carrier shall not censor or discriminate against a user, a user’s expression, or a user’s ability to receive the expression of another person based on: (1) The viewpoint of the user or another person;

(2) The viewpoint represented in the user’s expression or another person’s expression;

(3) A user’s geographic location in this state or any part of this state; or

(4) The actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, religion, religious beliefs, political beliefs, political affiliation, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, or disability of a user or another person or of a class of users or a class of other persons.

So, under this standard, you cannot ban anyone for being a Nazi (“political affiliation”) or for calling for jihad (“religious beliefs”). So that’s just great.

Perhaps someone should point out that under this law, no social media website could “ban critical race theory.” It would also make it impossible for Trump’s new social network, TRUTH Social, to live up to its promise to make its site “family friendly.”

Anyway, as if to demonstrate how this bill is exceedingly performative, and not serious at all, it looks like someone (probably a telco lobbyist) pointed out that under this bill, if it applied to broadband providers would create net neutrality. But for nonsense reasons, Republican politicians have decided that net neutrality is evil — even though broadband providers actually do fit the traditional classifications as a common carrier, so the bill explicitly says it does not apply to broadband ISPs:

‘Social media platform’ means an internet website or application that is open to the public, allows a user to create an account, and enables users to communicate with other users for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images. Such term does not include an: (A) Internet service provider or provider of broadband services;

So, the things that are not common carriers are declared common carriers, and the things that are common carriers are declared not common carriers.

People of Georgia: stop electing ignorant buffoons.

At least it doesn’t have a theme park exemption, I guess.

Sen Rubio calls for Lal's release and an end to the persecution in Pakistan, a country of particular concern for religious freedom violations #ExpressionNOToppression,"" Rubio tweeted. Currently, Notan Lal is in a prison in Sukkur in Sindh. He has a wife and four children. ""Notan Lal is detained for blasphemy-related offenses,"" the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said in a statement. On September 15, 2019, Lal, the owner and principal of a private school in Ghotki, was detained after a student accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during an Urdu lesson. Lal was charged with ""insulting the Prophet Muhammad"" (Sec. 295-C), according to the USCIRF statement. The accusation against Lal prompted protests and riots in Ghotki, where a Hindu temple was vandalized and Lal's school was damaged. On February 7, 2022, Lal was sentenced to life in prison and fined 50,000 rupees, the statement added. In a recent study on the blasphemy issue in Pakistan, a local Think Tank, Centre for Research and Security Studies had revealed that from 1947 to 2021, as many as 89 people were extra-judicially killed over blasphemy accusations in the country. It further stated that a total of 1,287 citizens were accused of committing blasphemy from 2011-21, the period in which Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) remained most active and expanded its support base across the country, reported European Times. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's government's failure to control incidents of blasphemy and an apparent soft- corner for the extremist Islamist groups, for political purposes, will have far-wider consequences for Pakistan in the coming months. In addition, the Taliban's victory in Afghanistan has emboldened the hard-line Islamist forces in Pakistan. All these factors are indicating that there will be more incidents of blasphemy killings.

http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-20220303-emw5fjbkdbg5zkxaohuw3qypti-story.html,"MTA chair wants power to ban repeat offenders from NYC subway, compares transit crime to drunk driving","MTA Chairman Janno Lieber wants the authority to ban repeat offenders from the subway, including the homeless man accused of smearing a stranger’s face with his feces last month on a Bronx train platform.

“I do not understand why the MTA cannot ban people, like that guy who had three priors of attacks in the subway system, from using our system,” Lieber said during an event hosted by NYU’s Rudin Center on Thursday. “That guy had 19 priors, had attacked subway riders and actually had a hate crime attack.”

Janno Lieber speaking at a press conference at the Brooklyn Army Terminal Annex on January 20, 2022.

Lieber was referring to Frank Abrowka, 37, the alleged poop attacker who was set free Wednesday, a day after being arrested and charged with a hate crime for spitting at and assaulting a Jewish man in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, last September.

Hours after he was released, Abrowka posted a video to Facebook showing he was at the Wakefield-241st St. station on the No. 2 line, the same station where he was caught on camera smearing his fresh excrement in an unsuspecting woman’s face.

He posted more videos on Thursday, including one with an unhinged rant in which he said, “The feces scenario should keep every female in the their right mind away from me.”

Lieber said people like Abrowka shouldn’t be allowed in the subways and compared the type of behavior to a DWI. “We take away drivers’ licenses for one drunk-driving episode,” Lieber said.

Frank Abrowka, 37, was arrested for the unprovoked Feb. 21 poop attack that was caught on camera.

State officials have at least one way to ban people from the subways via a law passed in 2020 by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

The law allows New York state judges to ban people from public transit for up to three years if they are convicted of unlawful sexual conduct while using the system. Under the law, judges can also issue bans for people convicted of assaulting MTA workers.

New York judges have issued just two subway bans since the law went into effect, according to courts spokesman Lucien Chalfen. One person convicted of menacing in Bronx Criminal Court was banned from transit for a year and a person convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in Brooklyn was banned for six months.

“Given the vast size of the subway system . . . a ban is unlikely to have more than a symbolic effect,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the advocacy group Riders Alliance. “The governor and MTA should be doing everything they can to make the subway as safe, welcoming and inclusive as possible by running more trains. Bans aren’t going to do the trick.”

Sarah Feinberg, who was interim NYC Transit president when Cuomo’s law was passed, said her team met with local judges and districts attorney last year to ask them to impose more bans on people who repeatedly commit crimes on the subway. She said the DAs told her to “pound sand.”

“When police see a repeat offender in the system they have to follow them and wait for them to commit a crime to arrest them — but that just means there’s another victim,” said Feinberg. “The police said this legislation would help them keep people out of the system, but there could be some exceptions, like if someone is going to work.”",Q1
https://scholarsandrogues.com/2012/04/25/errors-shortcomings-void-nasa-climate-letter/,Serious errors and shortcomings void climate letter by 49 former NASA employees,"On March 28, 2012, 49 former NASA astronauts, scientists, engineers, and administrators sent a letter to NASA administrator Charles Bolden Jr. The letter requested that NASA in general and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in particular stop publishing the scientific conclusions about the human-driven causes of global climate disruption. The letter was filled with no less than six serious errors regarding the science, data, and facts of climate science. The errors, in turn, exposed that the signers had confused their fame and/or their expertise in unrelated fields with expertise in climate science. And in response, NASA’s chief scientist politely suggested that the letter’s authors and signers should publish any contrary hypotheses and data in peer-reviewed scientific journals instead of trying to censor the publication of scientific conclusions from NASA climate scientists.

The first error

The first error in the letter is that the authors and signers deny that “empirical data” shows “man-made carbon dioxide” is having an impact on global climate disruption:

We believe the claims by NASA and GISS that man-made carbon dioxide is having a catastrophic impact on global climate change are not substantiated, especially when considering thousands of years of empirical data.

In reality, “thousands of years of empirical data” do substantiate the claim that man-made carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is driving global climate change. Michael Mann, Ray Bradley, and Malcolm Hughes demonstrated that modern warming of the Northern Hemisphere was very likely greater than at any period in the last 2000 years first in 1999, then again in 2008, and it’s been verified repeatedly by independent researchers Wahl and Ammann in 2007, Huang et al in 2000, Smith et al in 2006, and others.

Not only have multiple independent researchers demonstrated that global temperatures are likely greater than at any period in the last 2000 years, but the data used by researchers are all independent too. Sources as varied as marine sediments, corals, tree rings, stalagmites, boreholes, the length of glacial tongues, ice cores, and lake sediments all independently confirm that modern global temperatures are anomalously high. Independent researchers using independent data and methodologies to reproduce the each other’s results is the ideal for how to conduct good science.

Similarly, scientists have analyzed the effects of CO 2 on the balance of energy in the Earth’s climate system and found that CO 2 must be having a major effect. If it wasn’t a major driver of climate disruption, several well established physical laws would have to be wrong (conservation of energy, for one). For more information on this, S&R has some posts on this subject, both in reference to the Earth’s carbon cycle and Venus’ greenhouse effect. An even better high level overview is available from Skeptical Science.

The second error

The second error is that only a few climate scientists have declared that they deny the science underlying human-driven climate disruption, not the “hundreds” the letter claims. While the letter doesn’t provide any support for this allegation (yet another serious error), this is likely a reference to Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe’s December 2008 “Senate Minority Report” of about a supposed 700 scientists who deny human-driven climate disruption. The Center for Inquiry performed a detailed analysis of Inhofe’s list and discovered that:

Slightly fewer than 10 percent could be identified as climate scientists. [about 70]

Approximately 15 percent published in the recognizable refereed literature on subjects related to climate science. [about 135]

Approximately 80 percent clearly had no refereed publication record on climate science at all. [about 560]

Approximately 4 percent appeared to favor the current IPCC-2007 consensus and should not have been on the list. [about 28 – notes added by editor]

Inhofe’s prior lists have been found to be similarly defective. Furthermore, recent studies (Doran 2009, Anderegg 2010, S. Robert Lichter, for STATS in 2008, and a Pew survey of AAAS member scientists from 2009) found that scientists in general and climate scientists in particular overwhelmingly agree that human activity is disrupting the global climate.

The third error

The third error is the letter’s reference to “tens of thousands of other scientists” who supposedly deny climate disruption. Unlike the vagueness of the second error, this reference can only mean one list, namely the list of approximately 31,000 alleged scientists collected by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. While S&R debunked this list in detail three years ago, it’s worthwhile to reiterate a few key points from the original post:

The OISM’s criteria are so broad that nearly anyone with a Bachelor of Science degree is eligible to call him or herself a “scientist.” It doesn’t matter whether you work in a scientific field, whether you’re an engineer instead of a scientist, or even if you’re a stay-at-home Mom or Dad with an unused degree – if you’ve got a BS degree in one of a large number of fields, you’re a “scientist.”

Even if we assume that a mathematician, nuclear engineer, or veterinarian should qualify as a “scientist,” using the OISM’s own criteria produces over 10.7 million “scientists” who have graduated from US universities since 1970. The OISM’s 31,478 so-called scientists represents 0.3%, or one out of every 340 scientists. That’s an insignificant minority.

The OISM list contains only 152 atmospheric scientists, or 2.1% of the American Geophysical Union’s members who are atmospheric scientists.

The OISM list contains only 22 hydrologists, or 0.4% of the AGU’s hydrology group membership.

The OISM list contains only 341 meteorologists, about 2.4% of the American Meteorological Society’s membership.

The OISM’s list of names would be laughable if people didn’t refer to it in a naive or dishonest attempt to deny the remarkable agreement among climate scientists (and actual scientists in general) about the human-driven nature of climate disruption.

Coincidentally, the 49 former employees who signed the letter represent about 0.3% of the current headcount at NASA, never mind the between 54,000 and 102,000 people NASA has employed since it was created in 1958. As with the OISM list, 0.3% is an insignificant minority.

The fourth error (updated)

The fourth error is that the letter twice uses the subjective, unscientific term “catastrophic” in reference to climate disruption.

Scientists don’t use the term “catastrophic,” and there’s a good reason for that: try to define exactly what you mean by “catastrophic” in an objective way. Whether something is a catastrophe or not is a matter of opinion, and no scientist involved in climate would ever use such a subjective term to describe something that is objectively scientific. It’s probably fair to say that most scientists would view the end of all life on Earth as a catastrophe, but what about sea level rise that drives millions of people out of their low-lying homes? That would be a catastrophe for the resulting climate refugees, but is it “catastrophic” in a scientifically objective way?

The term “catastrophic” is used almost exclusively by people who oppose adaptation and/or mitigation of the projected outcomes of human-driven climate disruption, and it’s used in an attempt to make climate scientists appear biased or extreme. Actual climate scientists, on the other hand, simply describe what they project will occur in an objective manner, just as unbiased scientists should.

The fifth error

The fifth error is that the letter claims that there hasn’t been a “thorough study” of “natural climate drivers.”

[W]e feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate.

Natural factors in climate change – solar variability, Milankovic cycles, volcanism, El Nino, even cosmic rays – have been investigated very thoroughly, and none of the natural factors are capable of generating the observed disruptions in the global climate. The impacts of natural drivers on climate disruption have been investigated repeatedly and in detail, as the two figures (from the Skeptical Science website) below show.



Human vs. natural percent contributions to climate disruption over the past 50-65 years according to various peer-reviewed studies.

That’s 13 different ways we know that human activity is driving global climate disruption, and six major peer-reviewed scientific papers that describe just how much is driven by human activity vs. natural factors.

The letter’s authors and signers seem to want NASA to censor the publication of scientific conclusions about human-driven climate disruption until scientists are 100% certain the conclusions are correct. This is more than just unrealistic – it’s impossible. It’s impossible to guarantee anything in science or engineering to 100% certainty, and as former employees of NASA, every one of the authors and signers knows it instinctively: Apollo 1, Apollo 13, Challenger, and Columbia, just for starters.

Anyone who works for NASA – or, like I do, works for a NASA subcontractor – lives and breathes the fact that nothing can be guaranteed to 100%. Any former NASA employee who has forgotten this should be ashamed of themselves.

The sixth error

The sixth error is that the letter claims NASA is making “unproven” and “unsupported” remarks about climate disruption and asks NASA to not make any more. The analysis of the five prior errors shows just how wrong this really is – there’s a massive amount of proof and support that human activity, namely burning fossil fuels and agriculture, are the primary driver of climate disruption. But in case there’s any question of that, here’s a link to Skeptical Science’s list of climate myths, with detailed rebuttals supported by referenced peer-reviewed scientific papers in reputable journals: Taxonomy of Climate Myths.

And in case that’s not enough, we can recount a few of the established physical laws and properties of CO 2 that would all be wrong if human activity wasn’t the dominant driver of climate disruption today:

Conservation of energy

Conservation of mass

Quantum mechanics

Vibrational modes of CO 2

Radiative transfer

Isotope ratio science for carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14

Radioisotopic dating

et al

And that’s just a short list. The man-made nature of climate disruption is based on so many well established, basic physical principles that it can’t be rationally disputed without shattering large portions of modern science (physics, chemistry, biology, and geology just for starters) and ignoring most of the modern technology (GPS, IR cameras, heat-seeking missiles, weather satellites, etc.) that was successfully designed and built using that science.

As serious as all those errors are, each and every one of them can be corrected with education and experience. Of greater concern is the underlying causes of the errors, namely two related shortcomings on the part of all the letter’s authors and signers – the belief that their fame or their expertise in other fields automatically granted them authority to comment on climate science.

to the explosion) Mission Operations Control Room, April 13, 1970 (Apollo 13, just priorto the explosion)

Fame is no substitute for expertise

Many of the 49 former NASA employees are famous for one reason or another. I counted seven who were astronauts. Gerald D. Griffin and Joe Kerwin were both part of the team that got Apollo 13 home safe, and Griffin was also the Director of the Johnson Space Center. Christopher C. Kraft developed NASA’s Mission Control concept and also served as the Director of Johnson Space Center.

But while fame occasionally comes as a result of expertise, expertise is never a result of fame. If you’re not sure about this, ask yourself the following question: would you want Paris Hilton landing your commercial airliner? How confident would you be if NASA installed Snookie in Mission Control? Would you trust your retirement to George Clooney?

In reality, fame grants one thing – attention. When a celebrity speaks, people listen, even if people shouldn’t. In fact, the organizers of this letter (most likely Harrison Schmitt and/or Walter Cunningham) relied on their fame as astronauts to get Fox News, Marc Morano, the Huffington Post, Anthony Watts, the Houston Chronicle and others, to report on and repeat verbatim many of the letter’s naive or dishonest statements regarding climate.

Albert Einstein was the expert in relativity, and he earned his fame partly as a result of that expertise. But Einstein’s fame merely meant that people listened when he spoke, not that he was an expert on every subject on which he spoke. [See Ed. note below] In fact, he famously denied some of the weirder implications of quantum mechanics that have since been observed. Nikola Tesla claimed that relativity was something whose “exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists,” yet relativity has also been demonstrated. Lord Kelvin, developer of the concept of absolute temperature, denied scientific data and theories that demonstrated that the Earth’s age was older than 20-40 million years. Harold Jeffreys, one of the geologists who proved that the Earth’s outer core was molten, rejected plate tectonics entirely.

Those four scientists were justifiably famous, and all were brilliant scientists in their areas. But that doesn’t mean that they didn’t make mistakes, and it doesn’t mean that they always accepted the latest and best science. Each of them denied scientific theories that have since become mainstream scientific thought.

Similarly, many of the former NASA employees who signed the letter earned their fame, but they’re no more experts in climate science than Einstein was in quantum mechanics or Tesla was in relativity. The large number of errors in such a short letter (227 words in four paragraphs) demonstrates that the former NASA employees do not understand climate disruption and no amount of fame, however well earned, can change that fact.

Expertise is non-transferrable

But even more important than the issue of fame is the fact that expertise in one field does not make anyone an expert in a different field, even one that’s closely related. I’m an expert in designing electronics to convert light and temperatures into digital data that a computer can use, but that doesn’t make me an expert at designing the computer itself, the networking equipment used to move that data around, or the antennas used to transmit it from a satellite to the ground. The skills I have that are broadly applicable to all of electrical engineering give me a leg up in designing computers, networking equipment, and antennas, but only years of experience could make me an actual expert.

Given my electrical engineering expertise doesn’t make me an expert in every field of electrical engineering, I certainly can’t claim that my electrical engineering expertise makes me an expert in climate science. If I want to claim expertise in climate science, I first have to prove that I have somehow acquired the knowledge and skills of a climate expert.

None of the letter’s authors or signers have any expertise in a climate-related field, and they’ve offered no proof that they have independently acquired the necessary expertise. Expertise in the effects of high levels of carbon dioxide on astronauts doesn’t make one an expert on CO 2 ‘s effect on ecosystems. Expertise in lunar geology doesn’t make one an expert in geochemical sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Expertise in heat transfer through space shuttle heat tiles doesn’t make one an expert in heat transfer between the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere. Even expertise in weather forecasting doesn’t make the forecaster an expert on climate.

No amount of expertise on one subject can magically bestow expertise on any other subject. Expertise must be earned through dedicated effort day in and day out, over the course of years. And there’s no evidence that any of the letter’s authors and signers have earned any climate expertise.

Think about this for a moment. If you were in charge of the safety of the space shuttle upon re-entry, who would you listen to first – an electrical engineer like me, or an expert in the shuttle’s ceramic heat tiles? Unless I could prove that I knew what I was talking about, you’d correctly ignore my advice and listen to the actual expert.

So why would you listen to an expert on heat tiles – or medicine, or lunar geology – when he’s writing a letter about climate science? Especially a letter that is packed full of obvious, naive or dishonest errors.

NASA’s response to the letter

NASA’s chief scientist, Waleed Abdalati, published a short response to the letter. In it, Abdalati wrote that “NASA does not draw conclusions and issue ‘claims’ about research findings” that NASA researchers conduct. Instead, NASA “strongly encourage[s] scientists to communicate” the results of their research “after these studies have met the appropriate standards of scientific peer review.” Abdalati also said

If the authors of this letter disagree with specific scientific conclusions made public by NASA scientists, we encourage them to join the debate in the scientific literature or public forums rather than restrict any discourse.

In other words, put up or shut up. Clearly NASA doesn’t have the same concerns about the scientific conclusions of their scientists that these former NASA employees do.

So why did the 49 former NASA employees sign this letter filled with naive or dishonest claims against NASA and the researchers at GISS? Without asking each and every signer, it’s impossible to say beyond guesswork. Perhaps the signers were misled by the authors. Perhaps they’re concerned about budget cuts gutting manned space flight more than it already has been (all the signers are from Johnson Space Center in Houston, where Mission Control is located). Perhaps they’re merely ignorant of how much elementary science would need to be wrong in order for human-driven climate disruption to be incorrect.

Or perhaps it’s as simple as they said in the letter: “At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees….” Abdalati’s excellent response makes it clear that NASA’s exemplary reputation is intact, as is the reputation of NASA’s current employees.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the reputations of these 49 former NASA astronauts, scientists, engineers, and administrators.

[Ed. Note (4/26/12): A quantum mechanics researcher pointed out to me in an email that my point about Einstein isn’t quite accurate – Einstein was one of the many co-developers of quantum mechanics, so he was an expert in the subject, even if did reject quantum entanglement.]

https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/education/2022/01/14/covid-students-schools-walkouts-protest-omicron/6517812001/,Students don't want to learn in a 'COVID petri dish.' They're walking out to prove their point.,"As teachers unions and schools battle over in-person and remote learning, students nationwide are demanding a seat at the table. Many have staged walkouts this week.

“We are the ones who have been in this environment every day. It's our bodies that we're putting at risk,"" said Kayla Quinlan, a 16-year-old student activist at Boston Day and Evening Academy. “Students should have a say in what their learning environment looks like, but our voices are always left out.""

School officials have also faced pressure to stay open for the sake of students' academic, social and mental well-being. Research has shown extended school closures during the pandemic have exacerbated mental health challenges and worsened learning outcomes.

While specific demands vary, students' requests largely center around allowing remote learning options as an alternative for those who are worried about coming to school, rather than shutting classrooms down altogether. Student coalitions that have advocated for shifting fully to remote have only called to do so temporarily if schools do not enforce stricter COVID-19 precautions, including more frequent testing and higher-quality masks.

Despite surging COVID-19 cases across the country, fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant, Quinlan said many Boston schools have started to take precautions less seriously, often not enforcing masking or social distancing.

SCHOOLS AND COVID:The pandemic changed American education overnight. Some changes are here to stay.

“It feels like a breeding ground for COVID, like a COVID petri dish,” she said. “How are you supposed to feel safe?”

This is why students in Boston and elsewhere in Massachusetts staged a walkout Friday, Quinlan said. Similar student walkouts and protests have happened in New York City, Milwaukee, Seattle and Oakland, California.

And after returning to class just two days ago, students in Chicago also staged a walkout Friday morning, led by a new organization called Chicago Public Schools Radical Youth Alliance. The alliance has demanded that the school district and government officials “bring students to the bargaining table” in negotiations with teachers, who refused to come to in-person school for a week. Students also want public apologies for comments officials made about the Chicago Teachers Union during the intense standoff last week.

“We stand with the educators, mentors, adult supports, and parents of our school communities, but most importantly, we stand for ourselves, our peers, & our needs,” the alliance said on Twitter last week. “We believe that WE should be the ones to execute, steer, and decide what is best for ourselves, our lives, our health, and our safety.”

Around lunchtime Tuesday, hundreds of New York City students walked out of class to call for remote learning options during a wave of cases as the omicron variant rapidly spreads through the city.

Samantha Farrow, a 16-year-old student organizer at Stuyvesant High School, called it an “uplifting moment” and said she felt less alone in her fears about COVID-19 cases in schools.

Before winter break, she cried to her mother, anxious about going to school with surging cases, especially while living with an immunocompromised family member, she said. When she returned to school this year, she said, it was “pretty desolate,” with half-empty classrooms and missing teachers. Because of staffing shortages, most days have been “non-instructional days” spent reading on her own or scrolling through her phone.

She said a remote-learning option will not only help students feel safer but also offer better-quality instruction in classrooms already disrupted by spikes in cases.

“Students are the ones having to go to school every day in these conditions,” she said. “We have ideas about what can help make this better.”

KIDS ARE GETTING COVID:How the omicron surge is impacting child hospitalizations, school safety

Several student activists told USA TODAY walkouts nationwide have offered hope and a sense of solidarity after they've felt sidelined by local and district officials in conversations about COVID-19 in schools.

""It's encouraging to see that we're not the only ones fighting, that there are people in other states who are fighting for the same cause and we have each other's backs,"" Farrow said.

In Oakland, students organized a sick-in Thursday and created a petition signed by more than 1,200 students. Ayleen Serrano, a 15-year-old sophomore at MetWest High School, said organizers have gotten emails of support from students in cities across California, including San Jose and Los Angeles, as well as from Florida, Texas and Canada.

""It's so exciting to see this spread so far,"" Serrano said. ""I hope what we're doing is inspiring others to use their voices.""

The string of walkouts this week are part of a renewed period of growth for high school activism, said Joseph Kahne, a professor of education policy at University of California, Riverside.

He said much of this spike in student protests came about in response to the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in 2020 and concerns about climate change. He hasn't seen such an upswing in student activism since the 1960s and 1970s.

RAPID TESTS, LOTS OF RAPID TESTS:How US schools plan to stay open amid omicron-fueled COVID-19 surge

""We're living in a tumultuous time, and the stakes are high. Students recognize that these issues will affect them,"" he said. Protests over COVID-19 policies ""add something valuable to our political discourse by letting us hear from the young people these policies affect most.""

When her fellow student activists left their classrooms in Boston on Friday, Quinlan didn't join them in the walkout she helped organize. On Wednesday, she found out she tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

“I'm really sad that I won't be able to be there showing solidarity with my fellow peers,” she said. “There's this sort of painful irony. But this is exactly the reason why we're doing this. We deserve more. We deserve safety. And we are going to fight for change.”

As workers continue to leave their jobs en masse, the phenomenon known as the “Great Resignation” seems to be far from over. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, quits totalled 4.5 million in November, a record high, and have been trending upward since April 2020. The quit rate—defined as the number of monthly quits as a percentage of total employment—rose to 3.0% in November, tying September’s record.

Historically, job openings, hires, and separations have tracked each other. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted this pattern. At the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, total separations rose to a record 16.3 million as businesses across the country laid off workers and shut down. Separations were also high in April 2020 but then returned to more typical levels and have been trending upwards ever since. At the same time, job openings have been climbing rapidly, reaching near record levels in October 2021 amidst widespread labor shortages.

As businesses across the country struggle to hire, workers continue to quit in droves. Both total quits and quit rates have been rising since the spring of 2020, causing quits to account for an increasingly large share of total separations. The pandemic has caused many workers to reassess their priorities and look for jobs that offer more flexibility as well as better pay and benefits. Fortunately for them, the current labor market puts workers in a good position to make headway on these goals. Job openings currently total 10.6 million, and with 6.9 million unemployed workers, there are about 1.5 jobs per every unemployed worker.

While quits tend to be higher in lower-paying sectors, quits have been rising across nearly every industry. The accommodation and food service industry, which includes restaurants, bars, and hotels, had the highest average monthly quit rate for 2021 at 5.7%. Additionally, the industry had the greatest increase in its quit rate from 2020 to 2021, at 1.5 percentage points. Government had the lowest quit rate in 2021, and is the only sector that saw a decline in its quit rate year over year.

Quit rates vary across the country due to factors such as local job market conditions, cost of living, and local industry makeup. To determine the states with the highest quit rates, researchers at ChamberOfCommerce.org analyzed the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The researchers ranked states according to the average monthly quit rate in 2021. Researchers also calculated the total quits in 2021, the percentage point change in the quit rate from 2020 to 2021, and quits as a percentage of total separations in 2021.

Here are the states with the highest quit rates.

Detailed Findings & Methodology

To determine the states with the highest quit rates, researchers at ChamberOfCommerce.org analyzed the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. The researchers ranked states according to the average monthly quit rate from January to October 2021, the latest data available. In the event of a tie, the state with the higher total number of quits from January to October 2021 was ranked higher. Researchers also calculated the percentage point change in the average monthly quit rate from 2020 to 2021 (comparing January to October 2020 to the same months in 2021) and quits as a percentage of total separations in 2021.",Q1
https://www.fox5dc.com/news/maryland-judge-orders-state-to-redraw-congressional-district-map,Maryland judge orders state to redraw Congressional district map,"A Maryland judge ruled Friday that the state’s new congressional map is unconstitutional, the first Democratic-drawn map to be struck down by a court this redistricting cycle in what the judge called a ""product of extreme partisan gerrymandering.""

So far courts have intervened to block maps they found to be GOP gerrymanders in North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, infuriating Republicans and leading conservatives to push for the U.S. Supreme Court to limit the power of state courts to overturn maps drawn by state legislatures.

Judge Lynne Battaglia gave state lawmakers until Wednesday to come up with a new congressional map plan.

Download the FOX 5 DC News App for Local Breaking News and Weather

Battaglia, a retired judge from state’s highest court who was assigned the case in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, issued the ruling after a trial last week in which Republican lawmakers contended that Maryland’s congressional map approved by the General Assembly in December violates the constitution by drawing districts that favor Democrats, who control the legislature.

She found that testimony in the case supported the argument that ""the voice of Republican voters was diluted and their right to vote and be heard with the efficacy of a Democratic voter was diminished.""

""The limitation of the undue extension of power by any branch of government must be exercised to ensure that the will of the people is heard, no matter under which political placard those governing reside. The 2021 Congressional Plan is unconstitutional, and subverts that will of those governed,"" Battaglia wrote.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Trial over Maryland's new legislative maps begins

Battaglia has a long history in Maryland’s legal community. She served as a member of the state’s highest court from 2001 to 2016. She served as Maryland’s U.S. attorney from 1993 to 2001. She also was chief of staff to former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat, from 1991 to 1993.

An appeal by the state is almost certain. Raquel Coombs, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said the office is reviewing the decision.

Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and House Speaker Adrienne Jones, who are both Democrats and members of the panel that first approved the map, said they believed the new districts upheld the letter of the law by enacting fair boundaries that reflect demographic shifts in the state.

""We respect the diligence put into the trial judge’s determination and we will review the court’s order that establishes brand new legal standards for the drawing of the Maryland Congressional map,"" Ferguson and Jones said in a joint statement.

In Maryland, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 and Democrats hold a strong majority in both chambers of the legislature, the GOP has long criticized the map as one of the most gerrymandered in the nation.

""Judge Battaglia’s ruling confirms what we have all known for years — Maryland is ground zero for gerrymandering, our districts and political reality reek of it, and there is abundant proof that it is occurring,"" said Doug Mayer, a spokesman for Fair Maps Maryland.

The ruling comes under the unusual circumstances of Maryland having a Republican governor in a redistricting year. Gov. Larry Hogan, who has long sought reforms to the way the state draws political boundaries, created a separate commission to draw maps for the state’s congressional seats and state legislative districts in hopes of taking politicians out of the process of drawing districts.

Hogan submitted the maps to the General Assembly, but the legislature moved forward with maps approved by a separate panel that included top legislative leadership, including four Democrats and two Republicans.

Chief Judge Joseph Getty last week delayed the state’s primary from June 28 to July 19, as courts weigh challenges to the state’s new legislative map as well as the congressional map.

At trial last week, a witness for Maryland Republicans testified that partisan considerations took over when Democrats drew the map. Democrats currently hold a 7-1 advantage over the GOP in the state’s eight U.S. House seats. The new map made the district held by lone Republican Rep. Andy Harris more competitive for a Democrat to potentially win.

The trial involved two lawsuits. One was brought by a group of Republican state lawmakers backed by Fair Maps Maryland. The other was brought by the national conservative activist group Judicial Watch.",Q1
https://news.yahoo.com/iowa-legislative-session-begins-setting-235241998.html,"New Iowa legislative session begins, setting the stage for debates on tax cuts, culture wars","Iowa Republicans began the 2022 legislative session Monday promising to “hold the line” against the Biden administration while pursuing their own priorities to cut taxes and attract workers to Iowa.

The Capitol corridors buzzed Monday as lawmakers, lobbyists and members of the public returned to the Statehouse for the first day of the 2022 legislative session. It was a day primarily filled with procedural formalities and introductory speeches as legislators begin their work for another year.

With an election approaching this fall, Republicans are confident their conservative agenda at the state level will present an attractive choice for voters, compared to Democratic policies at the federal level. GOP officials have criticized Biden's pandemic mitigation policies as overreaching — especially vaccine mandates for workers — and say Iowans prefer their approach of letting individuals manage the risks of the pandemic themselves.

""We need to ensure that we’re here to hold the line and protect the freedoms of Iowans,"" said House Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford. ""We’ve already seen the lengths that this president’s administration is willing to go to infringe on the rights of individual Iowans, parents and businesses. We cannot let that happen here in Iowa. We must push back.""

Overall, Republicans said the work they've done over the last five years while in full control of Iowa's government has placed the state in a strong position.

""I’m always excited to start a legislative session, but I’m more excited than I’ve ever been,"" Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, R-Ankeny, said at the Republican Party of Iowa’s legislative breakfast and fundraiser. ""And I’m always optimistic to start a legislative session, but I’m more optimistic than I’ve ever been.""

Meanwhile, Democrats in their opening day speeches said Republicans have pursued a divisive agenda that has contributed to the state’s workforce shortage. And Senate Minority Leader Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, praised President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne for passing federal legislation like the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure law.

“But President Biden’s leadership may not be enough to overcome the Reynolds workforce crisis and the Republican policies that are hollowing out rural Iowa,” Wahls said.

Republicans promise ‘permanent tax cuts’ for Iowans

Republican leaders projected a united front on their top priority for the coming year: income tax cuts.

“The state is taking in more tax money than it needs, and Iowans deserve to have that money back,” Grassley said. “We must return that money to the Iowa taxpayer.”

Across the Capitol rotunda, Whitver sounded a similar note.

“We must come to the Capitol this year and keep our promises as Republicans,” he said. “When we over-collect your tax dollars like we have, we’re going to give them back in permanent tax cuts.”

Speaker of the Iowa House Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, kicks off the first day of the 2022 legislative session, Monday, Jan. 10, 2022, at the Capitol in Des Moines.

Whitver said Republicans’ strength comes from keeping their campaign promises and putting aside their differences to work with each other to accomplish their agenda.

“We not only have a Republican trifecta, but we have one of the strongest governing Republican trifectas in the entire country,” he said.

More: The Iowa Legislature is returning for its 2022 session. Here are 5 issues to watch.

Some Republicans have been clear they hope to completely eliminate the state’s individual income tax. But on Monday they seemed to acknowledge that may not happen this year.

“Our goal should be focused on the total elimination of income tax,” Senate President Jake Chapman, R-Adel, said at the GOP breakfast. “While that may not be possible in the very first year, we must have that as our goal.”

Iowa has a billion-dollar budget surplus. Democrats say tax cuts using that surplus should be targeted to the middle class.

“When we look at rightfully returning tax surplus dollars to Iowans, will they see that middle-class families finally benefit from tax cuts?” asked House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights.

Wahls called for “comprehensive tax reform” that “closes loopholes and attracts new investment instead of alienating new employers.”

Democrats say they’re open to compromise on workforce bills, but warn of ‘culture war’ legislation

Democratic leaders took a critical tone in describing Republicans' policies over the last several years but also said they hope to find areas of compromise. Leaders said they agree that workforce is a large issue but laid the blame on Republicans

Wahls said Republican legislation over the past few years has contributed to the crisis and called for a halt to ""pouring gasoline on the divisive culture war.” He said he believes the majority is poised to continue passing polarizing legislation.

“Republicans are now promising us more of the same — that hasn’t worked,” he said. “We’ve been told it will be more of the GOP greatest hits this session: more attacks on LGBTQ Iowans, more gasoline on the culture war fire and more attacks on the First Amendment.”

Senate clerks, pages and legislative staff are sworn in on the first day of the 2022 legislative session, Monday, Jan. 10, 2022, at the Iowa Capitol in Des Moines.

The latest First Amendment attack, he said, was the GOP-led Senate’s decision to no longer allow journalists to work at press benches in the Senate chamber, where media members have sat for more than a century. Republicans have said the decision is due to difficulty defining “media.”

Republican leaders also previewed more topics that could spark contentious debates.

Chapman began his opening day speech by condemning what he said was an “attack on our children” in public schools. In Iowa and across the country, some parents and conservative politicians for different reasons have attempted to ban a variety of books from school curriculum or libraries. Chapman has previously called for legislation that would make it a felony to distribute what he refers to as “obscene” books.

“We have some teachers who are disguising sexually obscene material as desired subject matter and profess it as artistic and literary value,” he said. “The literature being pushed on our students should disturb all of us.”

Chapman called Monday for legislation that helps parents afford to send their children to other schools and said he wanted to hold accountable “those who distribute this repulsive and criminal content to minors.”

Konfrst said polarizing education legislation could turn families away from Iowa.

“Will we send them the message that only certain types of families are welcome here?” she asked. “Will we send the message that we prioritize more public money for private schools, statewide solutions to local problems, and a divisive agenda that’s rife with unintended consequences that make Iowa less welcoming?”

Wahls said Republicans have taken the wrong approach to education in general.

“Iowa’s education crisis isn’t happening because of critical race theory or books Republicans are trying to ban,” he said. “It‘s happening because of the extreme, anti-public education policies enacted by Gov. Reynolds and this Republican Legislature that are driving teachers out of Iowa.”

Session begins amid another COVID-19 variant surge

The 2022 legislative session begins as the coronavirus again begins surging in Iowa after the holidays. The Iowa Department of Public Health reported Jan. 3 that positive tests had increased 37% week over week, although hospitalizations had dipped. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Jan. 4 that the highly transmissible omicron variant is now the dominant strain in Iowa’s region.

Precautions at the Legislature are less stringent than the previous year, when entrants to the Capitol underwent temperature checks upon entering the building and Senate subcommittee meetings required participants to appear over Zoom. Those meetings will now allow in-person attendees, Senate Republican spokesperson Caleb Hunter said in an email. But he said lawmakers are continuing to give Iowans the ability to stream subcommittee and committee meetings from across the state.

COVID-19 policy appears likely to remain an issue of debate this year.

A group of protesters gathered under the rotunda Monday morning to protest vaccine mandates. The rally was similar, though smaller, to other rallies that groups held last year during the beginning of the session and the two special sessions in the fall.

Rep. Jon Jacobsen, R-Council Bluffs, spoke to the crowd and outlined legislation he is proposing that would widely ban businesses from asking about or maintaining records of a person's medical treatment status, including vaccinations.

""Our state motto is 'Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.' Our motto is not 'our lobby ties we prize and our rights we will bargain,'"" he said, drawing applause. One member of the crowd beat a snare drum in agreement.

A page for the Iowa House of Representatives sets out a flyer on each representative's desk before the start of the new session on Monday, Jan. 10, 2022, at the Iowa Capitol in Des Moines.

Republican leadership has largely indicated they want to wait on Supreme Court decisions about vaccine mandates before taking legislative action, but they have said the Legislature should remain ready to act on the issue.

Konfrst used part of her opening day remarks to call on legislators to avoid spreading misinformation, including about COVID-19, and to make decisions based “in reality, not internet conspiracy theories.”

“Our kids deserve to know the full truth about our history without interference or threats from lawmakers,” she said. “Our families deserve the truth about how to stay healthy during the pandemic, instead of falsehoods promoted by some politicians. Our democracy needs us to uphold the truth so it can endure.”

What’s next at the Capitol this week?

The legislative session is scheduled to continue Tuesday with a full day of committee meetings and culminate with Gov. Kim Reynolds’ annual Condition of the State address, where she will lay out her priorities for the upcoming year. The 6 p.m. address will be delivered to a joint session of the Legislature in the House chamber and will be aired live on Iowa PBS and livestreamed at DesMoinesRegister.com.

During the Republican Party's breakfast Monday morning, Reynolds said she was glad to have people back in the Capitol.

“I have to admit that the Capitol is pretty quiet when you’re not there,” she said. “So we are excited for you to come back, to infuse that beautiful Capitol building with energy and to really get things done.”

“Now, maybe two weeks into it, we’ll probably be ready to send you home,” she joked. “But we’re so happy to have you back.”

Iowa’s Chief Justice Susan Christensen will give the Condition of the Judiciary address at 10 a.m. Wednesday, followed by the Condition of the Iowa National Guard address at 10 a.m. Thursday.

Payton Gendron, 19, pleaded guilty to 25 counts, including first-degree murder and terrorism motivated by hate.

Ahead of the sentencing on Wednesday, a family member rushed towards the killer and was restrained by security.

Other relatives shared emotional impact statements.

Barbara Massey, whose sister Katherine was killed, said to the gunman: ""You are going to come to our city and decide you don't like black people. Man, you don't know a damn thing about black people. We're human.""

Ms Massey's statement was interrupted by her own son lunging toward the gunman. She told reporters outside court ""he saw me emotional and I'm his mom"".

""We're close,"" she said. ""You hurt one of us, you hurt us all.""

Zaire Goodman, who was injured, suffers from survivor's guilt, his mother told the courtroom.

""He is dealing with the pain that I as a mother cannot bear,"" Zeneta Everhart said.

""On that day this terrorist made the choice that the value of a black human meant nothing to him… whatever the sentence is that [the gunman] receives, it will never be enough.""

Brian Talley lost family member Geraldine Talley in the shooting.

He said: ""I forgive you, but I forgive you not for your sake, but for mine and for this black community.""

All of the 10 people killed were black. Three others were wounded.

Wayne Jones, the son of a victim, Celestine Chaney, addressed the killer: ""You've been brainwashed. You don't even know black people that much to hate them. You learned this on the internet.

""I hope you find it in your heart to apologise to these people, man. You did wrong for no reason.""

The killer wept as Tamika Harper shared memories of her murdered aunt, Geraldine Talley.

Ms Harper told him: ""Do I hate you? No. Do I want you to die? No. I want you to stay alive. I want you to think about this every day of your life.""

Investigators said the gunman researched the racial makeup of Buffalo, which was 200 miles (320km) away from his house in Conklin, New York, before his attack.

Wearing bullet-resistant armour, he live-streamed the 14 May attack at Tops Friendly Market after writing online how he had been inspired by other racially motivated shootings.

But speaking to the court on Wednesday he warned against copycat shootings.

The gunman, who is not eligible for parole, said: ""I shot and killed people because they were black. Looking back now, I can't believe I actually did it.

""I believed what I read online and acted out of hate. I know I can't take it back, but I wish I could, and I don't want anyone to be inspired by me and what I did.""

As she delivered her decision, Judge Susan Eagan said: ""There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances.""

New York state no longer allows the death penalty, but prosecutors at the federal level may seek it over hate and domestic terror charges to which the gunman has pleaded not guilty.",Q1

Following the August 2020 evidentiary hearing, Morphew was released on bond in a September decision by former 11th Judicial District Judge Patrick Murphy. At that time, Murphy also bound the case over for trial.

Information disclosed from the evidentiary hearing is not new, but former Denver Chief Deputy DA Craig Silverman said public disclosure is important for the transparency of the courts.

""It is great that the public can now see the basis for the court rulings on probable cause and whether Barry Morphew needed to remain behind bars until his trial,"" Silverman said. ""It’s only right that the public can formulate opinions about the performance of the judicial system.""

Now available to the public for the first time are screenshots of text messages which tell a story of a woman who was preparing to leave her husband. In some of them, Suzanne Morphew confided to a friend who lived out of state about her failing marriage and about how hard their spiraling relationship had been on the couple's two daughters.

One text message included in the court release is a message which prosecutors said was key to her disappearance. She wrote it the morning of May 6, 2020, three days before her last known communication.

At 10:17 a.m. that Wednesday, Suzanne Morphew texted her husband: ""I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just have to figure this out civilly.""

That message was retrieved by investigators from Barry Morphew's mobile phone. Suzanne Morphew's cell phone was never recovered.

The prosecution has also been ordered to release video and audio evidence in the case, which may include at least 20 interviews with Barry Morphew in the year before he was arrested. Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on Mother's Day of 2020. Her body has never been found.

During courtroom testimony, the identity of Suzanne Morphew's texting confidante, Sheila Oliver, was revealed. On the first day of the hearing, former Chaffee County prosecutor Jeff Lindsey questioned FBI Agent Ken Harris about the nature of the emotional communication. Harris interpreted the texts through interviews he had with Oliver.

In the months before she disappeared, Suzanne Morphew wrote in a text to Oliver, ""He’s not stable. It’s guilt and desperate measures he’s taking.""

Lindsey asked Harris what was meant by the word ""unstable"" and Harris answered, ""Sometimes something would set Barry Morphew off and he’d be angry and other times he'd be fine. Suzanne didn’t know when he’d be mad.""

In another text exchange with Oliver, Morphew appeared to be ready to leave the marriage.

""I feel like I’m crazy. I just had a conversation with him. Pretty much told him I can’t be healthy and stay in this.""

Photos released in the document dump also help tell the story of Suzanne Morphew's disappearance, including one of her bicycle after it was recovered from the side of a slope on May 10, the day she was reported missing. There's also a photo of her turquoise bicycle helmet by itself on a mountainside. It was found a week after the bike was discovered just under a mile away.

Other prosecution photo evidence includes injuries to Barry Morphew's hands and scratch marks on his upper left arm. Barry Morphew told investigators he got the marks after looking for his wife in the dense trees near their Chaffee County home.

Defense exhibits include Berla vehicle forensic reports which show where Barry Morphew's 2013 Ford 350 model truck was parked on the day prosecutors say he killed his wife. That data reveals his truck did not leave the driveway of the couple's Maysville home from the time Barry Morphew got home from work that day until the next morning when he took off for a landscaping job in Broomfield.

There is also a screenshot taken from Suzanne Morphew's iCloud account showing she was learning to say romantic messages in Spanish after defense attorney Iris Eytan said she and her lover discussed running off to Ecuador.

""Of course I’ll marry you. I love you so much,"" was keyed into an app called Language Corps, and ""I love you so much. I can’t live without you.""

During the next hearing in the Morphew case set for Tuesday, a motion filed by the defense for a change of venue will be on the table for discussion. That motion has not been made public, but Silverman said Friday's document release should not be a major concern for a possible jury pool.

""There is so much out there on the internet already. If the judge asked jurors to set aside pictures they saw in January, I'd bet most jurors could do that.""

MINOT, N.D. — For nearly fifteen years, family members and friends of Anita Knutson have lived with an aching grief, intensified by a lack of answers regarding what happened to the then-18-year-old in her final hours and minutes.

ADVERTISEMENT

On June 7, 2007, Minot State University student Anita Knutson was found stabbed to death in her off-campus apartment. Her body was discovered by her father and two apartment maintenance workers.

She was found face down on her bed. The murder weapon, a pocket knife, was discovered by law enforcement in her room, according to Minot Police Chief John Klug.

From that moment, the search for Anita Knutson’s killer began — DNA swabs were collected from all known close contacts and interviews with persons of interest were conducted. Yet with every turn, the case hit barriers.

Alibis dismissed Anita Knutson’s roommate and a prominent sketch of a man seen running near the scene of the crime turned out to belong to a runner on a regular route.

Investigators continue to monitor advances in DNA technology — including the expansion of DNA databases — in the hopes of revealed answers. Yet by all accounts, the case has gone cold, leaving Anita Knutson’s family and friends in a perpetual state of disbelief and uncertainty.

In 2013, friends and family members of Anita Knutson raised funds to display a billboard in Minot, N.D. Knutson was murdered in her off-campus apartment in June 2007.

Discovering Anita Knutson

Anita Knutson came from a close-knit family from the Butte, N.D. area. Her parents, Gordon and Sharon Knutson, adopted Anita Knutson as a baby — later, they also adopted her younger siblings, Daniel and Anna Knutson.

The family was known for their kindness and closeness, family friend Erin Haustveit said. Even as Anita Knutson had moved out of the house to attend Minot State University, a roughly 1-hour drive away, Sharon Knutson remained in touch with her daughter daily.

It was for that reason that Sharon Knutson began to grow worried after not hearing from her over the early June weekend in 2007. Concerned, Gordon Knutson made the drive on a Monday to Anita Knutson’s off-campus apartment, where he first noticed her vehicle parked outside.

Unable to get in through the front door — and unable to get an answer to his knocks — he requested the assistance of the maintenance worker and janitor, who initially pointed out that the window screen to Anita Knutson’s bedroom was slashed.

As they looked closer, they saw her face down on her bed. A robe covered her bloodied body.

Law enforcement deemed the time of death to have occurred at some point in the early hours of Sunday morning — a claim Klug said was reached based on the information known at the time.

“There hasn’t been anything to indicate that it would have been earlier. I think the conclusion that was drawn was the day before she was found was the last time we knew that anybody had heard from her, so that’s why we believe that it would have probably been some time the day before or the morning of,” Klug said.

Reports indicate no evidence of sexaul assault. Klug was not able to confirm whether there were defensive wounds on Anita Knutson.

For those who loved her, the next few days were a blur of disbelief and heartache.

“It was devastating, I mean there’s just no good way to say it,” Haustveit said. “I still remember when I found out. I was at work, and I had gone to my work locker and pulled out my cell phone, and I had so many missed phone calls from a number of different people.”

The news of Anita Knutson’s death spread fast, particularly throughout her college and hometown communities. Near her hometown, friends and family members gathered to mourn and wrap their heads around a tragedy that only days before had seemed impossible.

“For me personally, and again we were 19 at the time — or however old — it was really overwhelming because it was scary,” Haustveit said. “It was scary. Things like that don’t happen in Minot, North Dakota. Things like that don’t happen to people we know.”

Expecting answers

One thing Anita Knutson’s family and friends could cling to during those first turbulent days, weeks and months was a hope that answers would soon be delivered.

Investigators were busy collecting DNA from those who were close to Anita Knutson, and interviews were being conducted. Those who mourned waited for answers they believed would come.

Anita Knutson was found murdered in her off-campus Minot apartment building in the summer of 2007. A suspect has yet to be named.

“I think now, we kind of lived on that hope for so long that this would get solved… that we would figure out who did this, we’d figure out why they did it, and then we could kind of move on,” Haustveit said.

But that wasn’t the case. It still isn’t.

An ongoing investigation

Where the case sits today, Klug said there are no named suspects.

“So far, we don’t have any strong suspects. I think it’s just that there may be some people that fit a little stronger on the list for us, but there’s not a strong suspect at this point,” he said.

There were theories investigators looked into during the early days. Anita Knutson did have a roommate she did not get along with. At times, their verbal altercations had led to accidental physical contact, yet no arrests were ever made.

While the roommate did have an alibi, provided by her parents who claimed she was with them throughout the weekend, she was still subject to polygraph tests and multiple interviews throughout the years.

“There has been nothing that I would consider completely clearing her as a suspect,” Klug said. “At this point we just don’t have enough evidence to clearly say that it’s not a particular person.”

Following her death, a tip also led to a sketch drawing of a man seen running away from the apartment around the suspected time of the killing. The man quickly came forward in cooperation with investigators. A regular runner, he was cleared once it was proven he was out for a jog on his routine route.

The severed window screen and the robe

Law enforcement continued to look into other factors of the case, including the screen on the window that had been cut. Klug said that, to the best of his knowledge, there were no obvious signs of blood left on the screen. He did, however, confirm the window was not considered by law enforcement to be the point of entry for the person who killed Anita Knutson.

“It doesn't necessarily match up based on how that apartment is laid out and where the window is and how far you would have to climb to get in that window,” he said. “There were a number of things that were a little unusual about the screen.”

Klug said it’s difficult to know if the severed screen was a move by the killer to make it look like he or she had entered the apartment through the window, but he claims it is possible.

“There are some theories. I guess we haven’t done anything, as far as an in-depth trial, to see if it could be done, but with where the cut was, where the window was, it appears that maybe the cut was done as a stage and not necessarily as an entry point,” he said. “But again, it’s one theory that we have.”

While the case has slowed to a near halt in recent years, advancements in DNA collection and databases do provide some hope that a potential match within the system could provide long sought after answers. Investigators also still remain in possession of the murder weapon, the small pocket knife.

In terms of the robe used to cover Anita Knutson’s body, Klug said that aspect of the crime scene doesn’t point them in one direction or another when considering whether the assailant was someone Anita knew.

“I think if we developed a strong suspect, maybe it would mean something, but at this point there’s nothing unusual about it, I guess,” Klug said.

On the near horizon, Klug also said there will be a renewed effort to bring in new investigators from around the region — and country — to gain a fresh perspective on the case and hone in on any details that deserve attention.

Dealing with the loss of Anita Knutson

For those who knew and loved Anita Knutson, she was a shining star — a devoted daughter, sister and friend who is deeply missed to this day.

“It was hard for everybody — her family, her brother, my classmates, there are still so many people who are heartbroken over it,” Haustveit said. “Even to this day, I still get emotional talking about it.”

Anita Knutson had just finished her freshman year at Minot State University when she was found stabbed to death in her off-campus apartment. No arrests have been made in connection with her murder. Photo courtesy of In Loving Memory of Anita Knutson Group.



For Anita Knutson’s younger brother, Daniel Knutson, the loss was particularly devastating. Due to the close nature of their relationship, many who knew Daniel Knutson claimed her death changed him.

“Unless you knew him, it’s really hard to describe it. He was outgoing, he was funny, he was homecoming king, people loved being around him,” Haustveit said. “And all of that magnetism just died when she died.”

Daniel Knutson died from suicide a year and a half after his sister’s murder. His family and friends link his death to the loss of Anita Knutson.

From Haustveit’s perspective, watching the Knutson family, known for their closeness and kindness, walk through immense grief has been hard for many to wrap their heads around.

“I think what’s so devastating about this too is that this family was just loving and wonderful and beautiful and kind. They lost a daughter, and then shortly thereafter they lost a son, and they’re still fighting to try to figure it out to this day,” she said.

As for who killed Anita Knutson, so many are still at a loss to answer that question. For Haustveit, it’s difficult to imagine that someone who knew her would be capable of taking her life.

“Part of me in a weird way hopes it was a stranger, and not somebody that actually knew her because I can’t imagine if you knew her, you would ever do something like this,” she said.",Q1

“I remember them with their faces cut, and I see and talk to them every day,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who as chairwoman of the Rules Committee was a central figure in the counting of electoral ballots. “It is the faces of the officers that trigger that day for me. It is a constant reminder of what they did and what they are still up against.”

https://www.pressherald.com/2022/01/27/ruralist-lament-the-week-that-was/,Ruralist Lament: The week that was,"It’s winter here on the farm. Nothing to do but feed the stove, review seed catalogs, try to get over my Omicron infection and pan for news nuggets in the frigid, murky (main)stream of media. The week began in holiday-mode with the rote recognition of Martin Luther King Day. Dr. King, being safely dead was not on-hand to dispute the now conveniently cartoonish characterization of his life and struggle. He had “a dream” we are told — you know — for Black Americans. For “inclusion.” Apparently he was an early-adopter of identity politics. So, that’s cool. Right?

By the time he was assassinated, he (and the movement) were calling for an end to the barbarous war against the people of Vietnam, a universal guaranteed annual income, with public housing and health care as an economic right for everybody. Feel free to check. In 1967, a year before he was struck down in Memphis supporting the striking “sanitation workers” and organizing for the Poor People’s Campaign, he gave a speech at New York’s Riverside Church: “Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence.”

He announced, “I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin to shift from a ‘thing-oriented’ society to a ‘people-oriented’ society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.” He named the United States as “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.”

That hasn’t changed, yet we don’t talk about it in polite company. King was “a little edgy” for his times — and ours. On Holliday Monday the Guardian published a Michael Harriot column offering some useful history. He wrote, “…. For the entirety of the 39 years that King lived and breathed, there wasn’t a single day when the majority of white Americans approved of him. In 1966, Gallup measured his approval rating at 32% positive and 63% negative. That same year, a December Harris poll found that 50% of whites felt that King was ‘hurting the Negro cause of civil rights,’ while only 36% felt he was helping. By the time he died (sic) in 1968 three out of four white Americans disapproved of him. In the wake of his assassination, 31% of the country felt that he ‘brought it on himself.’ ”

Speaking against the latest war-of-opportunity, and for universal economic rights to income, housing and health care doesn’t always get you killed. But even today it makes the privileged “uncomfortable” and will likely even get you “a reputation” as a trouble maker. Ouch.

Since the vampiric Reagan/ Thatcher dystopian duo officially dismissed the idea of public housing (or public anything) in the Anglo-American political realm, we’ve relied on voluntarism, charity and public subsidy to private profit as “solutions” to social problems. Government money is sluiced to private corporate types and these profit-takers theoretically provide vital stuff like housing “opportunities.” A few days before the MLK distraction, a fire in a Bronx apartment tower killed 17 residents; injuring and displacing many more. The New York Post reported (1/13/22) that previous inspections by the New York Housing Authority had cataloged what the Post called “horrific conditions” in housing described as “decrepit.”

It was reported up here only because one of the “investor” owners was the Maine-based “Low Income Housing Corporation,” now dba LIHC Investment Group. The corporate website reports, “Our mission is simple and straightforward: forge creative relationships that capitalize the financial needs of our clients. … Over the years of working with investors and limited partners — drawing upon our extensive experience and creativity in tax consequences, regulatory issues and partnership structures — LIHC Investment Group has been able to maximize sales proceeds for our clients. …”

Not too “people-oriented.”

Yes dear reader, decades post-assassination this now reflects the way “we” deal with low income housing, if “we” deal with it at all.

Preliminary to the EliteMeet at Davos, the week also featured a report from Oxfam: “Inequality Kills.” It found that during the Covid conflagration a new billionaire “has been created every 26 hours (in an increasingly) violent economy … (where) billionaire wealth blooms, in which millions of people are killed, and billions of people are impoverished due to inequality; in which we burn the planet and our future human existence on the altar of the excesses of the rich.”

The report called for sharply higher taxes on folks like Jeff Bezos, noting his earlier “Marie Antoinette ‘let them eat cake moment’” when the world’s richest man … “launched himself into space in his luxury rocket while millions were dying needlessly below him” without vaccines or food.

Yeah, not too “people-oriented” alright.

The crash occurred at Laura Koppe and Lockwood and killed an innocent woman and injured two young children, ages two and five, according to the Harris County Sheriff’s Office (HCSO). Officials say the five-year-old remains in critical condition while the two-year-old is stable, according to KTRK.

Chilling surveillance footage that captured part of the crash shows the deputy’s vehicle covered in flames barreling through a store parking lot and colliding into parked cars, KTRK reports. A homeless man named Johnny Walker was at the scene and recounted the crash to the outlet.

Watch Below:

“I’m homeless. I was doing some work for someone. I was taking some tools back when I heard ‘boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,'” Walker said. “I ran out here to see what it is and I saw a lot of cars, but I paid attention to the fire. My instincts were to go to that car and help him out, because he was crushed in on both sides.”

“I thought it was going to blow up,” Walker told the outlet. At that point, he sprung into action.

“Nobody was trying to make an effort, so when I went on one side, couldn’t get in. I jumped over the car, two more youngsters came and jumped behind me,” Walker said. “We pulled him. I opened the door and got him out. We picked him up, put him over the car, took him inside the store.”

Once inside the store, the deputy “came to,” Walker said.

“He came to when we were checking his pulse. I kept talking to him, ‘Stay with us. Help is on the way,'” Walker explained.

He asked how he kept a level head in the traumatic situation.

“Because I would want someone to do it for me,” an emotional Walker said. “I’m just disappointed we couldn’t help someone else.”

The deputy was transported to Memorial Hermann Hospital, and three other adults were conveyed for evaluation and treatment.

“It is said our deputy is in stable condition and we’re praying he makes a full recovery,” Gonzalez said.

The deputy had been responding to a report of an aggravated robbery at a CVS store in the 10800 block of Eastex Freeway and Tidwell said HCSO Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, per KTRK. The HCSO received a report of the robbery at 10:42 p.m. Officials say once on scene, the deputy saw a man leaving the pharmacy that matched the suspect’s description and the deputy tried to stop him, but the man did not comply.

Gonzalez explained the deputy reported to be chasing a suspect before his radio went silent at 10:52 p.m. Authorities say the suspect led the deputy at speeds of 90-miles-per-hour, according to KHOU.

While chasing the suspect, the deputy got into a collision with a black car on Laura Koppe and Lockwood before crashing into five other vehicles, police say, according to KTRK.

The occupants of the car were the innocent woman who died and the two young children.

“I tried to help that lady. She passed though,” Walker said tearfully.

“I’m just thinking about them little kids,” he told KTRK.

“I just wish I could have done a little more,” he said. “When you have kids and family, even if you don’t, it’s just a critical point in time. It’s not about color, it’s about helping one another.”

Sheriff Gonzalez sent his condolences to the innocent victims.

“I want to extend our condolences to the family of the deceased female, and we’re also praying for the two children injured in this crash,” he said according to KHOU.

The suspect fled the scene, according to the HCSO.",Q1
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-grill-biden-judicial-nominee-ties-progressive-district-attorneys,GOP senators grill Biden judicial nominee over ties to progressive DAs,"The Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for several of President Biden's judicial picks Wednesday, and a number of Republicans expressed particular concern over the background and philosophies of one nominee's ties to progressive prosecutors.

Nina Morrison, a senior litigation counsel with the Innocence Project who once served as its executive director, has served as an adviser for the transition committees of Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon, and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, all of whom support progressive criminal justice reforms.

As Morrison answered questions regarding her nomination for the Eastern District of New York, GOP senators expressed concern over some of these policies, specifically regarding decisions not to prosecute certain types of offenses.

PHILADELPHIA TOP COP VOWS ‘JUSTICE’ FOLLOWING BROAD DAYLIGHT ATTACK THAT LEFT 12-YEAR-OLD WOUNDED

""We have prosecutors who are saying, ‘To hell with the legislature and the people, we’re not going to prosecute an entire line of cases.' And I think my question is pretty straightforward: Do you agree with that or disagree with it?"" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. asked.

Morrison responded by saying she has never been a prosecutor, then said she could not ""give a categorical yes or no"" answer. Kennedy later asked if Morrison believes a judge should be able to decline to hear cases for certain types of offenses.

""My position would be that judges cannot refuse to adjudicate or hear a case and ignore the will of the legislature,"" Morrison said, before recognizing that district attorneys, as executives, have a ""greater discretion.""

Kennedy asked if it would be appropriate if a district attorney said she was no longer going to prosecute armed robberies.

""It would depend on the circumstances,"" Morrison replied.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, followed Kennedy and indicated immediately that he had a problem with Morrison's nomination.

MUGSHOTS RELEASED OF SUSPECTS IN CASE OF MISSING NEW YORK GIRL FOUND UNDER STAIRS

""Ms. Morrison, you've urged this committee to look at the whole of your record. I will confess, the whole of your record is deeply disturbing,"" Cruz said.

The Texas Republican pointed to ""skyrocketing crime rates"" across the country, specifically addressing rising homicide, carjacking and burglary rates.

""And all of those are a direct result of the policies you've spent your entire lifetime advocating,"" Cruz said.

Cruz noted that, in Philadelphia, from the time Krasner was elected, the city's murder count rose from 315 to 562 in 2021. Similarly, Cruz noted that in Los Angeles County, there were 397 murders in 2021, up from 258 in 2019 before Gascon's election.

10 TIMES LEGAL GUN OWNERS RECENTLY THWARTED CRIMES IN LIFE-THREATENING SITUATIONS

""Why is it that you keep being part of the transition team helping advise district attorneys on how to release violent criminals?"" Cruz asked.

Morrison responded that she only advised the transition teams on ""conviction integrity"" and reviewing old cases, not ""front-end prosecution policies.""

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., also accused Morrison of supporting policies that are soft on crime, pointing to her praise of St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner in an article.

SAN FRANCISCO DA ALLEGES POLICE USED WOMAN'S RAPE KIT DNA TO ARREST HER FOR SUSPECTED CRIME

Morrison noted that her praise was based on Gardner's role in finding evidence that exonerated one of Morrison's clients.

Hawley, who is from Gardner's state of Missouri, recalled that during ""rioting that convulsed the city of St. Louis,"" which included the alleged assault of police officers, police arrested 36 people, only for Gardner's office to release all of them, claiming that police did not provide sufficient evidence.

""Is that the kind of approach that you stand by and think is appropriate for prosecutors to take?"" Hawley asked.

Morrison repeated that the article she wrote — and the praise for Gardner that it included — was limited to a specific situation.

Hawley responded by noting that Morrison's praise of Gardner was more general than that, referencing how Morrison said Gardiner is ""part of a cohort of prosecutors who seek a new approach to justice and, in particular, seek to reform current tough-on-crime practices.""

https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/politics/douglas-county-clerk-third-in-colorado-to-face-election-security-breach-investigation,Douglas County clerk third in Colorado to face election security breach investigation,"DENVER – A third Colorado clerk faces investigation by Colorado’s secretary of state’s office over possible breaches of the county’s election security protocols and alleged copying of election system hard drives.

Douglas County Clerk and Recorder Merlin Klotz was ordered Thursday by Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold to answer questions regarding a post made on Telegram last year, which is attributed to him, about making a “full image backup of our server before a trusted build was done this year.”

The secretary of state’s office said the potential breach happened before the Aug. 16-17 trusted build of Douglas County’s voting system and that it does not believe any copies of the system hard drives that were made have created a security risk for Colorado’s elections.

That is similar to what the office said about Elbert County Clerk and Recorder Dallas Schroeder’s alleged copying of the Elbert County voting system hard drives.

“While anomalies were not discovered at the time of the 2021 trusted build, this new information requires an investigation of whether there were violations of rules and statute during Clerk Klotz’s ‘full. Image backup’ of the election server,” states an order sent to Klotz on Thursday by Griswold’s office.

Klotz is a Republican who is among a host of GOP officials, also including Schroeder, who sued Griswold, a Democrat, in November, claiming the election software used by Colorado counties in the 2020 election was not properly certified. Griswold’s office has said the suit was “based on multiple unfounded election conspiracy theories.”

Thursday’s order says the Department of State sent Klotz an email asking questions about the Telegram post and the claims made within it on Jan. 28 but that he did not respond.

The new order requires Klotz to provide information on the dates he or others created images of the election system hard drives and how, along with more question on who has had access to the images and the chain of custody. Douglas County is one of the only counties in the state that uses a ClearVote voting system and not a Dominion system.

The Telegram post, allegedly made by Klotz, “stated that he submitted comments to the [Mike] Lindell legal team about log files and voting equipment passwords,” according to Griswold’s order, which asks whether Lindell or any members of his so-called legal team been in contact with him about the hard drive images.

Klotz is also ordered to tell the secretary of state anyone else he communicated with about copying hard drive images.

Along with he and Schroeder, Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters stands accused of helping a non-election worker copy Mesa County’s voting system hard drive as well. She currently is under investigation by a grand jury in Mesa County, was barred by Griswold from overseeing the 2021 election, and Griswold is seeking the same for the 2022 elections.

Klotz said in an email late Thursday he was ""not free to discuss the case"" because of the pending lawsuit.

""I would suggest you familiarize yourself with the case,"" he said.

“As Secretary of State, I will continue to protect Colorado’s election infrastructure to ensure that every eligible Coloradan – Republican, Democrat, and Independent, alike – has access to secure elections,” Griswold said in a statement.",Q1

Minnesota bishop barred from diocese he once led

» Continue to this story on Crux

CWN Editor's Note: Bishop Michael Hoeppner has been directed not to return to the diocese of Crookston, Minnesota, which he led until his resignation last April.



Bishop Andrew Cozzens, his successor, said that Bishop Hoeppner “agreed not to return to do any ministry” in Crookston, and disclosed that the former bishop’s retirement compensation has been decreased.



Bishop Hoeppner resigned after a Vos Estis investigation found that he had mishandled sex-abuse complaints. He was charged with clearing a priest for ministry despite knowledge that the priest had abused a young man; he also allegedly pressured the victim to withdraw his complaint.

Moderna COVID-19 shots may soon be available for kids age 6 and younger in Illinois. (Shutterstock)

ILLINOIS — COVID-19 vaccine-maker Moderna said Wednesday that its trials show the shots are effective in babies, toddlers and preschoolers, and that it will ask federal regulators to authorize use of its child-sized two-dose shots in children 6 and younger.



The drugmaker also plans to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize the emergency use of a larger two-dose shot for older children and teens. Similar requests will be made to regulators in Europe, the company said. Two things must occur before young children in Illinois can start getting the shots:

The FDA must authorize the emergency use of the vaccine;

If that happens, the Centers for Disease Control must decide whether to recommend it. The nation’s approximately 18 million children ages 6 months to 5 years — are the only age group not yet approved for COVID-19 vaccines. Health experts say young children are part of the COVID-19 chain and transmission, and getting shots in their arms will help reduce coronavirus rates in Illinois and elsewhere around the country. In February, Moderna competitor Pfizer paused its application seeking emergency authorization to offer toddler-sized doses to children under 5. The FDA said at the time it wanted more data on the efficacy of a three-dose series of the vaccine for children ages 6 months to 4 years. A third dose ""may provide a higher level of protection in this age group,"" the company said in a statement.

Pfizer already has received emergency use authorization for its kid-sized doses for school-age children and full-strength doses for those 12 and older. Vaccinating the nation’s youngest children “has been somewhat of a moving target over the last couple of months,” Dr. Bill Muller of Northwestern University, an investigator in Moderna’s pediatric studies, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “There’s still, I think, a lingering urgency to try to get that done as soon as possible.”

Moderna said early data showed that two weeks after getting the two shots, 6,900 tots enrolled in its study showed youngsters developed virus-fighting antibody levels as strong as young adults getting its full-strength shots, the company said in a news release. The only side effects, Moderna said, were mild fevers similar to those associated with other common pediatric vaccines.

Children don’t generally get as sick with COVID-19 as to adults, but about 400 children younger than five have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to CDC data. Children were hit especially hard by the omicron variant, and children under 5 were hospitalized at higher rates than during the peak of the previous delta surge, according to the CDC. New COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths have been trending downward as the third year of the pandemic begins and Americans learn to live with the virus. There are a couple of troubling signs, though. First, “stealth omicron,” a variant within a variant known as BA.2, has made its way to the United States. Second, an extra-contagious delta-omicron hybrid, commonly called “deltacron,” may soon push up U.S. cases. Although the number of people with the coronavirus in Illinois hospitals is continuing to drop, state public health officials are closely monitoring the BA.2 omicron subvariant of COVID-19 and preparing for the possibility of a new wave of coronavirus infections.

""The virus is very much still here and with us, and it isn't going away, but with vaccines, with the existing variants that we have, they're manageable,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday.



Also, COVID-19 vaccines in general fend don’t fend off BA.2 as well as earlier variants, but do offer strong protection against severe COVID-19 illness, according to the CDC. Scientists are keeping an eye on deltracron, which shows how wily the coronavirus can be. Dr. Eric Topol, the head of Scripps Research Translational Institute, told The Associated Press a deltacron wave is “inevitable,” especially now that COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted and Americans are returning maskless to restaurants, bars, sporting events and other indoor activities. Moderna conducted its trial during the omicron surge. There were no severe illnesses, and the vaccine was about 44 percent effective at preventing any infection in babies up to age 2, and nearly 38 percent effective in preschoolers. Also Wednesday, Moderna said it is asking the FDA to clear the use of larger doses for older children, and half-sized doses for 6- to 11-year-olds. Moderna’s request to expand shots to 12- to 17-year-olds has been stalled for months over FDA concern about a very rare side effect, an inflammation of the heart that sometimes occurs in teens and young adults, mostly males, after receiving either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.",Q1
https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/world/suicide-bombing-kills-56-at-shiite-mosque-in-pakistan-and-wounding-194-people/,Suicide bombing kills 56 at mosque in Pakistan,"A suicide bomber struck inside a Shiite Muslim mosque in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar during Friday prayers, killing at least 56 worshippers and wounding 194 people, hospital officials said.

No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Both the Islamic State group and the Pakistani Taliban — a militant group separate from the Taliban in Afghanistan — have carried out similar attacks in the past in the area, located near the border with Afghanistan.

According to the spokesman at Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital, Asim Khan, many of the wounded were in critical condition. Scores of victims were peppered with shrapnel, several had limbs amputated and others were injured by flying debris.

Peshawar Police Chief Muhammed Ejaz Khan said the violence started when an armed attacker opened fire on police outside the mosque in Peshawar's old city. One policeman was killed in the gunfight, and another police officer was wounded. The attacker then ran inside the mosque and detonated his suicide vest.

The device was hidden beneath a large black shawl that covered much of the attacker's body, according to CCTV footage seen by The Associated Press. The footage showed the bomber moving quickly up a narrow street toward the mosque entrance. He fired at the police protecting the mosque before entering inside.

Within seconds, a powerful explosion occurred and the camera lens was obscured with dust and debris. Ansari said the crudely made device was packed with ball bearings, a deadly method of constructing a bomb to inflict the most carnage spraying a larger area with deadly projectiles. The ball bearings caused the high death toll, Ansari said.

Local police official Waheed Khan said the explosion occurred as worshippers had gathered in the Kucha Risaldar Mosque for Friday prayers. There are fears the death toll could still rise further, he added.

Ambulances rushed through congested narrow streets carrying the wounded to Lady Reading Hospital, where doctors worked feverishly.

Shayan Haider, a witness, had been preparing to enter the mosque when a powerful explosion threw him to the ground. ""I opened my eyes and there was dust and bodies everywhere,"" he said.

At the Lady Reading Hospital Emergency department, there was chaos as doctors struggled to move the many wounded into operating theaters. Hundreds of relatives gathered outside the emergency department, many of them wailing and beating their chests, pleading for information about their loved ones.

Outside the mosque, Shiites pressed through the cordoned-off streets. Kucha Risaldar Mosque is one of the oldest in the area, predating the creation of Pakistan in 1947 as a separate homeland for the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.

The prayer leader, Allama Irshad Hussein Khalil, a prominent up and coming young Shiite leader, was among the dead. Throughout the city, ambulance sirens could be heard.

Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the bombing. His national security adviser, Moeed Yusuf, said the bombing was a ""heinous terrorist attack"" and promised that those behind the carnage would ""be brought to justice.

""We will not allow our gains against terrorism & our internal security to be compromised at any cost,"" Yusuf tweeted.

Retired army officer Sher Ali who had been inside the mosque at the time of the explosion was injured by flying shrapnel. He made a impassioned plea to the Pakistani government for better protection of the country's minority Shiites.

""What is our sin? What have we done? Aren't we citizens of this country?"" he said from inside the emergency department, his white clothes splattered with blood.

Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the attack, saying the perpetrators were intent on ""sowing discord among Muslims."" In a statement on the ministry's website, spokesman Saeed Khatizadeh expressed his hope that Pakistan's government puts an end to such attacks with ""firm actions,"" without elaborating.

In majority Sunni Pakistan, minority Shiites have come under repeated attacks. Also, in recent months, the country has experienced a significant increase of violence and dozens of military personnel have been killed in scores of attacks on army outposts along the border with Afghanistan.

Many attacks have been claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, who analysts say have been emboldened by the Afghan Taliban seizing power last August in Afghanistan.

Pakistan has urged Afghanistan's new rulers to handover Pakistani Taliban militants who have been staging their attacks from Afghanistan. The Afghan Taliban have said their territory will not be used to stage attacks against anyone, but until now have not handed over any wanted Pakistani militants.

https://www.stargazette.com/story/news/coronavirus/2022/01/27/covid-mask-mandate-hochul-new-york-compliance/9226641002/,Q&A: Masks are (mostly) back in New York. What's next for Gov. Kathy Hochul's mandate?,"Gov. Kathy Hochul's indoor mask mandate is back, for now, as New York courts decide its fate. Hochul on Friday extended the indoor business mandate until Feb. 10. It will be reviewed every two weeks, the governor said, to decide on further extensions.

For schools, an indoor mask mandate is in effect until Feb. 21, unless the courts or Hochul make a change first.

Meanwhile, businesses and county officials are again figuring out enforcement – or not. A state Supreme Court judge yanked the regulations Monday, but by Tuesday, a higher court judge issued a ""stay,"" allowing the mandate to stand until the courts figure out its future. A state Appellate Court justice held a procedural hearing Friday morning.

Rockland County spokesman John Lyon said Wednesday that even with the court's stay, the local health department has ""paused"" its efforts to ensure local businesses understand the state's mask requirements while the court challenge continues.

Businesses, from grocery stores to bars, have had to balance reminding patrons to wear masks with worker concerns about pushback. Stefanie Shuman, external communications manager for Stop & Shop grocery stores, said Thursday that stores continued to require all customers, associates, and vendors, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a mask while in our stores.

""Regarding enforcement, we will not ask our associates to put their safety at risk by confronting customers about wearing masks,"" Shuman said, ""and we appreciate the cooperation of everyone inside our stores with this state mandate.""

The Rochester City School District was one of many districts that remained steadfast on their mask requirements even when the rules were technically scrapped by the court. ""Wearing a mask that covers your nose, mouth, and chin is a requirement for all students, staff, and visitors in the RCSD,"" a notice on the district website said Tuesday and Wednesday.

Here's what you need to know about where things stand with the statewide mask mandate.

More on mandate in court:New York's mask mandate still alive; judge issues stay on decision throwing it out

Mandate enforcement:New York mask mandate in effect, but some counties won’t enforce it. What to know.

What did New York's original mask mandates cover?

Hochul's masking rules started last month amid the omicron surge.

As of Dec. 13, 2021, businesses, restaurants and other public spaces have had to require masks indoors or proof of full vaccination against COVID.

The mandate allowed penalties, including a maximum fine of $1,000 for each violation, according to the governor’s office. Westchester County Executive George Latimer said Wednesday that he doesn't believe his health department has had to issue a single fine.

Schools were already following indoor masking requirements for students, faculty and staff set by the state Health Department at the start of the school year.

What happened with New York's mask mandate in court?

A Supreme Court judge in Nassau County had ruled Monday that the state Health Department's order, which allowed Hochul's mask mandate, was unlawful.

That decision is being challenged by state Attorney General Letitia James.

On Tuesday, Justice Robert J. Miller of the Appellate Court, Second Division, granted a stay.

Miller had scheduled a procedural hearing on Friday.

Whatever happens at the Appellate level, court challenges on the mask mandate could continue.

""What I think this has turned into is the argument over the concept of a mandate from people who are conservative,"" said Latimer, a self-described progressive Democrat. ""This is an ideological and political reaction ... from people who really object to the fact that COVID isn't just ignored and we go back to our lives.""

NY shells out $65M to local leaders:NY won't conduct spot checks on masks, provides $65M for counties enforcing mandate

So what's next for the mask mandate?

Hochul announced Friday during a weather briefing on Long Island that the indoor mask mandate was extended through Feb. 10, despite a ""little blip,"" referring to the ongoing court challenge. She lauded New York State Attorney General Letitia James for challenging the earlier state Supreme Court ruling, which brought a stay in that decision.

""Let's continue to wear a mask,"" Hochul said Friday. ""The ones that make a difference, the N95.""

The governor then referred to an upcoming federal free mask distribution that is due to start in New York any day. Masks will be given out at pharmacies and other locations where COVID vaccinations and boosters are available. Locations can found at vaccines.gov.

The challenge comes as COVID cases are quickly dropping.

Hochul reported Friday that the state's seven-day positivity rate was 6.15%. Case counts, she said, are coming down rapidly. On Wednesday, that positivity rate – which is the percentage of COVID tests that showed a positive result for the virus – was 9.1%. On Jan. 7, the statewide positivity rate topped 22%.

Latimer said that as cases drop – and hospitalization rates decrease, especially in areas with high vaccination rates – there will be less need for mask mandates.

What have local officials been saying about the mandate?

When Hochul announced a new round of masking rules, several Republican county executives around the state blasted the mandate and said their county health departments wouldn't enforce it.

County leaders said they didn't have the money or staff as local health departments were stretched thin during the pandemic. Some said they believed vaccination efforts took precedence.

Rockland County Executive Ed Day went on FOX Business on Dec. 14 and called Hochul's policy tone deaf. Day, a Republican, said local governments weren't consulted and the decision was ripped from the ""failed playbook of a predecessor,"" referring to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

Then in early January, Day announced that Rockland's health department would ramp up indoor mask compliance efforts after the county applied for $1 million in state grants. He said the money would help cover staffing costs for vaccination efforts and mask-or-vaccine mandate enforcement.

After Monday's Supreme Court ruling but before Tuesday afternoon's stay, Rockland officials said those mask education efforts were on hold.

What's the latest on masks in schools?

School districts across the state reacted differently to Monday's decision.

A few, including on Long Island where the court challenge started, had allowed optional mask use on Tuesday.

But most followed the advice of the New York State Education Department that the mask rules should remain in place as a stay was expected.

In Clarkstown, parents reported on Tuesday that they were being called to school to pick up children who weren't wearing masks.

By Tuesday night, most districts were sending notes to their communities saying that the mandate was still in place because of the Appellate Court's stay.

New Rochelle was among school districts that initially said Tuesday they didn't have authority to mandate masks, but asked for continued compliance. By late Tuesday, district said masks were again required indoors.

""We have heard from many community members regarding masking in schools, and we recognize and respect each personal position,"" said a New Rochelle district statement posted late Tuesday. ""However, the court-ordered stay means that the masking policy remains in force and effect.""

The statement added: ""This guidance may change again quickly.""

(Part one),"MANILA, Philippines—The four-day uprising now known as the Edsa People Power Revolution on Feb. 22 to 25, 1986 led to the collapse of the regime of Ferdinand Marcos.

The momentous event was witnessed by millions in the Philippines and elsewhere. The peaceful protests, considered a remarkable moment in Philippine history, have retained their relevance 36 years after the events unfolded on Edsa, which is now infamous for traffic congestion.

Article continues after this advertisement

While millions of Filipinos from all walks of life marched on Edsa to join protests against controversial results of snap elections called by Marcos, some personalities stuck out because of their roles in the historic event.

In this article, INQUIRER.net will list down some of the prominent figures that were on either side of the fence during those momentous times.

Corazon “Cory” Aquino

Widow of opposition leader Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., the staunchest critic of Marcos—who was assassinated on Aug. 21, 1983, on his return from exile in the United States.

In 1986, when Marcos called for snap presidential elections, she was chosen as the opposition’s presidential candidate, with former senator Salvador “Doy” Laurel as her vice president.

Amid allegations of widespread fraud and violence, Marcos was declared the winner of the Feb. 7, 1986 snap elections. Tally of votes made by the National Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) disputed official results from the Commission on Elections (Comelec). Cory led a protest rally, attended by an estimated 4 million people at that time, at Rizal Park to claim victory in the snap elections and vow to lead a civil disobedience campaign.

By Day 4 of the Edsa uprising, on Feb. 25, Aquino took her oath as president before Supreme Court Senior Justice Claudio Teehankee at Club Filipino. She served as the 11th President of the Philippines from Feb. 25, 1986 to June 30, 1992, becoming the country’s first female head of state.

Article continues after this advertisement

Aquino’s image as an icon of democracy endured after the end of her term.

She was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2008 and died in 2009 at age 76.

Ferdinand Marcos

Elected president in 1965 and declared martial law in September 1972. Marcos held on to his post as president until he and his family were forced to flee the country in 1986 during the People Power Revolution.

A few minutes before noon on Feb. 25, Marcos was sworn into office by then-Chief Justice Ramon C. Aquino. As Marcos raised his hand to take his oath, the live television coverage of the event was abruptly cut when military rebels supporting the Edsa uprising disabled the transmitter serving then Marcos-controlled Channels 2, 9 and 13. The broadcast was disrupted for 20 minutes after which Chief Justice Aquino was called back to reenact the oath-taking of Marcos.

For the first time in Philippine history, the country had two individuals claiming the presidency.

Later that day, Marcos, his family, and close allies fled to Hawaii. Marcos died in exile there on Sept. 28, 1989.

On Nov. 18, 2016, Marcos was buried with military honors at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, a graveyard for soldiers who gave up their lives for the country and statesmen who are considered heroes. The burial was met with protests.

Imelda Marcos

On Day 4 of the Edsa uprising, the former first lady—who was renowned for her vast shoe collection—was reported to be initially reluctant to leave the Palace and seemed in denial about the situation.

According to “Chronology of a Revolution” by Angela Stuart Santiago, moments after Marcos took oath as president at the Malacañang Ceremonial Hall on Feb. 25, an impeccably groomed Imelda, who was seen wearing an immaculate white terno, led the crowd in singing her theme song, “Dahil Sa Iyo.”

Before the family left the Palace, she handed out payroll envelopes with P10,000 each to the remaining Palace personnel.

She was exiled in Hawaii with her husband after their ouster in 1986. Six years later, in 1991, she was allowed to go back to the Philippines. A year after her return, Imelda announced that she was running for president. Her presidential bid, however, failed and she finished fifth in a field of six candidates.

In 1995, Imelda won a congressional seat after a landslide victory in her home province of Leyte. In 2013, Imelda was re-elected for another three years.

She was allowed to post bail following a conviction for seven graft cases on humanitarian grounds because of her age.

Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.

The only son of the Marcos couple. On the last day of the uprising, he was seen dressed in fatigues while protecting his father as the family left Malacañang on the evening of Feb. 25, 1986.

Since the family’s return from exile, Marcos Jr. has served as congressman of Ilocos Norte’s second district (1992-1995, 2007-2010) and Ilocos Norte governor for three consecutive terms (1998-2007). In 2010, he was elected as senator.

He ran for vice president in 2016 as running mate of the late senator Miriam Defensor Santiago but lost the elections to Leni Robredo by a margin of 263,473.

Marcos Jr. is now running for president and is considered a frontrunner.

He is currently running alongside his running mate Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the President’s daughter.

Imee Marcos-Manotoc

On the evening of Feb. 25, Imee—Marcos’ eldest daughter—and her sister Irene were in tears, pleading with their father to leave for the US amid his vow to die in the Palace. Tommy Manotoc relayed the offer of US Brig. Gen. Ted Allen for the family to use American helicopters or boats to move Marcos out.

She was a Kabataang Barangay head and Ilocos Norte assemblywoman from 1984 to 1986. In 1998, she returned to politics as Ilocos Norte’s second district representative. She served as governor of Ilocos Norte in 2013 and was elected to the Senate in 2019.

She has been actively campaigning for her brother, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., in the presidential race.

Col. Jose Almonte

One of the founders of Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM), Almonte warned then opposition leader Corazon Aquino, her brother Jose Cojuangco and the late Jaime Cardinal Sin about an impending event in the third week of February 1986. He also offered to provide security to Aquino.

During the term of former President Cory Aquino, he was the first to be promoted general and served as head of the Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau after his retirement from military service.

He also served as the chief security adviser of President Fidel Ramos from 1992 to 1998.

In 2016, he was among the list of personalities invited to speak about President Rodrigo Duterte’s performance during his first 100 days as president. Almonte described Duterte’s first 100 days as “exceptional” but suggested less “colorful language.”

Eugenia Apostol

The founding chair of the Philippine Daily Inquirer and publisher of the tabloid Mr. & Ms. Special Editions, two of the leading papers that openly opposed the Marcos regime.

On the afternoon of Feb. 22, Apostol was in the Inquirer office with colleagues the late Betty Go Belmonte and Lita Logarta when she got a call from Cristina Enrile, wife of then defense chief Juan Ponce Enrile, informing her about Enrile’s arrest.

“Will you help us? Will you call the cardinal for us?” she asked Apostol. According to Apostol, they did try to call Cardinal Jaime Sin but failed to talk to him.

“So I told Betty and Lita Logarta to handle that part of it, to try to get hold of the cardinal, while I ran to Cristina in Dasmarinas Village,” Apostol stated in the “Chronology of a Revolution.”

“On my way out, I passed by the desk of Louie Beltran who was our editor then and I told him what was happening. Of course, nobody knew why Johnny was going to be arrested, everybody just knew he was going to be arrested,” she added.

From Feb. 23 to 25, Inquirer had to publish three Extra editions to report the news as soon as it happened.

In 2016, Apostol and Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc, the late Inquirer editor in chief, were given the People Power Award for their courage in fighting martial law through their journalism that stirred up protests against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.

Agapito “Butz” Aquino

Brother of Ninoy Aquino and the founding member of the August 21 Movement (Atom), which was established after Ninoy’s assassination. After declaring Atom’s support for the Enrile-Ramos group, Butz was the first to ask people, including other anti-Marcos groups, to convene in Cubao.

He served as senator from 1987 to 1995. He died on Aug. 17, 2015 at the age of 76.

Rodolfo Biazon

A Marine commander based in Davao City who was convinced by businessman Chito Ayala to protect Corazon Aquino in her civil disobedience campaign in the city. Biazon’s aide had learned of the plans and was ordered by his superiors to shoot Biazon if he defected. Biazon’s defection to the Enrile-Ramos side was announced on radio but later reports said that he had not done so.

He served as superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) from 1986 to 1987, commandant of the Philippine Marines from 1987 to 1989, vice chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) from 1990 to 1991, and AFP chief of staff from Jan. 24, 1991 to Apr. 12, 1991 under then-President Cory Aquino.

From 1992 to 1995, he served as senator, was reelected in 1998, and served in office until 2010. He became representative of Muntinlupa’s lone district from 2010 to 2016.

Earlier this month, Biazon, along with other former government officials and business executives, signed a joint statement and made an appeal to Filipinos to join them in supporting Robredo’s presidential bid.

Braulio Balbas Jr.

A deputy commandant of the Philippine Marines during Edsa, two battalions under him were given the mission of assaulting and seizing the Ministry of Defense Building at Camp Aguinaldo. He was repeatedly ordered by Maj Gen Josephus Ramas, then commanding general of the Philippine Army, to fire his howitzers at Camp Crame. Balbas hesitated and reported that he was still positioning the howitzers.

Before noon, Balbas received a call from Artemio Tadiar. He was instructed to withdraw and take the unit back to Fort Bonifacio. Upon arrival, he was relieved of his command of the 4th Marine Provisional Brigade and reverted back to his regular assignment as commanding officer of the Combat Service Support Brigade.

Balbas’ decision not to fire his howitzers was a critical moment that eventually led to the peaceful end of the crisis.

He retired as head of Western Command in Palawan with the rank of brigadier general.

June Keithley-Castro

Despite the prevailing media censorship, Keithley—a radio broadcaster during the Edsa uprising—gave blow-by-blow reports of the peaceful revolution. After announcing their breakaway from Marcos on Feb. 22, Enrile and Ramos asked Fr. James Reuter to have someone go on air to give guidance to the people. Keithley was sent to the Church-run Radio Veritas, which had broadcast Cardinal Sin’s historic appeal for the people to go to Edsa.

After government forces shut down Radio Veritas, Keithley and her team moved to the dzRJ facilities in Sta. Mesa, Manila. To keep their location secret, the group used the Veritas’ frequency of 840 and took the name “Radyo Bandido.”

She died on Nov. 24, 2013 at the age of 66 after a lingering battle with cancer.

Keithley was awarded the People Power Award after her death.

Juan Ponce Enrile

Marcos’ defense minister and a central figure in the coup plot against him with rebel troops from RAM. It was planned at 2 a.m. of Feb. 23, 1986, but was discovered the day before. Hours after the discovery, Enrile withdrew support from Marcos along with Fidel Ramos, then vice chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. They also recognized Cory Aquino as the duly elected President.

A few years after, Enrile would be among those charged with rebellion and murder for his alleged participation in a military coup against Aquino in December 1989.

He served as senator from 1987 to 1992, 1995 to 2001, and 2004 to 2016. From 1992 to 1995, he also became representative of Cagayan’s first district.

The 98-year-old Enrile, during his recent birthday celebration, endorsed Marcos Jr. as “the next president from the North.”

Bounome Chanphouang ’23

Office of Veteran and Military Affairs Undergraduate Student Veteran Scholarship

While he was on active duty, Chanphouang participated in the military visual journalism program in the Newhouse School. “It was my snippet of college, and I loved it,” he says. “The Newhouse School’s television, radio and film program truly helped me grow as a videographer and a storyteller.”

He applied his skills at American Forces Network (AFN) in Naples, Italy, and finished his active service at AFN Souda Bay in 2020. He returned to Syracuse University after an honorable discharge to pursue his degree and continues to serve in the Navy reserve. He appreciates the University’s many opportunities for veterans and how his overall experience has been safe and inclusive as well.

“I’m glad I came back to complete my studies as a more well-rounded adult,” he says. He believes the Navy instilled his strong leadership skills and gave him opportunities to continue his success at Syracuse University.

The OVMA Undergraduate Student Veteran Scholarship will help give him peace of mind and assist with financial commitments. After he graduates, Chanphouang plans to use his advanced videography and content creation skills to travel the world in search of interesting people with stories to tell.

Kamileh Rivera ’23

Office of Veteran and Military Affairs Military Family Member Scholarship

Coming to Syracuse University from Puerto Rico was a big mental and physical transition for Rivera. The daughter of a veteran, Rivera came alone to a new environment, which she says was scary enough, not to mention learning the ins and outs of college life.

“It was definitely a big moment for me, yet I knew Syracuse had this amazing support system that I could lean on at any time,” she says.

The donor-funded scholarship will help to relieve financial hardships for her and her family. Also, “it’s rewarding to know that someone believes in my education,” she says. “I feel honored to be chosen and will not take this opportunity for granted.”

Rivera plans to continue her education and pursue a master’s degree in public health and attend medical school to become a doctor. “Back home in Puerto Rico, we have a great medical professional deficit, and my goal after graduating from medical school is to go home and give back to the community that saw me grow up and develop into the woman I am today.”

Megan Neuman L’23

Gerald B. Faigle Jr. and Roberta M. Faigle Student Veteran Endowed Scholarship

As a military spouse, Neuman understands how military service comes with unique sacrifices. Her husband is a structural engineer, serves in the New York National Guard and recently deployed for months in support of COVID relief. She takes military-connected challenges in stride and focuses even more on her demanding coursework.

“Making the Dean’s List the first semester of the first year in law school was a major accomplishment for me,” she says. “That, coupled with receiving the top grade in a required first-year course, solidified all the hard work that semester…we made the best of it.”

Neuman describes the financial stress this award helps to alleviate as unquantifiable.

“This scholarship helps ease the burden of my husband’s irregular schedule, and he can go on orders knowing our financial situation at home is more secure,” she says. Neuman is looking forward to working with her father, who also graduated from the Syracuse University College of Law, to continue the family business.

Gracie Guilette ’24

Richardson Family Scholarship for Military Family Members and Dependents

Attending Syracuse University first as a remote student while weathering the pandemic and working a part-time job in her native Wisconsin was challenging for Guilette. She finished high school with a year of college credits, which enabled her to take a gap semester to work as a long-term preschool substitute teacher. She knows that her experience tested her drive, grit and academic strength, and it also made her a better student.

“Now that I am finally on campus as a sophomore, I am incredibly grateful to have been given the chance to come and study in such an amazing atmosphere,” she says. “I learn new things every day, challenge myself to work harder and am truly becoming the person I was born to be.”

Guilette is a dependent of an Army National Guard veteran. With a dual major in applied data analytics and finance, Guilette envisions a career in financial technology where she can give back to the communities that raised her and uplift those with less experience.

“This scholarship will drastically impact the course of my studying,” she says. “It will allow me to continue to pursue my education, take the financial hardships and pressure off, fully focus on my studies and truly embrace my role as a student at the university.”

Hakim Morris ’24

Lois A. and Patricia H. Mautino Veteran Endowed Scholarship

Morris served in the Army for just under four years before coming to Syracuse as a full-time student. He is proud to have successfully balanced his online college classes with an extremely demanding work environment while deployed overseas.

Transitioning to college life on campus has been a challenge, and support from the Student Veterans Organization and other resources have made Syracuse University a great fit for him.

Morris is interested in policy studies and hopes to continue his education in law school and practice corporate law. So far, he’s had a chance to explore his interests in media and writing through Citrus TV and Renegade Magazine. He works several jobs as well, and he sees this scholarship as an opportunity to further his education while having more time to study and pursue his academic goals.

With this award, “I am one step closer to achieving my ultimate goal of helping others and making an impact,” he says.

Jesus Adkins ’23

Flanik Family Scholarship for Student Veterans

Adkins credits his Syracuse University education with putting a world perspective on what he does in the military. Adkins served in the Navy on board the USS Tennessee as a machinist mate and serves on active duty as the quality assurance inspector for Trident Refit Facility Kings Bay in Georgia.

After he finishes his undergraduate studies, Adkins plans to apply to Officer Candidate School and continue his Navy service. “I feel that I’ve had so much help in my life, and now I want to give back to the absolute best of my ability,” he says.

This scholarship has eased the financial burden of higher education and bolstered Adkins’ confidence as a student. Along the way, Adkins’ proudest accomplishment has been his family. “Focusing on what matters most is the best anyone can ever hope to do,” he says. “For me, that focus is my family.”

Curtis Cline ’25

Wilder J. Leavitt and Mary P. Morningstar Scholarship for Military-Connected Students

While he was stationed at Fort Drum, New York, Cline experienced Syracuse University when his daughter came to Upstate University Golisano Children’s Hospital for a minor procedure, and he ventured onto campus. “The area, people, architecture and school pride won me over immediately,” he says. “At that moment I knew I would be a student here someday.”

With 11 years of active-duty Army experience as an Apache helicopter maintainer and three combat tours, Cline is drawn to staying within the rotary aircraft and defense contracting industry.

He’s also compelled to work in space exploration as part of an innovative team. Either way, he knows his major in aerospace engineering will enable him to pursue advanced degrees and prepare him for numerous exciting paths.

“Everyone I’ve encountered is motivated and gives their all,” he says. “In this short time, I have grown great respect for the university.”

“I took a leap of faith when I decided to become a full-time student,” he says. He credits the Wilder J. Leavitt and Mary P. Morningstar Scholarship for Military-Connected Students with helping him focus on his education, alleviate financial risk and stay on his path to success. “I can ensure I made the right decision,” he says.

Cayden Lombard ’24

Wilder J. Leavitt and Mary P. Morningstar Scholarship for Military-Connected Students

Lombard is a decorated second-year scholar, earning distinctions for academic achievement, fitness and spirit. As a member of Air Force ROTC, he plans to commission as an officer upon graduation, working in Air Force cybersecurity. He credits his military experience with helping him recognize that today’s sacrifices help him to prepare a better future.

“My time here has shaped me to believe that I am capable of doing incredible things if I put time and effort into them,” he says. “I have had an overall positive experience because of the friendships I’ve made and mentors I’ve med throughout both Army and Air Force ROTC.

Lombard appreciates the Wilder J. Leavitt and Mary P. Morningstar Scholarship for Military-Connected Students as an opportunity to lower his post-graduation debt and put him on path to one day give back to the community that supported him.

“It shows support for the military as a whole and encourages those who serve to never stop moving forward,” he says.",Q1
https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/21/the-guardian-wins-george-polk-award-for-pegasus-project-investigation,The Guardian joint winner of George Polk award for Pegasus project,"What is in the data leak?

The data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group, which sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers were selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses.

What does the leak indicate?

The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the phone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and US numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with Pegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds.

What did forensic analysis reveal?

Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30, the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages.

Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic methods, and found them to be sound.

Which NSO clients were selecting numbers?

While the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its tools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO.

What does NSO Group say?

You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s technology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that anyone could search on an open source system. After further questions, the lawyers said the consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies”. Following publication, they explained that they considered a ""target"" to be a phone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus, and reiterated that the list of 50,000 phones was too large for it to represent ""targets"" of Pegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative of whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus.

What is HLR lookup data?

The term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and their general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.",Q1
https://www.city-journal.org:443/bayron-nieves-murder-and-da-braggs-memo,Having It Bragg’s Way,"Last Monday, new Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg released his “Day 1” memo, instructing prosecutors to downgrade charges against armed robbers who threaten store employees. Five days later, 19-year-old Kristal Bayron-Nieves was working the Saturday-night shift at a Harlem Burger King, just weeks into her new job, when an armed robber shot her to death. Bayron-Nieves’s murder is a viciously timely example of how Bragg’s hopelessly naïve approach to parsing crime—adopting the robber’s classic excuse, “I didn’t mean to hurt anyone”—will result in more bloodshed and, ironically for a progressive prosecutor determined to reduce incarceration, in more young men going to prison.

Bragg’s Monday memo couldn’t have been clearer. “An act that could be charged” as armed robbery “in a commercial setting” should be downgraded to a misdemeanor larceny, he wrote, “if the force or threat of force consists of displaying a dangerous instrument or similar behavior but does not create a genuine risk of physical harm.”

Of the long menu of Bragg’s new “do-not-prosecute” directives, this one got the most attention, almost all of it negative—so much so that a “surprised” Bragg quickly backtracked after what he called a “long week.” “If you go into the store in Manhattan and used a gun to rob that store, that is armed robbery, that is serious and we will be prosecuting armed robbery in Manhattan,” he was telling Al Sharpton by Saturday morning.

Bragg tried to spin the public reaction to the memo as a misinterpretation, but it wasn’t. The memo referenced three statutes, the first of which specifically lists “pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm” as its sole examples of “deadly weapons” used during the course of a robbery. The memo listed no exemption under which assistant DAs should continue to prosecute gun robberies as felonies. Nor did the memo ever seek to reconcile the obvious inconsistency, even without reference to the statutes: someone “displaying a dangerous instrument” is, by definition, posing a danger. Nor can an observer blame the language on a simple oversight: Bragg had two months to prepare his big reveal. No, the flip-flop was exactly what it looked like: Bragg, who already appears to be in over his head in his new job, was shaken by the bad reaction and changed his mind.

Let’s hope his mind stays changed—and changes further. The only reason a robber ever displays, brandishes, or points a weapon at a store clerk is to create the fear of grievous or deadly violence. “He’s not really going to stab me” is probably not the wisest reaction to someone waving a knife in your face. All robbery victims, even when they escape physically unscathed, thus experience “a genuine risk of physical harm.”

Bragg also neglected the fact that recidivist criminals know exactly what they can get away with. If someone commits an armed robbery in which no one is harmed, and skates on a misdemeanor, he’ll do it again. Do this enough, and someone will get hurt. The “botched robbery” or “robbery gone wrong” narrative is a perennial media error: all robberies have “gone wrong” from the start. A victim resists, or doesn’t comply fast enough with a robber’s demands, and is shot or stabbed; a robber thinks the victim has seen too much of his face and fires his weapon.

Bayron-Nieves’s preventable violent death at Burger King was exactly why prosecutors charge armed robbers who target stores with felonies, whether they are brandishing guns, knives, or hammers—even when no one gets hurt. In the Harlem Burger King case, witnesses told the New York Post that the robber “turned to leave” after taking $100 in cash, but then he “whipped around again and shot Bayron-Nieves in the torso.” Whether the killer set out to pose “a genuine risk of physical harm” with his “dangerous instrument,” or whether he panicked or got angry for some reason and pulled the trigger, is irrelevant.

Tolerating armed robberies is an especially misapplied strategy when the entire point of this turnaround, according to Bragg, is so that mentally ill or addicted suspects can get help rather than punishment. “I will divert most mental health and addiction cases away” from the justice system, Bragg said during the campaign. Yet repeat armed robbers aren’t mentally incompetent. They are not suffering from delusions. They can distinguish right from wrong, cause from effect. Someone who has the foresight to procure a weapon, conceal it in street travel, and use it to steal from store workers has already passed several competency tests. He can plan ahead. He has a twisted ability to understand how other people think: he knows his victims will react with fear, and thus likely comply with his demands. That the perpetrator prefers to engage in this wrong behavior to feed an addiction or because it is superior to other alternatives—like having to comply with social-services bureaucracies to secure food and shelter—is not a sign of mental breakdown but of free choice.

Nevertheless, even if one agrees with Bragg’s reasoning, he has already failed to follow through on the tactics. In between his memo and Bayron-Nieves’s murder last week, a robber allegedly threatened workers in a Manhattan T.J. Maxx store with scissors as he stole merchandise. Prosecutors, apparently following their boss’s new instructions, charged him only with shoplifting. The suspect went free without bail.

But this particular suspect has engaged in similar behavior before, and recently. He already faces multiple open cases for similar violent store robberies. What’s more likely: that the suspect is going to address his purported mental-illness and addiction problems on his own, or that he’s going to escalate this behavior until someone is hurt or killed? Then he’ll face a long prison sentence—but it will be too late for his victims. “These policy changes not only will, in and of themselves, make us safer; they also will free up prosecutorial resources to focus on violent crime,” says Bragg’s memo. Wrong: they will create more violent crime.

The public reaction last week to Bragg’s redefinition of armed robberies as misdemeanor shoplifting offenses obscured some of Bragg’s other changes, which apparently still stand. He’ll entirely forego prosecuting slews of “small crimes,” from farebeating (a continuation of his predecessor’s policy) to trespassing. Broken Windows theory—the presumption, now well-backed by decades of evidence, that such small crimes lead to larger crimes—is out.

After her daughter’s killing, Bayron-Nieves’s mother, Kristie Nieves, told the Post that she had repeatedly complained of feeling unsafe. She “already wanted off the late shift because she was so scared,” the Post wrote. Bayron-Nieves quite rationally understood that the small disorder she witnessed every day, spurring her to ask for more security, could portend bigger problems.

Nieves encouraged her daughter to go to work anyway, because, she recalled telling her, “you have to be responsible.” Who deserves the protection of the state—people conscientiously working to “get a better life,” as Nieves described her daughter, or people who have chosen to steal violently for a living? And why is it even necessary to ask this question?

https://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/how-i-met-your-father-is-not-for-cynics-and-thats-its-best-quality/article_232eef5c-a456-5b88-901f-c3e02670f9bf.html,‘How I Met Your Father’ is not for cynics — and that's its best quality,"Possibly under the theory that every generation entering its 30s will need the mirror of a situation comedy to recognize, admire or chuckle knowingly at itself, “How I Met Your Mother,” which ran on CBS from 2005 to 2014, has been rebooted by Hulu as “How I Met Your Father.” Like its structural model, it uses the framing device of a narrator from the future explaining what the title promises (Kim Cattrall in 2050, looking back on younger self Hillary Duff in 2022); is set in New York, in a world without COVID-19; and features a bar. (There is a hint at the end of the pilot that it occupies the same fictional universe as “How I Met Your Mother,” and a note to the press describes the new show as a “sequel,” but I’m happy to stick with “reboot.”)

An earlier mooted reboot, “How I Met Your Dad,” from “Mother” creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas and “Saturday Night Live” writer Emily Spivey, was set to follow hot on the heels of “Mother” but never made it past the pilot. And though I haven’t noticed the world clamoring these six years for someone to pick up that thread, it is not strange that Hulu, which streams “How I Met Your Mother,” might have seen the industrial wisdom in giving it this little sister. To be sure, the framing device is now just a gimmick to distinguish this ensemble fading-youth comedy, in which some characters live together and all of whom spend time in a place where drink and/or food is served, from other comedies whose characters do the same — while linking it to an earlier hit. But, after all, it has got our attention.

Duff plays Sophie, who, after 87 Tinder dates — “this year” — has made a love connection with Ian (Daniel Augustin), whom the script whisks out of the picture by the end of the pilot. (This does not count as a spoiler; boyfriends are always being whisked away in situation comedy, and he may be back.) Jesse (Chris Lowell) is internet famous for a rejected proposal (to Leighton Meester, in the briefest of cameos) caught on video.

Directed by Pamela Fryman, who helmed nearly every episode of “How I Met Your Mother,” it’s a looking-glass reboot. Sophie’s future self is onscreen, where, in “Mother,” narrator Ted’s was not; Ted’s future children were onscreen, where Sophie’s son is not. Where most of the main characters of “Mother” arrived with a long history together, the “Father” pilot is chockablock with new relationships. Sophie is picked up by Jesse in an Uber, in which his friend Sid (Suraj Sharma), who owns the series’ bar, is a passenger; her roommate Valentina (Francia Raisa) has returned from a trip to London with Charlie (Tom Ainsley), an aristocratic hunk, something like a cross between Bertie Wooster and Jethro Bodine, whom she has moved into their apartment; Ellen (Tien Tran), Jesse’s adopted sister, has moved to New York from Iowa to reconnect with him, but they are essentially strangers, having grown up separately after their parents’ divorce. (By the third episode, they’re cemented as a gang.) As a result, the pilot does a lot of heavy narrative lifting; subsequent episodes settle into more relaxed rhythms.

Not surprisingly — inevitably, even purposely — there is nothing particularly new here. Bays and Thomas were 29 when they wrote the “Mother” pilot, roughly the same age as their characters, and used themselves and their friends as models. Within the context of a network sitcom, it produced something that felt authentic and generationally fresh. Here, the pop cultural references feel like billboards.

The plots are the usual stuff of mainstream situation comedy — lies and misunderstandings, characters thrown into competition over this or that thing, or trying to seem something they’re not. There is a (double) spit take. That does not mean it’s difficult to watch; at worst, it’s pleasant, undemanding company that might ring some harmonious bells with viewers excited for a show that references Train’s “Drops of Jupiter,” Pabst Blue Ribbon and “7th Heaven.” It’s funny at times, and when it isn’t funny, it is usually at least sweet, which is no small thing.

Indeed, the series’ most appealing aspect — perhaps a legacy of its broadcast roots, or the fact that rebooters Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger were showrunners on NBC’s soft-center “This Is Us” — is its unwillingness to decouple sex from love. Sophie, despite her many bad dates, still wants to “find my person”; Jesse, despite his carapace of cynicism, is an emotional marshmallow. As in the “Mother” pilot, there is an engagement and a climactic rom-com mission. The word “monogamy” is spoken in a positive light.

Not to take the series more seriously than it merits, or asks, but if it has a theme — and it does return to this point often and explicitly — it’s the fearful onset of maturity. Valentina fears becoming “old and boring.” “We’re young,” says Sophie. “We can still make bad choices for a few more years.” Drew, a recurring character played by Josh Peck, is a relative grown-up: He takes taxis, specifies the year when he orders wine and, most importantly, understands when it’s time to let the wait staff go home, which attracts and muddles Sophie. Meanwhile, an even younger generation is represented by an NYU student who tends bar for Sid and says things like “simping” and “that’s fire.”

The cast members sit comfortably in their parts. I particularly enjoyed Ainsley, who answers in the affirmative the question of whether a buff man can be funny; Peck, a former child star like Duff, whose innate gentleness I find most pleasing; and especially Tran, who never acts as if she’s in a sitcom and, given a serious scene to play, pulls the show into a more naturalistic space — no mean trick.

The laugh track is a distraction for a while, because it is so obviously not the work of a studio audience. But this tends to fade into the background, like a not especially severe case of tinnitus.

But by the end of the year, it will be a second chance at life for homeless veterans in Horry County.

The Veterans Welcome Home Resource Center out of Little River is working on building 40 tiny homes in Myrtle Beach, along with 20 more tiny homes behind their offices in Little River. Of the 40 anticipated tiny homes, 25 have been approved so far.

The center, which opened in May of 2009, provides a variety of services for veterans such as financial services, disability claims, spouse benefits, housing, training programs that help with resumes and job placement. It also serves as a hub to direct veterans and their spouses to other agencies that can help.

Scott Dulebohn, the center’s director, said there are about 300 homeless veterans in Horry County and he expects those numbers to increase.

“We have eight veterans that live here right now and we’re out in the middle of nowhere,” Dulebohn anticipating more veterans would seek help when they see the Myrtle Beach village start to take shape within a month. “It’s going to explode,” he said.

Myrtle Beach city leaders, such as city councilman John Krajc, are excited to see what the village will bring to the neighborhood.

“I think the addition of a housing project, such as this, to serve those who have given so much of their life to our country and to our freedoms and protections is a great use for that land,” Krajc said.

Both the money to build the homes as well as the land was donated to the center anonymously by a veteran from South Carolina, said Dulebohn.

The homes are roughly 150 square feet with enough room for a futon or pull-out couch as well as a bathroom and sink. Dulebohn said the homes will be American Disabilities Act compliant. The homes will also include an HVAC system, donated by One Hour Heating and Air, according to Dulebohn.",Q1

A slew of U.S. bills aimed at prohibiting gender-affirming health care for trans youth are being proposed because ""opponents of LGBTQ equality are running out of ideas,"" says one advocate.

""This has been a growing trend over the course of the last several years, where we've seen opponents of LGBTQ equality really target transgender children,"" said Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.

Gender-affirming care includes treatments that transgender people undergo in order to transition, and may include hormone therapy or surgeries.

Oakley said her organization is tracking 21 bills that target the provision of this health care. None of the proposed legislation is currently in effect — a bill passed in Arkansas met with legal challenges — but Oakley said she's very concerned about the consequences if the laws are enacted.

In Idaho, there is a proposal to punish this health-care provision with up to life in prison; while in Texas, a judge has temporarily blocked a directive from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that parents who provide this care for their children be investigated for child abuse.

Oakley said anti-LGBT campaigners are exploiting a lack of public understanding about ""the nuts and bolts of what it means to be a trans kid,"" in order to sow fear among ""even fair-minded folks, who are in favour of equality.""

""This is about politicians who are trying to score political points on the backs of trans kids, and they just don't care about the consequences,"" she told The Current's Matt Galloway.

This month, Alabama state representatives advanced a bill that would make it punishable by up to 10 years in prison for a doctor to provide gender-affirming health care to a minor. The bill was sponsored by Republican state representative Wes Allen, who argues it's intended to protect children too young to make the decision, and is similar to legislation barring children from cigarettes and alcohol.

""It is not good to give these medications to these children, and I consider it to where it would be abuse to give these long-term drugs to these children,"" he told legislators earlier this month.

His position is not shared by some of the largest medical bodies in the U.S., including the American Medical Association, which has repeatedly opposed government intrusion as ""detrimental to the health of transgender and gender-diverse children and adults.""

In a letter to legislators last April, the AMA pointed to evidence ""that forgoing gender-affirming care can have tragic consequences,"" including higher levels of mental health disorders, and suicide.

In a separate statement reiterating its position in June, the organization stated that ""the majority of transgender and diverse-gender patients report improved mental health and lower rates of suicide after receipt of gender-affirming care.""

Elijah Bayy worries that the proposed legislation will have a harmful impact on trans youth who are still in the process of coming out. (Submitted by Elijah Bayy)

Bills 'scary and stressful' for trans kids

In Alabama, 18-year-old Elijah Baay says they feel lucky to have had a lot of support when they came out as non-binary — but they worry about the impact of the Alabama bill on younger people.

""I think mostly this has been harmful to people who are not out yet, because it is spreading a lot of misinformation to parents who may or may not be supportive,"" Baay said.

""It is difficult for them to convince their parents, like, no, the legislator is not correct in this situation.""

Oakley echoed those concerns, saying ""trans kids are being really impacted by this legislation, even if it doesn't pass, the conversation is scary and stressful and othering.""

Baay was intending to undergo top surgery this year before starting college. If the bill passes, they may travel out of state for the procedure, but said ""that just adds another layer of complication to all of it.""

WATCH | Arkansas ban leaves families with difficult choice

Arkansas ban on gender-affirming care for minors leaves families with difficult choice Duration 5:16 Some families of transgender kids in Arkansas fear they will be forced to leave the state if they want their children to keep receiving hormone treatments or puberty blockers after a ban on those treatments for minors.

Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Hussein Abdul-Latif said not all families will have the means to cross state borders for help.

That could mean an ""exacerbation of their own anxiety and depression … and increasing the potential for suicidal attempts or suicidal success, unfortunately,"" said Abdul-Latif, who provides hormone therapy and transition support for trans youth at Children's of Alabama hospital.

It could also mean trans youth and their families turn to ordering medication online ""that is not vetted and that is potentially not safe,"" he said.

Abdul-Latif hopes that legal challenges can stop the Alabama bill becoming law, but if that fails, he said he will face a tough decision around providing care that he thinks is important.

""I will have to do lots of soul-searching and decide eventually if I plan to break the law,"" he said.

Baay also thinks the anti-trans legislation is being deployed ""for votes and political clout.""

If they could speak to legislators, Baay said they'd want to share their story, because talking about transgender experiences has helped the people in their life understand.

""I find education is a large part of whether or not people support trans people a lot,"" they said.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/roger-stone-trump-election-jared-kushner,Roger Stone raged at ‘disgrace’ Trump over failure to overturn election – report,"Close Donald Trump ally Roger Stone raged at the former US president in the aftermath of the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election, according to a report from the Washington Post, telling a friend that Trump was a “disgrace” who would go to prison and adding: “He betrayed everybody.”

The Post said it had viewed 20 hours of footage of the political operative that had been shot for a forthcoming documentary. The footage, it said, showed Stone:

Meeting and corresponding with members of a far-right militia since indicted for seditious conspiracy over the Capitol riot on January 6.

Discussing a plan in which Trump would issue a blanket pardon to co-conspirators in the attempt to overturn the election, Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Jim Jordan among them.

Saying Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, should be “punished” in a way that would leave him “braindead”.

Suggesting violence against protesters for racial justice would be possible with the election out of the way.

“Once there’s no more election,” Stone reportedly said, “there’s no reason why we can’t mix it up. These people are going to get what they’ve been asking for.”

The plan for a blanket pardon was reportedly blocked by Pat Cipollone, Trump’s White House counsel. “Clearly, Cipollone fucked everybody,” the Post quoted Stone as telling a friend, before messaging another: “See you in prison.”

Trump had already commuted a three-year sentence handed to Stone for obstructing Congress during the Russia investigation.

The footage viewed by the Post was shot by Danish film-makers for a documentary, A Storm Foretold, to be released this year.

Stone, who has resisted cooperation with the House January 6 investigation, told the Post “any claim, assertion or implication that I knew about, was involved in or condoned the illegal acts at the Capitol on January 6” was “categorically false”.

Stone also said the paper employed “a clever blend of ‘guilt by association’, insinuations, half-truths, anonymous claims, falsehoods and out-of-context trick questions” and said the footage could be “deep fakes”.

Now 69, Stone – who was once a “dirty trickster” for Richard Nixon – has been close to Trump since the 1980s. In 2020 he was closely involved with the “Stop the Steal” movement to overturn Joe Biden’s victory, driven by the lie of widespread electoral fraud.

On 5 November, two days after election day and two days before Biden’s victory was called, the film-makers captured Stone talking to Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser Trump pardoned for lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation.

“Our slogan should be ‘count every legal ballot’,” Stone was quoted as saying. “Much better messaging. More positive.” In the White House briefing room that evening, the Post said, Trump said: “If you count the legal votes, I easily win.”

The Post detailed Stone’s activities leading up to 6 January, including staying at the Willard hotel, a “command centre” for Trump associates. Footage, the paper said, showed Stone with members of the Oath Keepers militia now charged with seditious conspiracy.

The film-makers also shot Stone as he attempted to broker presidential pardons for money, and as he attempted to secure access to Trump’s rally near the White House on 6 January, but failed.

As the Capitol riot began, the Post said, Stone was unavailable for a short period of time. He then told the film-makers: “I think it’s really bad for the movement. It hurts, it doesn’t help. I’m not sure what they thought they were going to achieve.”

But he also said: “When you can’t get a fair and honest judicial opinion, when you can’t get a fair, honest and transparent election, when your legislative process is constipated by fear and threat …”

The Post said Stone then “slightly misquot[ed] former president John F Kennedy”: “Those who make peaceful progress impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”

Stone returned to Florida and worked on his pardon plan. The Post said intended recipients included senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and representatives Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz. Spokesmen for Cruz and Jordan denied contacts with Stone.

On 20 January 2021, inauguration day, enraged by a pardon on fraud charges for Steve Bannon, a rival for Trump’s attentions, Stone reportedly said Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, was “going to get a beating. He needs to have a beating. And needs to be told, ‘This time we’re just beating you. Next time we’re killing you.’”

Urged to say he was joking, the Post said, Stone said: “No, it isn’t joking. Not joking. It’s not a joke.”

Stone also said Kushner should be “punished in the most brutal possible way” and would be “braindead when I get finished with him”.

Stone then turned to Trump, who he said deserved to be impeached and whose presidency had been the “greatest single mistake in American history”.

“A good, long sentence in prison will give him a chance to think about it, because the southern district is coming for him, and he did nothing,” Stone said, referring to prosecutors in New York investigating Trump’s business.

Stone also mocked Trump’s apparent plan to run again, saying: “Run again! You’ll get your fucking brains beat in.”

He told the film-makers: “Obviously if you use any of that, I’ll murder you.”",Q1

A Georgia sheriff asked for the public’s help Monday in finding the killers of an 8-year-old girl.

Arbrie Anthony of Augusta was killed in a weekend drive-by shooting on the 2000 block of Third Avenue.

Richmond County Sheriff Richard Roundtree said Monday that two suspects were seen driving a red-orange Jeep Compass TrailHawk with a large black stripe on the hood and a moon roof. But no arrests had been made and few other details were available.

The girl was shot as she stood outside an apartment complex Saturday night. Roundtree said investigators don’t believe the shooting was random but added that there is no reason to believe the little girl was the intended target.

""We are following up on every lead that comes in but I cannot and will not accept the fact that no one knows who these suspects are,"" Roundtree said. ""There are individuals in this community that knew why they were there, knew what they were there for and knew who they were after but yet they’ve failed to come forward with this information.""

Roundtree said there were horses for children to pet at the location of the shooting. One of the animals died after being hit by gunfire.

Friends and relatives of the dead girl held a vigil for her Sunday.

""She was out here, she was playing like she always does. She wanted to pet the horse, she saw horses, and she just got murdered senselessly,"" said Oluwatayo George, Arbrie’s cousin.

http://www.theasian.asia/archives/112144,Pakistan – A Country of Particular Concern!,"By Nasir Aijaz

AsiaN Representative

Islamabad: Certain gruesome incidents of murders and such other kind of persecution of religious minorities on the pretext of blasphemy allegations, having taken place with a sequence within last nine days, are perhaps enough to supplement the recommendation of United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) that Pakistan should be designated as ‘A Country of Particular Concern’.

The USCIRF, in its Annual Report, published in 2021, had recommended that Pakistan should be designated as “Country of Particular Concern” due to its worsening religious freedom conditions for Christians and other religious minorities.

Let’s ponder over the situation prevailing in Pakistan, in the light of USCIRF concerns, which stated that “Religious freedom conditions in Pakistan continued to worsen. The government systematically enforced blasphemy laws and failed to protect religious minorities from abuses by non-state actors. There was a sharp rise in targeted killings, blasphemy cases, forced conversions, and hate speech targeting religious minorities.”

On January 31, 2022, one William Siraj, a priest of a Church, was shot dead while another Patrick Naeem was injured after unidentified armed assailants opened fire on them in Peshawar, the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhaw province, bordering Afghanistan.

Just a couple of days later, on February 2, a Hindu businessman Satan Lal was shot dead by unknown assailants in Ghotki, a district notorious for persecution of Hindu community, in Sindh province of Pakistan. The incident took place at Daharki Town where a sacred Hindu Temple complex exists and at the time of his assassination, a religious congregation was in the progress. There are conflicting reports about this incident. Certain reports suggest that deceased Satan Lal was threatened many times by the Muslim extremists to leave for India, which he had refused, while according to other theory, the actual target was the chief Pundit of Temple Complex.

Earlier, on January 4, another Hindu businessman, Sunil Kumar, was shot dead by unidentified people in the same area of Ghotki district, bordering Punjab province.

While the peaceful protest by the Hindu community and the civil society against the murders was going on without any action taken so far by the government, a local court on February 7, 2022, awarded life imprisonment to a Hindu teacher Notan Lal, of same district, for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad, in a blasphemy case registered against him in September 2019. Notan Lal used to run a private school.

He was imprisoned since then after accusations from a student Muhammad Ihtisham, who later said he had lied. Following his ‘Lies’, the mob, led by extremist Mullahs, had vandalized the Nota’s school, five shops owned by Hindu community and Sacho Satram Das Temple. Reports suggest that this was a politically motivated act with Mian Mithoo, an influential Mullah of Ghotki district, known for forced conversions of Hindu girls, as its mastermind. It seems the court has convicted Notal Lal under pressure of the influential Mullah, who enjoys state support.

The court verdict came even after confessional statement of student Ihtisham on social media that ‘he accused the teacher of blasphemy because he had not memorized his lesson and the teacher had scolded him.’ He had urged “Sir Notan” for forgiveness in the social media post. The police had registered cases against more than 200 ‘unidentified persons’ involved in violence but no further action was taken.

Prof. Notan Lal was lodged in jail in Sukkur, another district, and the case against him was tried inside the prison instead of producing him in the court.

Similarly, on January 4 this year, a district judge in Punjab’s Rawalpindi city sentenced Zafar Bhatti, country’s longest-serving blasphemy accused, to death. Zaffar Bhatti, a Pastor, was already serving a life-long prison sentence when District Court Judge Sahibzada Naqeeb Shehzad increased the Christian man’s penalty for blasphemy against Islam to capital punishment.

Bhatti, 56, had been incarcerated in the Adiala Central Jail of Rawalpindi since July 2012 when police charged him with sending text messages deemed blasphemous against Islam. Bhatti had repeatedly denied the blasphemy charges leveled against him by the courts.

In Multan city of Punjab province, a Muslim professor was also sentenced to death after being convicted under blasphemy law on December 21, 2021. Prof. Junaid Hafeez, 33, was ‘found guilty’ of spreading anti-Islamic ideas. Hafeez was also fined half a million Pakistani rupees. Police had arrested Hafeez in 2013 for allegedly displaying blasphemous content while a visiting professor at Bahauddin Zakariya University in the city of Multan. He spent most of the time in solitary confinement. Amnesty International had appealed to the Pakistani authorities for unconditional release of the professor.

On December 3, 2021 a Sri Lankan factory manager was lynched, burned to death in Sialkot, Punjab.

A court in Lahore city of Punjab had assigned the death sentence under blasphemy law to Asif Pervaiz in September 2020, though Pervaiz’s status remained unclear.

Despite the Pakistan government’s lofty claims of complete religious freedom, the country’s Christian and Hindu communities continued to suffer discrimination, intolerance, and incidents of outright persecution during entire period of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) rule since August 2018.

The International Christian Concern (ICC) documented at least 25 incidents of persecution against Pakistan’s Christian population between January 1 and March 31, 2021. The documented incidents included false blasphemy accusations, abductions, forced conversions, forced marriages, physical violence, religiously motivated murders, and instances of intimidation. The incidents having taken place during later period are yet to be documented as in 2021 alone, there have been several examples of mob violence, targeted killings, and the desecration of graves and houses of worship.

Pakistan is overwhelmingly Muslim country but Christians and Hindus make up the largest minority groups, with each representing about 1.6% of the population.

Hindus are mostly settled in Sindh province while there are countless Christian villages in the Punjab heartland, while there is also a sizeable population in the deeply conservative north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, particularly in Peshawar city.

The majority of Pakistan’s Christians are descended from low-caste Hindus who converted during the British Raj – partly to escape the caste system. Christian communities remain among the poorest sections of society and often still do menial jobs. Entire villages in parts of Punjab are Christian and their inhabitants work as laborers and farmhands. However, there are sections of the Christian community that are well off, better educated and mainly settled in Karachi, Sindh. Most of Them came over from Goa, India during the British Raj however several Christian families shifted from Punjab being unsafe there.

It has been observed that Muslims, Christians and Hindus mostly co-exist amiably enough without frequent outbreaks of animosity but false accusations of blasphemy by extremist Islamists have often led to mob violence against religious minorities.

Here is a brief history of some unfortunate incidents:

An attack on a church in Quetta in December 2017 killed nine people and injured 57; a suicide attack targeting Christians celebrating Easter at a Lahore playground in March 2016 left 70 dead and more than 340 wounded; two bomb blasts at churches in Lahore in March 2015 killed 14 and hurt more than 70 people; a twin suicide bomb attack at a Peshawar church in 2013 left around 80 dead; in 2009, nearly 40 houses and a church were burnt by a mob in Gojra town in Punjab, with eight people burnt alive; in 2005, hundreds fled their homes in Faisalabad as churches and Christian schools were set on fire by a mob, after a resident was blamed for burning pages of the Holy Quran.

Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have also been convicted of “desecrating the Holy Quran” or “blaspheming against the Prophet Muhammad”, although experts say most accusations are fueled by personal disputes.

While most were handed death sentences by lower courts, those sentences were often set aside by higher courts due to lack of evidence or because the complainants were found to be targeting the community for economic benefits.

In 2012, a Christian girl, Rimsha Masih, became the first non-Muslim to be acquitted in a blasphemy case when it was discovered she had been framed by a local Muslim cleric.

Perhaps the best-known example is that of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman from a Punjab village who in 2010 got into an altercation with some Muslim women and was later accused by them of having blasphemed.

Salman Taseer, the then governor of Punjab who stated that Pakistan’s strict blasphemy law had been abused in the case, was later murdered by his Islamist bodyguard, Mumtaz Qadri.

Qadri was found guilty and executed in February 2016, prompting mass protests.

https://ultimateclassicrock.com/scorpions-survived-grunge/,Scorpions Survived Grunge By Not Fighting It,"Rudolf Schenker said Scorpions survived the grunge era by simply not fighting the musical revolution.

While many older bands struggled as tastes changed in the early ‘90s, the German group simply concentrated on places where they were still welcomed.

“When grunge and alternative blew up we were playing over in Asia, places like Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia where we still played in huge stadiums,” Schenker told Metal Hammer in a new interview. “Why fight grunge in Europe and America when we could play huge shows in Russia, Taiwan and so on?” He said of their approach: “It was a new generation of Germans coming into Russia not with tanks, but with guitars, bringing love and peace.”

He added: “There’s an interview with Metallica and I don’t remember if it was James [Hetfield] or Kirk [Hammett] who was asked how many countries they played; and either James or Kirk said, ‘Not as many as Scorpions!’ We had no fear! It paid off too — we sold more albums in Thailand than Michael Jackson; something like 20 times platinum.”

Describing the band’s five-decade run as “an unbelievable journey,” the guitarist admitted: “Sometimes I’ll think about it and tears will run down my face because I’m so impressed with what we’ve learned and lived through. We were the second-highest selling artist in the world behind Peter Frampton at one point; that was an amazing thing.”

Meanwhile, Scorpions have released “Seventh Son” from their new album Rock Believer, which arrives Feb. 25. You can hear the song below.

Robert Tyrone Hayes, 39, had been convicted of fatally shooting Laquetta Gunther, 45, Julie Green, 34, and Iwana Patton, 35, in a spree of separate incidents from December 2005 to February 2006 in Daytona Beach, Florida. He faces a pending case for allegedly strangling Rachel Elizabeth Bey, 32, who was found dead in Palm Beach County in 2016.

Prosecutors sought the death penalty. After a three-day sentencing hearing, a 12-member jury could not reach a unanimous decision as to whether or not the defendant should, indeed, be put to death by the state. So, a judge sentenced Hayes to three back-to-back life sentences, according to a press release from the office of State Attorney R.J. Larizza.

“While the Death Penalty was not imposed, Hayes will no longer prey on the unsuspecting and vulnerable – he will die in our State Prison System,” Larizza said in a statement. “There is Justice in that.”

Prosecutors called the murders each cold and premeditated. Hayes purchased a gun shortly before killing Gunther, who was found dead in a kneeling position between two buildings on Dec. 26, 2005. He had more than two weeks to reflect before killing Green, who was found dead on Jan. 14, 2006, in a ditch near a construction site. It was more than a month later that he murdered Patton, who was found on Feb. 24, 2006.

All three women were sex workers, and prosecutor Jason Lewis asserted in closing arguments of the penalty phase that Hayes targeted them because he wanted someone who would willingly join him in a desolate location.

In opening statements, prosecutor Andrew Urbanak emphasized the similarities between all three murders: each of the women was naked, they had no ID, and there was no struggle. The prosecution maintained this showed the killings were premeditated.

Gunther’s eldest daughter Guyette Luster said she and her siblings lost out on their chance to grow old with their mother.

Green’s sister Rhonda Iwanski told the court that part of her died with Julie. The murder occurred when another sister of theirs had terminal cancer.

Dr. Anisa Farris, Patton’s niece, read statements on behalf of the family. Patton’s sister described her as caring and someone who kept the peace. A nephew said Patton left an impression because of her smiles.

Attorney Chris Anderson told jurors the defense accepted the guilty verdict. He argued that evidence showed the killings were done in a frenzy, not with premeditation. For example, Hayes, a criminology major, did not take the time to use a condom to prevent leaving behind DNA.

Anderson said in opening statements that nothing he said was meant to diminish the value of human life, but he maintained that there enough mitigation that jurors should recommend life without parole instead of death. Hayes was raised without a father because his dad was murdered. He was a gifted student as a young man, but experienced abuse, the defense said.

Loved ones going back to childhood and college testified that Hayes was supportive and a good friend. The defense even highlighted an incident in which he stayed to make sure a woman was safe when a stranger tried to beat down her door. They maintained he behaved appropriately with women during ordinary circumstances.

The prosecution dismissed all of that. These murders were three independent decisions, and showed the killer’s true character. The court heard Hayes was a good cook and father, but none of this overrides killing and killing and killing, Anderson said.

The prosecution asked defense witnesses under cross-examination if Hayes was a good student, smart, or whether he displayed signs of mental illness or impulsive behavior. In other words, they wanted to suggest he planned these murders instead of acting impulsively.

Hayes friend Latisha Cornelius said Hayes was always a good friend to her. The news of these murders came to her as a shock. It was out of character for him, and not anyone she knew, she said.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's 'barbaric tactics' on Tuesday and insisted that energy sanctions are still 'on the table' if Moscow continues its brutal invasion of Ukraine.

Hours before President Joe Biden's State of the Union address at the US Capitol, Psaki defended his response to Putin's attack in an interview on Fox News.

She would not say the US was prepared to go as far as calling Putin a war criminal but said the administration was 'looking closely' at reports of devastating Russian attacks killing civilians in Ukraine.

Meanwhile Republican calls mount for the president to take action to increase domestic oil and gas production as a way to counter Russian influence on the global economy.

Late last week Russia's autocratic leader ordered an attack on neighboring Ukraine and disparaged its democratically-elected government as 'Nazis' committing 'genocide.' Since then Kyiv has put up an impressive resistance as the Kremlin's land, air and sea assault inches closer to the nation's capital.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Russia's Monday attack on the city of Kharkiv a 'war crime' and 'state terrorism of the Russian Federation' in a video message recorded Tuesday. Zelensky said Ukraine's second-largest city had 'dozens of victims' after an attack on its Freedom Square.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki defended President Joe Biden's measures against Russia's invasion of Ukraine hours before the State of the Union

The civilian attack, which reportedly killed three children, occurred against the backdrop of attempted peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.

More recently, Ukrainian officials claim an attack on Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon Eastern time hit a Holocaust memorial.

Asked whether the Biden administration shared the view Putin is a war criminal, Psaki said officials have seen a range of reports 'that are horrifying about the use of barbaric tactics whether cluster bombs or other tactics that we've seen that could be classified as a war crime.'

'I don't have any new classification for you from here but we are certainly engaged closely with our partners around the world, the president is and national security team is and we'll be closely watching and assessing that question,' she said.

International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan announced the Hague would open an investigation into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine on Monday.

Psaki on Tuesday didn't say whether Biden would get the State Department to open its own war crimes probe.

'Again, this is something we would need confirmation of, we would need to assess. Classification of a war crime is obviously a serious -- a serious decision to be made. It goes through lawyers as you noted,' Psaki explained.

'And we would also be working closely with the international community. So I don't have an update on that at this point in time, but there's no question ... that we're seeing barbaric tactics start to be used. That is horrifying, that is troubling and we will certainly be looking closely at it.'

The international community, including the United States, has buried Russia under a mountain of condemnation since the invasion began. A mass walkout of more than 100 diplomats from 40 nations occurred Tuesday during a United Nations speech by Kremlin Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

The West has also responded to Putin with a slew of historic economic sanctions, many never levied on an economy the size of Russia's. They include financial blockades on the country's largest banks, central financial institutions, a removal from the SWIFT global banking system and individual sanctions targeting Kremlin officials including Putin himself.

However the sanctions against Russian institutions and individuals have largely avoided targeting its oil and gas industry specifically.

Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil after Saudi Arabia, and is the largest producer of natural gas in the world. The European Union currently relies on Russia for 40 percent of its natural gas. About 60 percent of Russia's oil exports go to Europe.

'I would say the president shares the concern about the impact on gas prices and energy prices for the American people. That's why a range of options remain on the table,' Psaki said Tuesday.

Hours later the US and its 30 fellow International Energy Agency members agreed to release 60 million barrels from their oil reserves to mitigate sky-high prices around the globe.

Kansas Senator Roger Marshall urged Biden to go a step further, introducing legislation on Tuesday that would ban the US from purchasing Russian oil.

'First and foremost, President Biden needs to restart America’s energy production and quit financing Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine by continuing to purchase crude oil from Russia,' Marshall said in a statement.

'Under the previous Administration, our nation was energy independent but President Biden reversed course and turned hostile nations like Russia into America’s gas station.'

Florida Senator Rick Scott, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called on Biden to 'immediately roll-back its failed Green New Deal policies, take action to boost U.S. energy production and independence, and stop the purchase of, oil and other energy resources from Russia.'

Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas demanded that Biden reopen the stalled Keystone XL pipeline, which the president shut down last year over environmental concerns.

'How about we impose those sanctions, but we lift all those restrictions on the production of American oil and gas, so we can start drilling on federal lands again and putting out new leases,' Cotton said last week.

'So we can re-open the Keystone Pipeline, which would bring more oil into America every day from Canada than we import every day from Russia.'

But the Biden administration has little faith such policies would help, Psaki told Fox on Tuesday.

'This Keystone pipeline -- it would take years for that to have an impact on prices. Obviously there are a range of reasons why the president opposes it but it wasn't functioning, isn't functioning. It would take years,' the press secretary said.

'So yes, we all want to take steps to address any raise in gas prices that impacts the American people, but we should be very clear about what policies will help and what policies will not help. And over time we absolutely need to reduce our dependence and something you are seeing European countries take steps to do as well.'",Q1

Melton, a native of Waverly, Tennessee, was assigned to the 20th Security Forces Squadron, which is responsible for the safety at Shaw Air Force Base, located about 35 miles east of Columbia, South Carolina.

He was deployed in Niger with the 768th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron, Defense officials said.

But Garza is getting pushback from the Greater Austin Crime Commission, who is questioning some of the evidence presented to the grand jury that led to the indictments.

Garza’s campaign for DA in 2020 was heavily funded by organizations connected with George Soros, which have also invested in DA campaigns in Los Angeles, San Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago, and elsewhere.

In a letter to members, the GACC called on Garza to “step aside.”

There are legitimate questions about what evidence was presented to the grand jury. To ensure public confidence in the process, the district attorney should step aside and ask the court to appoint a special prosecutor for these cases. At a news conference last Thursday, Chief Joseph Chacon said, “I am not aware of any conduct that, given the circumstances that officers were working in, that would rise to the level of a criminal violation by these officers.” City Manager Spencer Cronk said criminal indictments of these officers are not the “correct outcome.”

The dilemma faced by Austin police officers during those days of violent protest was also faced by cops in many other cities. What can a policeman do when those deliberately fomenting violence mix in with those who are demonstrating peacefully?

Statements by some elected officials and media coverage ignore much of what happened nearly two years ago. Mayor Steve Adler said, “No one should be injured merely exercising their constitutional rights.” Undoubtedly true, but the mayor doesn’t mention that in addition to peaceful protesters, police were faced with rioters assaulting them, attempting to breach headquarters, and blocking an interstate highway. Rioters attacked officers with asphyxiate- and paint-filled balloons, boards, frozen water bottles, rocks, smoke grenades, and other objects. As far as we know, the tactics used by the officers were within department policy and state law.

Those who sympathize with the protesters expect cops to be superhuman and be able to differentiate between those who assaulted police as a political tactic and those caught in the middle of melees.

In Garza’s case, he has had his thumb on the scale weighted toward the violent rioters and against the police since the beginning of his term.

Since taking office last January, District Attorney José Garza’s actions have caused concern, such as refusing to take some felony cases to trial. The district attorney’s office has lost at least nineteen prosecutors. Some who left cite dysfunction and questionable directives. Garza and his first assistant district attorney have made prejudicial statements about prosecuting police officers, such as vowing to take all allegations of excessive force to the grand jury regardless of the evidence. Garza’s office withheld evidence that would benefit a police officer in a case involving expert testimony about the justified use of force.

Here are some examples from the latest potpourri of violent crimes in the city:

To combat crime, Mayor Eric Adams has been rolling out the NYPD's new anti-gun teams over the past two weeks. And now the NYPD has announced a return to cracking down on quality-of-life crimes.

""These are the things that work. It's about deterrents,"" Joe Giacalone, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and retired police sergeant, told Fox 5 News. ""When people know that they can get a summons, they can get arrested, they tend not to do these things.""

The NYPD said it is responding to the communities' complaints about open drug selling, public drinking, dice games, and public urination, which the department said can lead to more serious crimes.

On Monday, the mayor called on district attorneys to start prosecuting subway turnstile jumpers .

""They need to — it's a crime,"" Adams said. ""It's a crime.""

But Legal Aid Society attorney Jennvine Wong said, ""A long-term solution to public urination is more public bathrooms — not more police officers.""

The Legal Aid Society said this is a return to so-called broken-windows policing enacted under then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s.

""Broken-windows policing — it's been long discredited for furthering mistrust between the police and communities,"" Wong said.

Statement by the Police Commissioner

""As I stated on my first day as Commissioner, after visiting an officer who was shot two hours and thirty-nine minutes into the New Year, there are too many people carrying illegal guns and too many people willing to use them. That has to change. Now. To be clear, this is NOT a return to Stop, Question, and Frisk — nor is it 'policing for numbers.' This enforcement will be responsive to community complaints and concerns, and will address the violent crime patterns officers and detectives are confronting. This is precision-policing aimed at reducing violence in the neighborhoods seeing disproportionate numbers of shootings — and it is what the public is demanding."" —Commissioner Keechant Sewell

A high-profile nun is suing the District of Columbia over its vaccine mandate for healthcare workers, saying the requirement would force her to violate sincerely held religious beliefs.

Sister Dierdre “Dede” Byrne, a pro-life Catholic nun and practicing physician who works for a ministry providing free medical services to the poor, filed a lawsuit against the city, Mayor Muriel Bowser and D.C. Health Department Director LaQuandra Nesbitt for not granting a religious exemption from the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.

The conservative law firm Thomas More Society is representing Byrne in the litigation filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Wednesday.

“All three COVID-19 vaccines approved in the United States have been tested, developed, or produced with cell lines derived from abortions, something to which Sister Dierdre has deep and sincere religious opposition,” Thomas More Society Special Counsel Christopher Ferrara said in a statement.

The complaint contends it’s not necessary for Byrne to receive the coronavirus vaccine because she has contracted coronavirus and developed natural immunity, as confirmed by T-cell testing.

They believe that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution “protect Sister Dierdre’s fundamental right to the free exercise of her religion.”

Ferrara said the complaint seeks to “prevent a senseless bar on the practice of medicine by a religious sister who has devoted her career in the District of Columbia to healing the sick who cannot afford quality medical care.”

Byrne first submitted a request for a religious exemption from the vaccine mandate nearly six months ago, shortly after the district rolled out the vaccination requirement for healthcare workers as an emergency rule.

During that time, Byrne practiced medicine without vaccination and without objection from any hospitals or clinics where she served.

The D.C. Department of Health rejected Byrne’s request in an unsigned letter sent via email on Feb. 26, informing her that “You must immediately fulfill the requirement to receive at least one (1) dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (i.e., Moderna or Pfizer) or the single dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and upload that information … to the D.C. Health Vaccine Portal.”

The letter, included as an exhibit in Byrne’s complaint, stressed that failure to do so could “prohibit you from renewing your license or result in disciplinary action including revocation or suspension of your license, registration or certificate.”

In a video, Ferrara said that those who need Byrne’s medical services would be “deprived of those services” unless an injunction is granted.

The lawyer maintained that judicial relief is urgent because “that order denying her religious exemption request will become final on March 18.”

Byrne has spoken publicly about her opposition to abortion multiple times in the past year and a half. Speaking at the 2020 Republican National Convention, she described the unborn as “the largest marginalized group in the world.” She characterized the Democratic presidential ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as “the most anti-life presidential ticket ever.”

Addressing a conference hosted by the pro-life group Heartbeat International last year, Byrne condemned abortion as “the greatest inhumanity.” She stressed the importance of praying for “politicians who are wanting to make the abortion pill over the counter so people will be able to take it like bubble gum or Tylenol.” According to Byrne, “their soul is in a mortal state.”

The lawsuit comes after Washington, D.C. relaxed many of its coronavirus restrictions and mandates, including the requirement that those seeking entry into most businesses in the district provide proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test and the mask mandate for school students.

A Feb. 14 document highlighting adjustments to the “Mitigation Measures for COVID-19,” including removing the vaccine mandate for entry into private businesses, indicated that the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers would remain in effect.

D.C. and its top public officials are also facing a lawsuit filed on behalf of parents with children attending D.C. Catholic schools seeking “nominal damages” for the harms caused to their children by the city’s school mask mandate that was lifted this week.



There has been much litigation in the last year surrounding vaccine mandates nationwide. Many — including healthcare workers and military service members — have sued after being denied religious exemptions to vaccine mandates.



There was much debate in Catholic circles over the morality of COVID-19 vaccines.

As some military service members sued for exemptions to the Department of Defense’s vaccine mandate, the Roman Catholic Archbishop for the Military Services Timothy P. Broglio said last year that members of the Armed Forces should be exempt if the vaccine goes against “the sanctity of his or her conscience.”

“The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were tested using an abortion-derived cell line. That type of a link has been for centuries considered remote material cooperation with evil and is never sinful,” Broglio wrote.

“The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was developed, tested, and is produced, with abortion-derived cell lines. That vaccine is, therefore, more problematic. If it were the only vaccine available, it would be morally permissible.”

In December 2020, the Catholic Church’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a statement saying it was “morally acceptable” for Catholics to take the COVID-19 vaccine.

Texas megachurch Pastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas argued last year that “there is no credible religious argument against the vaccines.”

“Christians who are troubled by the use of a fetal cell line for the testing of the vaccines would also have to abstain from the use of Tylenol, Pepto Bismol, Ibuprofen, and other products that used the same cell line if they are sincere in their objection,” Jeffress said in an interview with The Associated Press.",Q1

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/historically-speaking-execution-silver-street-201350031.html,Historically Speaking: An execution on Silver Street in Dover in 1846; inmates who escaped,"The last time we saw Andrew Howard he was in his cell at the Silver Street jail awaiting a retrial on the charge of murdering Phoebe Hanson. That second trial took place in 1845 and this time it lasted a week. Defense attorney Daniel Christie made an extended final argument, but on this occasion the jury took little time in returning a verdict of guilty in the first degree.

The execution was set for Nov. 12. The gallows were in place in the front yard of the jail building. A crowd, estimated to be several thousand, was in attendance to witness the event. With minutes remaining, a representative from the Governor's office appeared with an order, not of a pardon, but merely a postponement. And so on July 8, 1846, the scene was repeated, but this time the gallows were erected to the rear of the jail and a type of barricade erected in a limited attempt to shield the hanging from public view. It was reported that spectators were standing atop fences surrounding the property and on the roofs of neighboring barns. After a strong objection from the assembled crowd - again in the range of several thousand - the barrier was removed and the execution went forward.

A portion of the jail property was later traversed by the rail line constructed for the Portsmouth and Dover Railroad, now the location of the Dover Community Trail. The balance was sold in 1888, upon the construction of a new jail, and a part of the property became the site of the home of Philip and Marguerite Brown, he the son of Elisha Brown, she the daughter of I.B. Williams, one of Dover's more attractive residences, even to today.

The Silver Street jail closed because a new jail had been constructed on land across the river from what was the southeasterly end of Washington Street (with any luck soon to be Dover's new Waterfront Development). The building was of a unique design with the cells built on a kind of revolving platform with a manually controlled apparatus that could align an individual cell to provide limited access to the common areas of the jail, thus guaranteeing more control and improving the security to the staff during the distribution of meals or the movement of any prisoner for visitations or for court appearances.

As with the previous buildings, the jailer's home, a brick structure that remains to this day, was attached to the main jail. You might think that such a unique system (though there were a number of jails with a similar design at different locations around the country) would be escape-proof, but such was not the case.

The prisoner's name was McArthur, and he was complaining of leg pains. He was moved from his cell to an area designated for women prisoners which offered more comfortable quarters, but perhaps less security. One day, the daughter of the jailer, who at that time was Frank Libbey, brought a meal to McArthur's location only to find him missing. Speculation was that the prisoner exited through a window, presumably with outside help, following which any investigation and pursuit was minimal, allegedly due to McArthur's local ""fraternal"" connections. In any event, the facts surrounding his disappearance were never pinned down and McArthur was long gone.

And there were others. On Jan. 22, 1906, Elmo and Rosie Grenier appeared in Dover District Court. Elmo was charged with concealing an escaped prisoner, one John Rogers. Rosie was charged with providing a steel saw, presumably used by Rogers to gain his freedom. On the following Friday, with a courtroom ""packed to capacity,"" both Greniers waived a hearing and were bound over to Superior Court with bail set at $1,000 each (about $30,000 in today's money). Rogers was later apprehended and within months became a resident of the State Prison in Concord.

On June 17 of that same year, Michael Cummings was serving time for burglary of a home in Rochester. He was considered a ""trusty,"" serving as a cook for the other inmates. He made his way through the guard room which connected with the jailer's attached residence and made his way to the outside through the front entrance, at which time, as reported by the local reporter, ""he quickly made himself scarce around the premises.""

At the time, Cummings had four days left on his original sentence, though he might have owed up to two months more if not able to pay for the court costs and fees associated with his conviction.

It was duly noted that Cummings had been the fifth prisoner to escape since January. One was William Hanna, who was subsequently arrested in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Another was a Captain Vallie, by June being held in Manchester ""after running at large for a couple of months."" The fifth man was one Manuel Rogers, who was being held as a material witness. However, he managed to escape. He voluntarily returned to the facility ""after one night's absence"".

Several familiar names appear in connection with the above. The Judge in the Grenier matter was George Seward Frost; the prosecutor was County Attorney Dwight Hall. Among those who aided in the pursuit of Michael Cummings were Dover Police Officer Walter Sterling--- later the shooting victim of his son-in-law, John Dame (with Frost and Hall again as Judge and Prosecutor) and Deputy Sheriff Bert Wentworth, who later served as Clerk of the District Court.

He said that currently there is “no relationship” between the two countries and both are in a stalemate.

“We can build a relationship with India but it has to start from them going back to that step they took on August 5, 2019,” Khan said. “They have to restore the status of Kashmir because that’s a violation of international law.”

The Indian government had abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to the former state, on August 5, 2019. The erstwhile state was split into the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Khan said that negotiating with India at this point would lead to “betrayal of the people of Kashmir”, who had been given a “guarantee by the international community at the United Nations Security Council to decide their destiny through a plebiscite”.

The prime minister added that Pakistan was dealing with an “irrational government” in India whose ideologies he alleged are based on hatred towards Muslims and minorities.

Khan also claimed that the Pulwama attack of February 14, 2019, was carried out by “a young Kashmiri boy”, but India has blamed Pakistan for it. The National Investigation Agency has named Pakistani terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and 18 others in the chargesheet.

As many as 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed in the attack. In retaliation, India on February 26, 2019, carried out air strikes on a camp of terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pakistan’s Balakot area.

A day after the cross-border strike, India and Pakistan engaged in aerial skirmishes. On February 27, the Pakistani military claimed it had shot down two Indian Air Force jets – one had crashed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the other fell in Jammu and Kashmir.

India has maintained that Pakistan shot down one MiG-21 aircraft, while the Indian Air Force shot down a Pakistani F-16 jet during the dogfight. Pakistan had also managed to capture IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.

Khan during Tuesday’s interview with Le Figaro said that the Pulwama attack had led to hostilities between the two nations and that Varthaman was returned to India as Pakistan “did not want any escalation”.",Q1

https://www.nancyonnorwalk.com/as-ct-seeks-to-desegregate-schools-suburban-districts-are-slow-to-help/,"As CT seeks to desegregate schools, suburban districts are slow to help","Five-year-old Darien kindergarten student Vivi Witthuhn holds her favorite protest sign. Her mother expressed concerns about her daughter having to explain to classmates why her mother is Black. (Tyler Russell, Connecticut Public)

Amid the protestors chanting “change your vote” outside the school board offices in the wealthy shoreline town of Darien stood 5-year-old Vivi Witthuhn holding a sign asking officials to be kind — and reverse course and allow a few kindergarten students from the overcrowded urban district next door into her school.

Talking with a slight lisp after one her front teeth fell out that morning, this kindergarten student reads what’s on her sign.

“Everybody pay attention. Please be nice and not mean.”

This rejection from a wealthy suburban community to open its borders even slightly is a trend in Connecticut — which research shows is one of the most economically and racially segregated states in the country.

This year, it was Darien’s school board rejecting a plan that would have enrolled 16 Norwalk kindergarteners throughout its elementary schools. The wealthy suburban districts surrounding Danbury decided earlier this year they wouldn’t be opening their classrooms, either.

In 2017, when more than 1,000 Puerto Rican children showed up in Waterbury after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island, neighboring suburban districts ignored the pleas for help from city officials. They were asking suburban school leaders to use their empty classrooms because there was no room in the city’s schools.

“I was really disappointed with either the lack of response or no response,” said state Rep. Geraldo Reyes, who chairs the General Assembly’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. “This spoke volumes of how some of the suburbs perceive our children from Waterbury.”

This rejection from the suburbs to open their doors — either to school busing programs or to allow more affordable housing to be built in their communities — has been going on for generations.

In 1989, the year a coalition of civil rights leaders sued the state over the segregation that was thriving in the Hartford region, nearly 1,500 city children were enrolled in nearby, well-resourced suburban schools through a program called Project Concern.

Click photo to use interactive feature.

Three decades later — and after the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled children “suffer daily” from the inequities caused by the racial and economic isolation — the program, now called Open Choice, has only grown by about 700 Hartford students.

“It tells me it’s not working,” said John Brittain, one of the original attorneys involved in the Hartford Sheff vs. O’Neill desegregation lawsuit. “It tells me there’s a need to increase [the] degree of diversity.”

Brittain grew up in Norwalk, the town whose students Darien and other nearby suburbs seem reluctant to open their doors to.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Open Choice was supposed to be a tool that suburban districts could use to help integrate their schools instead of the state redrawing school district boundaries, as the Supreme Court pointed to as the culprit of segregation in the Sheff case.

But year after year, millions that the state has set aside to pay for Open Choice go unspent when suburban districts decline to offer more seats, despite declining enrollment in their towns. In New Haven and Bridgeport, fewer than 300 kids from each city land a spot in Open Choice.

The wait lists are long.

Martha Stone, one of the attorneys in the Sheff case, homed in on this at the press conference in January announcing the historic agreement with the state that aims to expand the program by 450 Hartford kids over the next seven years.

“Just last year, there were 896 Hartford kids that wanted to go to the suburban schools in a non-entry grade and never had that opportunity because there were no suburban districts that would allow them to have educational opportunities in their district,” she said. “And that’s the issue of the suburban districts being willing to have some kind of a real self-examination. We’ve all had issues and demonstrations after George Floyd, but we still haven’t had districts come forward and say ‘Yes, we want to be part of the solution. To be able to open up our doors to all students.’”

Gov. Ned Lamont also promised in that agreement that every Black and Latinx student from Hartford who wants a seat in a high-quality integrated school would be offered one.

“This is an opportunity for Connecticut to get it right,” he said during the press conference. “This is a way that we’re going to make sure that no kid is left behind, regardless of race, color, or creed. This is a way to make sure they have choice. Parents have choice. Kids have choice. They can go to the school of their choice. Nobody’s going to be kept out.”

Governor embraces the carrot, not the stick to integrate

The Democratic governor was the driving force behind the Open Choice program becoming an option in Norwalk and Danbury instead of just the Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport regions as it has been.

He first proposed the expansion one year ago in his budget address before the General Assembly.

“With many of our urban schools crowded and their suburban schools with extra capacity, my budget proposes an expansion of the Open Choice program beginning in Norwalk and Danbury. So these kids and those in surrounding communities can go to school in a more diverse environment with greater opportunity,” he said.

But despite the General Assembly providing more than $1 million to roll this out, the program will not be launching in the Danbury area next year as originally planned. Shortly before Darien voted down the plan to enroll 16 kindergarten students from Norwalk, the school board heard from Charles Dumais, the executive director of the organization that has been tasked with running the Open Choice program in those parts of the state.

“At this point, there’s not a critical mass that would put us in a position where providing transportation would be reasonable at this point. So we’re going to push out Danbury one more year,” he said.

This approach of Lamont offering districts financial incentives to step up followed a wave of backlash he received to a previous proposal of his that would have penalized tiny school districts whose officials wouldn’t consider regionalizing some administrative-level positions.

Several residents from Darien were the leading voices behind that movement — branded “Hands off our Schools.” They organized dozens of protests around the state and at the Capitol to defeat the plan.

Darien School Board member Tara Ochman waited hours to testify at the state Capitol complex against that proposal.

“I went up to Hartford,” she said. “I testified against regionalization. I made the argument that we could do it better ourselves if you let us. I think we’re going to have to answer the state if we turn down choice programs.”

After voting in favor of allowing roughly one Norwalk student in each of the district’s kindergarten classrooms, she began receiving hate mail. One accuses her of “turning Darien into the woke slums.”

State Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff has also been receiving emails from Darien residents, where just 7% of the students are Black or Latinx compared to 67% in Norwalk, where he lives. One of those emails told him, “You can keep your troubled school system and troubled minority students in your own troubled town … full of poor schools and welfare recipients.”

Duff attended the rally, and said during an interview after that, ”I think in some ways that email represents some of the reasons why people voted ‘No.’ Part of this vote, I think, is rooted in that email.”

The reasons to say ‘no’…

Opponents cite a host of reasons why Darien schools can’t accept these students: Classrooms don’t have the space; enrollment is projected to increase as more housing is built in town and as families relocate from New York City during the pandemic.

Kindergarten enrollment in the district has dropped by 21% since 2007, enrollment has not increased during the pandemic, and projections do not forecast an uptick in enrollment.

John Sini voted against the plan. Until recently, he was the chairman of Darien’s Planning & Zoning Commission, which determines what type of housing gets built in town.

“There is some uncertainty around the class number of sections. I think we are going back to normal, but I think we actually have to focus on our kids,” he said before the vote. “I know the three apartment complexes are coming along, and a few others, I’m confident that they’re developed so it’s going to mitigate the number of families in terms of how they’re developed and their sizes.”

Although the federal Fair Housing Act prohibits people with children from being discriminated against, many civil rights attorneys and housing advocates believe that some affluent suburban towns only allow one- or two-bedroom apartments to open to avoid erecting affordable housing options for families.

Nearly half of the 366 housing units that will soon open in Danbury are one bedroom and the remainder two bedrooms, a review of approved housing units by CT Public’s Accountability Project shows. Research shows few children move into such housing.

“Multifamily housing does not yield high numbers of children. The effect on the schools are de minimis,” Evonne Klein, the state’s former Housing Commissioner, said after the rally in Darien, which is where she lives.

There are also concerns about the fiscal cost to the town, despite the superintendent mapping out the finances and showing the districts would actually gain financially.

“It has potential to be a revenue generator run the right way — but it also has the potential to have some costs. I don’t think this is the year, and so I won’t be voting for it tonight,” said Jill McCammon, the vice chairperson of the local school board.

Wealthy towns’ rejection will cost the state millions

The rejection from Darien and other suburban districts will likely cost the state millions, since new schools will need to be built to help the overcrowded districts.

The governor is frustrated by this reality, but he’s not ready to force districts to participate.

“I was disappointed to see a couple of those communities say no to Open Choice. That means we have to go with new schools. That’s so we can decompress some of the classrooms. For example, in Danbury. You know me, I prefer incentives to mandates,” he said.

His administration surveyed school districts last fall to take an inventory of empty school buildings across the state for the state to potentially renovate and open.

Meanwhile, wealthy districts continue to receive construction money to build segregated schools.

Darien has received just over $11 million since 2006 from the state to help build two of the elementary schools that the superintendent wanted to enroll a few Norwalk students in. Connecticut taxpayers also spend at least $14 million a year paying for the pensions of retired Darien teachers.

(NEW YORK) — The deaths of two young aspiring rappers last week have reinvigorated the debate about drill music, a popular subgenre of rap, and its connection to violence.

Jayquan McKenley, an 18-year-old aspiring rapper from the Bronx known as CHII WVTTZ, was shot and killed Sunday morning while leaving a recording studio in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.

McKenley was shot in the chest, police said, and was transferred to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

His death came days after 22-year-old Tahjay Dobson, who is known as rapper Tdott Woo, was shot and killed Tuesday in front of his home in the neighborhood of Canarsie hours after signing a record deal.

Rising Brooklyn rapper TDott Woo fatally shot as gun violence plagues hip-hop community

An NYPD spokesman told ABC News on Thursday that no arrests have been made in either case and the investigations are ongoing. Major crime in New York City is up 38.5% from January 2021 to January 2022, according to NYPD statistics.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who shared McKenley’s story during a press conference Thursday, addressed the problem of gun violence in the drill community and the proliferation of guns in the city while speaking to reporters Friday.

Adams said he is set to meet with “some very top known rappers” to form a coalition of hip-hop artists dedicated to tackling the problem.

“We’re going to sit down and really bring in the rappers and show how this is impacting and is causing loss of lives of young people like them,” Adams said, adding that he will share the names of the artists and details about the meeting soon.

What is drill music?

McKenley and Dobson were both part of the Brooklyn drill music scene – a hip-hop subgenre that started in Chicago and was popularized by Chicago rappers like Chief Keef, Lil Durk,·Fredo Santana, King Louie, G Herbo, Lil Bibby and Lil Reese.

Jabari Evans, a professor of race and media who studies subgenres of urban youth, at the University of South Carolina, told ABC News that the “well-defined sound” of drill music is what makes it unique, and the genre is sonically known for “chanty choruses, dark scents and kind of warring 808 [drum beats].”

But the violence described in the lyrics and the genre’s origins in Chicago gang culture are what make it controversial.

Erik Nielson, co-author of the 2019 book “Rap on Trial: Race, Lyrics, and Guilt in America,” told ABC News that drill music’s “primary connection to violence is artistic and creative” and for drill artists, the music is “a way out of the the violent neighborhoods that they chronicle.”

According to Evans, drill rap emerged in the Southside of Chicago in the early 2010s as Chicago’s version of “gangster music” and was centered around “well-defined gang politics.”

“The meaning on the streets of Chicago was, if you were doing a ‘drill,’ that meant you were doing a crime,” he said.

But drill music “evolved” over the years, as it blew up around the world, Evans added, becoming popular in cities from NYC, to Los Angeles and countries like the United Kingdom and Uganda.

And despite the diversity of the lyrics and the artists, Evans said the genre still carries the same violent connotation in the media and for law enforcement.

‘His music was anything but hopeful’

Over the years, drill artists have been monitored and targeted by law enforcement, with some being banned from performing in their own hometowns. But artists have long argued that their music is a form of self-expression that chronicles the struggles of life on the streets.

Such was the case of McKenley, Mayor Adams said on Thursday, as he discussed problems in the city’s social services, criminal justice and school systems that leave young people vulnerable.

“There are thousands of Jayquans in our city right now,” Adams said. “Thousands of children experiencing homelessness and poverty, who need educational support, who are at high risk … we cannot let thousands of children lose their lives to violence and neglect.”

Adams said that once he learned about McKenley’s life, “a clear profile emerged of someone who needed help” because he struggled in school and at home. He was also arrested multiple times between 2018-2021, most recently for attempted murder.

Like other drill music artists, McKenley and Dobson built a following and released their music on social media.

McKenley’s Instagram account has more than 27,000 followers and Dobson has more than 94,000 followers.

“Like many young men, Jayquan was an aspiring rapper. ‘Aspiring’ is a word that means hope, but his music was anything but hopeful,” Adams said.

Asked if McKenley and Dobson’s killings could be related to gang violence, the police did not comment.

‘We can’t stereotype an entire group’

The Brooklyn drill music scene was brought into the mainstream by artists like Fivio Foreign and the late rapper Pop Smoke, who was one of the biggest stars to popularize Brooklyn drill before he was shot and killed on Feb. 19, 2020.

Hot 97’s DJ Drewski, whose legal name is Andrew Loffa, was an early supporter of Pop Smoke and the Brooklyn drill music scene. He said on Tuesday in a message posted to his Instagram Stories that while he will continue to play drill music, he will no longer play “diss/gang” music that is aimed at rival rappers.

“If ya dissing each other in the songs, don’t even send it to me!” he wrote. “We r losing too many young men and women to the streets!”

Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez told Fox5NY earlier this week that there have been “a number of shootings in Brooklyn recently that are directly related to drill.”

“These drill rap videos are causing young people to lose their lives. It’s not that the music is the cause of the violence, but it’s fueling the desire to retaliate,” he said.

Fivio Foreign, who was friends with TDott Woo, defended the genre in an interview with TMZ Tuesday, saying, “It’s not the music that’s killing people, it’s the music that’s helping n—– from the hood get out the hood.”

But Perry Williams, McKenley’s father, criticized the impact of drill music scene in an interview with Fox5NY, saying his son faced intense competition as an aspiring rapper.

“Our hip-hop is no long hip-hop anymore, and now, if you’re not doing drill, you’re not going to get no play,” Williams said.

Evans said that while “drill has produced real violence,” artists have a right to self-expression and each artist has unique motivations.

“We can’t stereotype an entire group based on the genre of music that they’ve chosen to participate in,” he said.

There’s a longstanding tradition of artists feuding through their music in hip-hop and it’s possible that it “spills over into the streets or in real life,” Nielson said.

But he added that drill music has become “a convenient boogeyman” for law enforcement – “a lazy, misinformed narrative” that ignores the “systemic causes of violence in these neighborhoods.”

Evans echoed Nielson, saying that “it’s easy to make drill a scapegoat,” but “in reality, the situations, the spaces, places, and problems that existed in certain communities existed far before drill.”

In sharing McKenley’s story, Adams addressed those systemic problems, including homelessness and poverty that left the teenager vulnerable.

“To Jayquan’s mother and father, I want you to say I’m sorry,” a tearful Adams said.

He added, “I’m sorry that your son was passed over for so long and taken from you too soon. I’m sorry we betrayed him, and so many others like him.”

The brother of a Pakistani Christian man granted bail last week after spending years in prison is pleading with Pope Francis and other international leaders to evacuate and grant his brother asylum in a Western country as concerns about his health and safety persist.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Pakistan granted bail for Nadeem Samson, a Catholic who has been imprisoned in Pakistan for four years on blasphemy charges. Samson’s brother, Shakeel Anjum, a United States citizen, reacted to the development in an interview with The Christian Post.

“[On the] one side, we are happy. But [on the] other side, we are very afraid,” he said, speaking on behalf of himself and another brother, who also lives in Pakistan.

Anjum cited the Jan. 3 death sentence of Zafar Bhatti, another Christian imprisoned under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, as a cause for concern.

While the Supreme Court of Pakistan granted Samson bail, the legal proceedings stemming from the blasphemy charges against him will continue at the district court level.

Anjum told CP that “trials are very dangerous” because “he has to … go to the court back and forth to attend the hearings.” He recalled a 2020 incident where a Muslim accused of blasphemy was “murdered right in the court,” fearing that his brother could end up facing the same fate.

“He was murdered right in the court,” Anjum said. “He was on bail and he got shot dead and somebody just killed him in the court.”

More recently, on Dec. 3, a Twitter account managed by Anjum devoted to securing his brother’s release retweeted a video of a Sri Lankan Hindu Factory manager who was “burned alive by #Muslims mob” for accused blasphemy. Anjum said these two incidents have left him and his brothers “really scared” and “really worried.”

In light of the concerns and the fact that “mob attacking is common in Pakistan,” Anjum delivered an appeal to the pope and Josep Borrell, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs.

“Both [of my] brothers actually should be evacuated immediately because this is very, very risky,” he said.

Anjum also fears for his brother, Michael, who has attended Samson’s court proceedings and visited him in jail. He believes that Michael’s association with Samson is enough to put his life in danger as well. Anjum called on the Canadian government to grant Samson asylum “to save his life.”

“I have no parents. I have two brothers … in Pakistan,” Anjum added. “They should be protected and they should be evacuated immediately from Pakistan.”

Anjum elaborated on the toll that four years in prison has taken on his brother. “My brother, for [the] last few months, he has [been] very sick,” he said. “We got the orders for his treatment. We got the court order for … his immediate treatment.”

Because the jail superintendent didn’t allow his brother “out of the jail for his treatment,” Anjum said Samson was in “severe pain.”

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom’s profile on Samson lists kidney stones as a health concern and indicates that he has faced torture while detained.

“Samson is reportedly living in inhumane conditions at the district jail in Lahore, where he has also been denied adequate medical care for treating kidney stones,” the congressionally-mandated religious freedom body said.

Anjum agreed with Samson’s lawyer that his bail was “historic.” Blasphemy charges in Pakistan can be punishable with life imprisonment and even the death penalty. However, the Pakistani government has never executed anyone for a blasphemy conviction.

Specifically, section 295-C of Pakistan’s penal code mandates that “whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy [Islamic] Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.”

As CP previously reported, Samson was arrested in November 2017 after the man he was leasing a house from told police that the Pakistani Catholic had posted blasphemous material on his Facebook account.

Anjum previously alleged that the man, Abdul Haq, created a fake Facebook account to smear his brother in an effort to avoid having to pay Samson the $4,000 owed to him as part of the lease agreement.

Anjum previously predicted that the Supreme Court of Pakistan would make a fair decision about Samson’s fate because they have bodyguards and are therefore not intimidated by the mob. By contrast, Anjum asserted, the trial court judges “do not have any security for themselves.”

“So they have only one option,” he maintained. “They have to allow the punishment.”

Anjum lamented that most blasphemy cases in Pakistan follow a familiar pattern, where after several years of litigation, the judges determine that the accusations of blasphemy are false.

“Their lives are ruined in trial,” Anjum said of those falsely accused of blasphemy. In the case of Samson, his accuser “never appeared in the trial court.”

False allegations of blasphemy are a common occurrence in Pakistan. Patrick Sookdeho of the Barnabas Fund, a Christian aid agency, elaborated on the indiscriminate and improper use of blasphemy laws in Pakistan at the first annual International Religious Freedom Summit that took place in Washington, D.C., last summer.

In a panel discussion featuring Asia Bibi, another Pakistani Christian imprisoned on blasphemy charges who since fled the country, Sookdeho informed attendees that Pakistan’s blasphemy law “has been used by those who are unhappy with Christians or [used against] a particular Christian as a weapon” to “settle scores.”

“In Pakistan today, there are at least five Christians on death row for blasphemy,” he proclaimed. “There are 20 Christians in prison on blasphemy charges. ... Since 1990, at least 15 Christians have been murdered because of blasphemy allegations, often before trial has begun.”

He stressed that the allegations of blasphemy and hostile treatment endured by Pakistani Christians “does not come from the government, per se, but rather from the institutions of society.”",Q1

Jake Reed, 27, who joined the force in 2017, died Friday and his organs were donated, police said.

'(Friday) evening Officer Jake Reed continued his service to others as his vital organs were escorted to the airport and flown across the country to give life to others,' the statement said.

Reed, 27, and Joplin police Cpl. Benjamin Cooper were fatally shot on Tuesday when they confronted 40-year-old Anthony Felix at a Joplin shopping area.

The officers were responding to a 'disturbance' at the mall but cops would not provide any additional details as to what led to the fatal encounter.

Cooper, 46, a 19-year veteran, died Tuesday at a hospital.

Authorities said Felix then fled in a stolen patrol car, which he eventually crashed.

A third Joplin officer, 53-year-old Rick Hirshey, saw Felix trying to steal another car and positioned his patrol car to stop him, Chief Sloan Rowland said.

Felix shot Hirshey through the windshield of his car, authorities said. Hirshey remains hospitalized.

Capt. William Davis, 36, shot and killed Felix shortly after Hirshey was shot.

Kim Jenkins, who lives near where the third officer and the suspect were shot, said she saw a man with a gun hiding behind a fence across the street from her home, The Joplin Globe reported.

She said the officer drove down the street and stopped in front of a van the suspect was hiding behind.

That's when the suspect fired at the officer, apparently shooting him through the windshield of his patrol car.

'I don´t think he even had time to get out when the guy started shooting,' Jenkins said.

Several other officers arrived and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who was hit by gunfire, she said.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting with the investigation, Lewis said.

The department announced that separate public visitations and funeral services for Cooper and Reed will be held at the Leggett and Platt Center on the Missouri Southern Campus.

A public visitation for Cooper will be Monday from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., with the funeral Tuesday at 1 p.m. Reed's visitation will be Thursday from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., with the funeral on Friday at 1 p.m.

Reed's former high school baseball coach mourned the 'tragic' loss.

https://it-online.co.za/2022/03/02/private-5g-networks-usher-in-new-wave-of-connectivity/,Private 5G networks usher in new wave of connectivity,"Kathy Gibson is at Mobile World Congress 2022 – Private 5G networks offer enterprises new opportunities to transform themselves, digitalise and find new ways to serve their customers.

This is the message from Tami Erwin, CEO of Verizon Business, who says private networks and private edge compute complement the networks that are commonly in use today.

“Private networks offer a big opportunity to dramatically transform absolutely everything about the business,” she says.

Erwin cites the example of a private network deployed by Associated British Ports, which was battling with revenue growth, supply chain and employee engagement.

They realised that WiFi was no longer working effectively for them as they wanted guaranteed cover, low latency, better speed and control.

“We implemented a private network for them and they were able to transform their work environment,” says Erwin. “Evidence of how well it worked is the fact that they now want to double what they have.”

She believes private networks will be the gateway to edge computing. “There is tremendous data being generated from all the connectivity and devices they have, and there are endless use cases for this data.

“The network has helped Associated British Ports to transform how they service their customers, how their employees engage, and how data is used.”

A private 5G network delivers more throughout than a 4G network, and offers additional benefits including higher speed, lower latency of as little as sub-10ms, and sensor densification of up to 1-million per square kilometre.

Workloads on the private network can also be seamlessly switched to the public network, Erwin points out.

“We believe that private networks, public edge compute and business application/solutions will be a huge revenue generator for Verizon.

“They allow us to deploy complex digital transformation roadmaps that we have built around managed services. Private networks offer customers complete security, guaranteed coverage and low latency.”

Verizon believes that private networking is a $30-billion addressable market in the US alone.

“This private and public edge compute and a business stack that transforms the way we work.”

It’s not just industrial companies that are experiencing the benefits, Erwin adds. BlackRock has deployed a private 5G network in its New York offices that has changed how it serves customers and partners, with the technology allowing them to be faster and more effective.

The ending of lockdowns associated with the Covid-19 pandemic has seen a return to work of many organisations – but this isn’t the only reason that 5G private networks have become more popular.

“Yes, companies expect people to start returning to work, but they are also looking to how they can deploy 21st century technologies like broadband, mobile and cloud – and private networks complement that,” Erwin says.

Private networks will usher in a shake-up in the industry in that the telco no longer expects to run the entire stack. “We are brighter and smarter, realising we can’t provide everything,” Erwin says. “But, also, the world is moving so much faster than ever, so companies are accelerating transformation and reimagining everything about their businesses.”

Masum Mir, vice-president and GM: cable, mobility and IoT at Cisco, stresses that the future of work cannot be exclusive, but must embrace both office and front-line workers wherever they are.

“Imagine if we could create a common playing field for office and front line workers,” he says. “When we think about private networks, we need to think about what will drive value.

“We believe future technologies need to bring people, things and space together.”

Mir believes that the current technologies like 5G will continue to be used by enterprises, but that 5G and private 5G will augment these systems that will allow organisations to digitalise quicker.

“This is an opportunity for service providers to create high-value managed services,” he says.

Cisco will augment existing access technologies with 5G for simple, in intuitive and trusted networks that offers much better cover for more and low-latency applications.

“They offer an opportunity for private and public networks to roam seamlessly, to bring simplicity to enterprises, and for service provider sto participate in the managed services journey.”

Jane Rygaard, head of dedicated wireless networking at Nokia, believes that the most rewarding use case for private 5G networks is currency in the industrial space.

“Industry 4.0 requires agility to address a changing world: we don’t get this unless we go digital.

“For industrial organisations that want to get to a different place, and realise the benefits, they have to become digital in a physical world.”

The new networks need to be resilient and agile, with sustainability that goes beyond energy-efficiency, Rygaard adds.

The first step is to gain a realtime digital view of the organisation’s physical assets, and then control these assets using digital connectivity.

There are huge opportunities: Rygaard says about 70% of industrial assets are yet to be connected.

“The key is reliable wireless, with these networks offering value including production, efficiencies and business processes. It is about being agile enough so that whatever change organisations encounter they have the right solutions in place.”",Q1
http://libcom.org/library/pinchpoint-target,Pinchpoint target,"Some people think the IWW should pour all of its resources into organizing in an industry which is particularly important to the economy, to maximize our impact on capitalism--I call this the “Pinchpoint Target” idea.

Pinchpoint Target is the idea that there's one key sector or a few key sectors of the economy where organized workers could shut down capitalism. This means workers in that sector or sectors have a certain level of objective power, at least potentially. For instance, if every dockworker in the United States went on strike the global economy would stop. Dockworker strikes stop an incredibly valuable amount of machinery and goods. Every minute of the strike costs the bosses of the world a great deal of money. This analysis is correct. It does not mean that the IWW should focus only organizing dockworkers.

The problem with Pinchpoint Target is that it takes a correct objective analysis of the economy--some sectors are more important to the global economy than others--and argues that the analysis should dictate organizational strategy. The mistake is that Pinchpoint Target says that we'll organize that key sector or sectors and then be able to end capitalism. That is, the idea is that workers in that sectors or sectors will lead the charge for everyone else.

There are at least three problems with this idea. One is that workers in other industries need unions too because their jobs also suck. Some of those workers are currently IWW members and not all of them can change jobs to some key industry. The IWW needs to support and train and develop those members too. To do otherwise would be undemocratic.

A second problem is that the current level of training, experience, and dedication in the union is insufficient. The procedures for educating news members and developing a sense of Wobbly culture and community need to be better. I don't mean to put down the hard work of my fellow workers. I simply think that we still have a lot of work to do in this area. If we're talking about key sectors where we want to not only build unions but push forward revolutionary transformation then we will face tremendous repression. We have to be prepared for this repression. That means we have to develop better networks of solidarity and union infrastructure and a stronger Wobbly culture. The union busting we face when we organize image conscious restaurant chains or in the public sector is nowhere near as fierce as in manufacturing. We still have a hard time handling this in our campaigns. If we organize dockworkers or oil refinery workers the union busting we face will be much more intense than anything we have seen before. We need to get better at winning smaller campaigns in less important sectors of the economy before we charge up the mountain.

The level of repression which workers in pinchpoint industry face is an argument for not prioritizing those sectors for another reason. If workers in those industries are isolated, they will be more easily defeated. If organization and revolutionary consciousness is spread throughout the working class across different sectors then we will have a better chance at defeating that repression. If it's not, then the struggles in the pinchpoint sector or sectors will be more likely to lose--and the workers in other sectors may be less likely to unite with the workers in the pinchpoint sectors.

The experience of class struggle on the job can have a radicalizing effect. I've argued that we should organize in a way that maximizes this effect. This is important to counteract divisions between parts of our class. More important sectors of the economy are more likely to be well paid, and one response to major unrest is to improve conditions. The difference in income between the pinchpoint and nonpinchpoint workers can lead workers in the non-pinchpoint sectors to be less disposed toward solidarity.

I want to close by saying that the Pinchpoint Target is motivated by a sense of urgency. The idea is that prioritizing one sector or some key sectors will move the abolition of the wage system along faster. That's a worthwhile goal and that impatience is totally understandable. The world is a bad place in many ways and it needs to change. I'm not convinced that the Pinchpoint Target will help us, but I respect and share the sense of urgency of the fellow workers who hold to this idea.

http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-keep-motorized-vehicles-out-of-our-parks-20220127-m2k4zg5f2bhsxiuqmkxo3ttuyi-story.html,Keep motorized vehicles out of NYC parks,"We are all aware of the rapidly growing use of electric-powered mobility devices on the streets and sidewalks of Manhattan and elsewhere in the city. The number of e-scooters, e-bikes, mopeds and other such vehicles is exploding.

The good news is that these e-vehicles have zero emissions and offer an alternative form of transportation. Some use them for chores or for fun. The bad news is that many of the riders switched from public transportation to e-vehicles. Many of these vehicles are running red lights, riding on sidewalks or other forbidden lanes, and moving against traffic.

People wearing masks ride a scooter in Central Park on May 16, 2020 in New York City, amid the coronavirus pandemic.

There are applicable laws or regulations at each level of government. They are complicated, yet inadequate to cover the evolving technologies and their rapidly accelerating numbers. Speed is a major component of the problem; e-bikes can hit 25 mph or higher, and mopeds (gasoline fueled bicycles) can go much faster. The vehicles made with heavier metal combine mass together with speed. Speed, mass, and the aggregate number of vehicles are making them dangerous to others and to themselves.

Moreover, there is little to no enforcement of the laws we have. As a result, these vehicles are frightening people, especially the elderly and especially at night. The number of accidents is growing rapidly. The Times reported on Oct. 11, 2021, that there had been at least 17 e-vehicle riders and three pedestrians killed here between January and that date. In 2021, there were also 93 fires and four deaths caused by e-vehicle lithium batteries, compared to 44 fires and no deaths in 2020.

The increased use of e-vehicles (which now includes thousands of Citi Bikes that have been upgraded to e-bikes) is spilling over into city parks. I’m 76 and live on the Upper West Side across from Riverside Park. Every type of e-scooter, e-bike, moped, electric unicycle and skateboard has now invaded our parks, despite the fact that a Parks Department rule — Section 1-05(n) — “prohibits the use of motorized vehicles except on park roads and [in] designated park areas. This rule includes all devices that are propelled by a motor, including bikes and scooters.” In fact, electric unicycles and skateboards are not just prohibited in parks; they are banned from the city, but still can be seen.

During some evening rush hours, I have seen moped or e-bike riders in Riverside Park going north at high speeds on the narrow park path that runs between the Hudson River and the Parkway. Not surprisingly, they prefer park paths to slow street traffic and red lights. But inside Riverside Park, e-vehicles are all supposed to be barred (except, according to the police, when riders on a Class 1 e-bike are actually pedaling).

But there are nearly zero signs in Riverside Park or other parks laying out these rules. A rare exception (that proves the rule) is the presence of just two signs near the West Side Highway and 54 St. They both say: “NO MOTOR VEHICLES, E-BIKES. E-SCOOTERS”. One sign faces the West Side highway and is relatively useless; the other is rarely seen since few riders enter at that location.

The parks need many such signs, carefully placed.

Our ability to use the parks for quiet enjoyment or exercise by readers, walkers and pedal bikers is slowly diminishing. The e-bikes, scooters and mopeds, driven at high speeds, are whizzing by pedestrians, women pushing baby carriages, slower-moving pedal bikers, and people walking their dogs. If not addressed soon, this could grow beyond our capacity to manage; indeed, many would say we are already past that tipping point. Each of the several police officers I spoke with in Riverside Park urged me to write about the problem. They stated openly that they need and want help. One police sergeant responding to a letter from me wrote on Dec. 4: “These e-vehicles have become an increasing safety issue in our parks. Truly wish they were never created.”

If we are going to save our parks from being overrun with electric vehicles, we need to place appropriate signs at all entrances, and at key locations within. We also need to update the law and the penalties. The police officers I spoke with said that they ordinarily stay in their vehicles because they feel that city government hasn’t shown it cares, and there is very little they can do about the problem without help and changes in the law.

Bike rentals and sales need to be better regulated, bike speeds better controlled, and penalties enacted that really work. The number of police (or assistants) needs to be increased; they should be walking the paths, aided by many more signs and the pro-active support of the incoming Adams administration. We need limitations, and order restored, before the menace grows any larger.

What Kelly Turner Did to Olivia

Cops arrested Turner, formerly known as Kelly Gant, in Denver in 2019 after a grand jury indicted her for Olivia's death. The seven-year-old struggled with a mysterious illness, hospitalizations, and surgery for most of her young life.

Her mother claimed that she had problems digesting food and a seizure disorder because her brain had fluid build-up. Her cause of death was attributed to an intestinal failure. However, Olivia's body was exhumed in 2018 because of her mother's indictment. The autopsy revealed no evidence of any of the illnesses Turner claimed.

In the final weeks of Olivia's life, Turner convinced the hospital's multiple doctors that her illness was terminal. She was also able to make one doctor sign a ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR) order after she decided to stop all of Olivia's treatments and nourish her with a feeding tube.

Authorities saw cause to charge Turner with defrauding Medicaid of $538,000 and ripping off two charities, including the well-known Make-a-Wish Foundation. She also scammed hundreds of donors for various online fundraising efforts for Olivia's treatments. The police were also able to gather evidence that she stole from the funeral home and the cemetery where her daughter was buried.

Suspicions were raised against the mother after she claimed shortly after Olivia's death that her teenage daughter was diagnosed with cancer. However, the girl's medical records belied her claims.

What is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy?

District Court Judge Patricia Herron said that Turner's case had been a challenging study on Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP). According to the University of Michigan Health, MSBP is a mental health disorder that involves a person, usually a caregiver, who makes up a patient's illnesses. MSBP may be considered a form of abuse.

Herron said that MSBP could be heinous, dangerous, and deadly. She also noted that the scenario could be a ""horrific, depraved condition"" that could lead to death, as in this case, when undetected.

The district attorney's office is also looking into the Children's Hospital Colorado for accountability as they failed to see Turner's suspicious intentions and never reported her to the police. If they had done this, Olivia's life might have been saved.

Olivia's grandfather, Lonnie Gautreau, said he wants the truth to save other children in the same situation. Reports cited that the hospital settled with the family behind closed doors.",Q1

In the wake of what I am inclined to call Black Lives Matter Madness (BLMM), a self-righteous mob in the city of Bristol, England, toppled a statue of Edward Colston and threw it into the waters of the River Avon.

That the 125-year-old statue was an aesthetic adornment to the city at a time when such adornments are completely beyond the capacity of all but one or two of our sculptors counted for nothing in the mind of the mob, infatuated as it was by its own bravery and moral grandeur.

Edward Colston (1636–1721) was a merchant and philanthropist who used much of his fortune to endow schools, hospitals, and almshouses for the poor (of considerable architectural merit). He also was a slave trader, albeit at a time when slavery was approved of morally by almost the whole of the educated class and could be carried out only with the cooperation of African slave-hunters, Europeans being unable at the time to penetrate Africa beyond a few coastal stations.

Four members of the mob who toppled the statue were arrested and charged with criminal damage. They’ve just been acquitted of the charge by a jury, though it was at no time denied by the defense that they had committed the acts of which they were accused.

There was no suggestion that the police had fabricated the evidence against them. They were acquitted (naturally to their own rejoicing) on the grounds that they were acting morally—that they were motivated by a desire for historical justice. Their defense attorneys told the jury that the four people were “on the right side of history”—as Colston had believed himself to be more than three centuries earlier.

A Labour Member of Parliament rejoiced at the verdict almost as much as did the accused.

“A British jury has confirmed the toppling of Edward Colston’s statue was not a criminal act,“ the Parliament member said. ”The real crime was the fact the statue was still there when protesters pulled it down. Today’s verdict makes a compelling case that the majority of the British public want to deal with our colonial and slave-trading past.”

Let’s pass over the fact that a single jury of 12 (of whom one voted for conviction) can’t be taken to represent the majority of a population of scores of millions and that a different jury might have found differently. What’s remarkable about the MP’s response is that it doesn’t consider the implications of the verdict if it were to set a precedent.

It would mean that acts normally considered criminal would cease to be so provided that those who committed them were “on the right side of history” and were motivated by what they claimed to be profound moral sentiments (but which are actually very superficial indeed).

Upon reading of the acquittal, I couldn’t help but think of the attempted assassination of Gen. Dmitri Trepov by Vera Zasulich in 1878. Trepov, the governor of St. Petersburg, Russia, had ordered the flogging of prisoner Arkhip Bogolyubov, a revolutionary, after the latter refused to remove his cap in Trepov’s presence. Zasulich, herself a revolutionary, shot and wounded—but didn’t kill—Trepov in an act of revenge.

Zasulich, who was motivated by moral outrage, was subsequently acquitted at her trial, which was turned into a de facto trial of the victim, Trepov, by the defense.

At the time, the acquittal was seen, at least by the intelligentsia, as a triumph for social justice: Trepov had got what he deserved and Zasulich was a heroine. But in retrospect, the acquittal was disastrous, for it surely wasn’t up to citizens to decide who could rightfully be shot, and there was no doubt as to the facts of this case, which were even more certain than they were in the Bristol case.

The verdict in a court of law had undermined or was in complete contradiction to the concept of the rule of law or even of the need for law at all. If citizens could carry out acts of revenge with impunity in the name of justice, what need would there be for such cumbersome procedures as trials?

But as Francis Bacon, attorney and philosopher put it four centuries ago: “Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more man’s nature runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.

“For as for the first wrong, it doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that wrong, putteth the law out of office.”

In other words, if every man can break the law when he feels so inclined by his sense of outrage, no law remains.

The Zasulich acquittal was a stage on the slippery slope to Bolshevism, responsible for more violent deaths in a week than the Tsarist regime had caused in a century.

While the statue of Colston was being pulled down, statues of George Floyd were being erected. This was surely very curious. Floyd’s moral qualities as a person shouldn’t be relevant to the question of the wrongfulness of his death, of course, as it’s just as wrong to kill a bad person as a good. But they should be relevant to how he’s remembered.

Floyd was guilty of many crimes, at least one of them being very nasty indeed. He threatened a pregnant woman (black, incidentally) whose house he had broken into with a gun. Erecting a statue to such a man could be interpreted as both the glorification of armed robbery and the grossest of misogyny.

It seems obvious to me that no statue should be erected to him. Victimhood is no virtue and can’t redeem a crime. To erect statues to him is nothing short of disgraceful and to turn him into a hero is—or ought to be considered—an insult to black people everywhere.

However, feeling as I do about this doesn’t entitle me to pull the statues down where they’ve been erected legally. I can argue against them, campaign and start petitions for their removal, and so forth, but I can’t take the law into my own hands.

Moreover, even if I succeeded in my campaign, I should be inclined to preserve the statues somewhere or other rather than to destroy them—as monuments to human folly and moral confusion. It’s always timely to be reminded of human folly and moral confusion.

In 2018, former President Donald Trump placed a 25% levy on imported steel, in a bid to stabilize domestic production.



Nathan Fraser, vice president and general manager of Nucor Steel Indiana, said the move gave companies confidence to reinvest in their operations, including a planned $290 million expansion of Nucor's Crawfordsville plant. Fraser noted it will add 75 or more jobs in the next two years.



""These investments that Nucor and other Indiana steel producers are making are transforming our old Rust Belt into a hub for a modern, sustainable steel industry that's going to be providing the advanced, 'clean steel' products that our nation needs to build for the 21st century,"" Fraser asserted.



The Biden administration has rolled back the blanket 25% tariffs over the past several months, in an effort to ease supply-chain woes. New agreements with the European Union and Japan call for tariff rate quotas, where higher levels of imports come with higher tariffs, a measure the administration said will prevent those nations from flooding U.S. markets with steel.



Heather Ennis, president and CEO of the Northwest Indiana Forum, agreed the Trump-era tariffs have created stability for Hoosier plants, which accounted for more than a quarter of the nation's overall steel production in 2020, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Indiana has been the number one steel producer in the U.S. for the past 40 years.



""To be able to have some certainty and to know that they have the resources available to be able to put more money into plants, upgrades and things like that, is really very beneficial for our economy here in northwest Indiana,"" Ennis contended.



Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., is also pushing to keep the tariffs in place, and said they are an important measure to support U.S. steel. He argued import quota agreements with allied countries can be managed while protecting domestic steel production, but when it comes to more hostile nations, he said the administration should move carefully.



""Dealing with Japan and the E.U. is a much different venture, because it's got a little bit of a handshake and trust to it,"" Braun explained. ""I don't know if there's any of that with the relationship with China.""



According to the World Steel Association, China is the number one producer of steel in the world, although its production outstrips domestic demand. In August 2021, China produced more than 83 million tons of steel, compared to 7.5 million tons in the U.S.

Programs in North Carolina and across the country are bringing energy efficiency to rural customers without breaking the bank.



Known as Inclusive Utility Investments, the programs provide upgrades at low repayment rates so customers do not go into debt and save money on their energy bills.



Roanoke Cooperative in North Carolina has a program called ""Upgrade to $ave,"" which provides the service.



Susan Williams, community services coordinator for the cooperative, said the loan for upgrades is usually paid back over 12 years.



""Although they may have the added amount, the upgrades bring the amount of the bill down to a point where even adding the tariff to the bill, the member-owner still shows savings,"" Williams explained. ""And their home is more energy efficient.""



Rural Americans spend up to 40% more on energy than their urban counterparts, according to the Rural Power Coalition. Utilities in 10 states have invested more than $50 million through Inclusive Utility Investments, with a 99% cost-recovery rate.



The Rural Energy Savings Program and other federal programs make the investments possible for electric cooperatives. Williams pointed out the program has big benefits for the region Roanoke Cooperative serves.



""We have probably three of the poorest counties in North Carolina that we service,"" Williams observed. ""We are always looking for ways to make things better for our members.""



Williams noted many of the 14,000 member-owners of Roanoke Cooperative live in substandard housing and the cooperative provides free health and safety upgrades. She added energy efficiency lowers Roanoke Cooperative's bill, as well.

Connecticut groups are rallying today against a natural gas pipeline expansion.



Project Maple would extend Enbridge's natural-gas pipeline stretching from New Jersey to Rhode Island with sections running under Connecticut. Residents' feedback is negative since it would increase statewide energy costs. Gov. Ned Lamont supported natural-gas expansion in his State of the State Address.



Sena Wazer, intern for the Connecticut Chapter of the Sierra Club, said now is not the time for an expansion.



""Right now, we're seeing massive federal rollbacks on climate action and climate progress,"" Wazer pointed out. ""It is really important for our states to step up and to do better. Especially here in New England, many of our states including Connecticut pride themselves on being climate leaders and this is really a step in the wrong direction.""



A 2024 Sierra Club report found building up offshore wind energy would save Connecticut residents around $3 a month on their energy bills. While renewable energy projects have higher up-front costs, they lower costs for people in the long run.



If Project Maple does go forward, it will be operational by November 2029. The Sierra Club and other groups are hosting a rally outside Eversource's Hartford headquarters at 3 p.m.



While Connecticut has long been a renewable energy and climate change policy leader, progress on the goals has stagnated in recent years. Wazer feels Lamont's recent recommendation of certain climate bills shows he wants to keep the state's climate goals alive. But she argued he must do more.



""It is not enough to recognize that climate change is impacting us,"" Wazer contended. ""It's also really critical to take action to mitigate the impacts that we are having on climate change.""



Reports show Connecticut is behind on achieving its 2030 and 2050 climate goals. The state's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said accelerating emission reduction projects would help the state make its goals.



Natural gas is Connecticut's largest energy source, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Choices can carry a price

EDITOR: I used to smoke cigarettes. At age 37, I was buying life insurance and a blood test detected nicotine, resulting in a 40% premium increase. I was shocked and called my insurance agent. I said, “Carl, what gives, why a 40% bump?”

Carl said, “That’s the smoker’s penalty. Smokers die sooner than nonsmokers.”

“They can’t charge me extra for smoking,” I said. “That’s like mandating my behavior. That’s not fair, and it’s my choice.”

Carl replied, “Sure, it’s your constitutional right to smoke, but it isn’t your right to have people that don’t smoke help pay for your insurance for the diseases that befall you because you fail to heed the warnings about smoking.”

I quit smoking, which dropped my insurance rate. I had come to agree that it wasn’t right for other people to subsidize my poor health choices.

Lately I’ve wondered why we are subsidizing the poor health choices of the unvaccinated. They certainly have the constitutional right to their choices, but they should also carry the full financial burden of those choices. What do you think?

Boogaloo killings

EDITOR: West Below asked that we keep Jan. 6, 2021, in perspective as nine people were killed in Black Lives Matter protests vs. five at the Capitol (“Anniversary nears,” Letters, Monday).

I don’t know about all nine deaths relating to Black Lives Matter, but in Northern California the first killing was on May 29, 2020 in Oakland. Steven Carrillo, a member of the right-wing Boogaloo movement, has been charged with killing a federal officer. Authorities say he used a Black Lives Matter demonstration as cover for the crime and his escape. Carrillo and a second man, Robert Justus, have been charged in connection with another shooting two weeks later in Ben Lomond that killed a Santa Cruz County sheriff’s sergeant. Authorities say they wanted to start another civil war.

So, yes, let’s keep it in perspective. Some members of the far right want to “take back our country” by any means. Let’s not confuse Jan. 6 rioters with people wanting our government to provide equal protection for all.

Not all conservatives are trying to overthrow the government, but it seems the majority want to compare Black Lives Matter protests with the Jan. 6 insurrection. Everyone needs to denounce the movement to thwart our election, not try to justify it.

Mike Pence, unsung hero

EDITOR: Mike Pence was Donald Trump’s last hope to cling to power. All the legal challenges had failed. Trump and his lawyers tried to convince the vice president that he had the constitutional authority to prevent the certification of electoral votes due to alleged voter fraud. Pence was under tremendous pressure from the president’s camp not to certify the election and to instead throw it back to the states.

Critics say Pence just did his job by certifying the votes. Sure, but if he had gone along with the president and failed to do his job, this country would have been thrown into a constitutional crisis, causing irreparable harm to our democracy.

Pence could not have been a more loyal vice president. As his reward, he was thrown under the bus by Trump, who demands loyalty but gives none in return. Contrast this to the character of Pence who refused to be evacuated from the Capitol as Trump loyalists stormed the building shouting, “Hang Mike Pence.” Pence did not leave the Capitol until Joe Biden was certified the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Thanks to Pence, for finally stepping up.

GOP and rioters

EDITOR: Your article about Evan Neumann described a radical and apparently violent person who participated in the attempt to overturn our legitimate election (“Indictment alleges man’s role in riot,” Dec. 14). Currently in Belarus, Neumann has taken to insulting the United States in the service of the Belarusian dictatorship.

I think it is important to point out that Neumann and others of his ilk who participated in the attack on the Capitol are considered “patriots” by Donald Trump and luminaries of the Republican Party, i.e. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar, Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert.

Many others in the GOP have chosen to ignore the attempted coup or are busy revising the history of the treasonous events that occurred on Jan. 6, 2021. In too many ways, Neumann’s unfortunate descent mirrors the current trajectory of the Republican Party.

Feeling less liberal

EDITOR: I have been a liberal all my life, but it’s getting harder. Aside from political correctness, like censoring comedians and speakers at colleges, there is off-putting language such as “defund the police” and “women, or those who give birth.”

Then, there are real, ongoing problems of unintended consequences. Stealing or fencing stolen goods totaling $950 or less is a misdemeanor, which is basically a slap on the wrist. Now smash-and-grab theft and catalytic converter theft are commonplace. With no real penalty, it will continue to be so.

You reported that suspected drug dealers who had 33 pounds of methamphetamine and 3,000 fentanyl pills, as well as guns, were released with no bail (“Warrants issued for 2 in seizure of drugs, guns,” Dec. 23). Police allow sideshows to happen and usually don’t arrest anybody. On the Fourth of July, there were illegal fireworks all night long with few consequences. Homeless encampments are allowed to exist for months before they are cleaned up.

If people don’t feel safe and lose faith that their government will respond to their concerns, they often turn to soomeone they believe is a law-and-order strongman. We can either address these problems head on or wait for the coming right-wing dictatorship.

City Council approved a resolution Thursday directing the county's board of elections to place the proposed five-year levy, which will help fund Fremont's road remediation program, on the ballot for the May 3 primary election.

""I would like to see a more coordinated campaign to get it passed,"" said council member John Elder.

Funding would be used for five-year repair effort

City voters rejected the proposed income tax levy in November that would have helped fund an ambitious five-year road program to repair Fremont's streets.

Unofficial results from the Sandusky County Board of Elections showed 1,024 voters, or 54.82%, voted against the income tax levy, with 848 voters in favor.

The city's ambitions to spruce up major thoroughfares such as State Street banked on whether voters would approve the income tax levy.

The full scope of the city's proposed five-year road remediation program was projected to cost $12-$14 million, Auditor Paul Grahl told the council June 3.

Grahl said the engineer's office looked at streets in all four quadrants and evaluated road conditions, traffic counts and other factors for recommended remediation and treatment.

Some major thoroughfares within the road program would be West and East State streets and Oak Harbor Road.

Mayor: Educating voters on road issue is key to passing the levy

Mayor Danny Sanchez said he felt one of the main reasons the levy failed in November is a lack of information about the city's road program and why it was needed.

""Most of the people I spoke to after the election were surprised it didn't pass,"" Sanchez said.

Sanchez asked council members for a bipartisan effort to reach voters and inform them about the levy and the road program.

He said he thought it would take a city-wide door-to-door campaign to educate voters and businesses about the need for extensive repairs to Fremont's streets.

The jury’s verdict laid to rest questions of who was responsible for a crime that went unsolved for a decade and then dragged through the courts for another.

Melvin Sandoval, 42, and Santos Grimaldi, 39, were convicted of first-degree murder in the death of the 13-year-old girl, Jacqueline Piazza. Because the jury found that Sandoval and Grimaldi murdered Jacqueline in the commission of a rape and while committing a lewd act on a child, the men must be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Rogelio Contreras, 44, was convicted of second-degree murder. The jury found that all three men killed Jacqueline for the benefit of their gang, MS-13.

Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler scheduled their sentencing for May 13.

Another MS-13 member, Jorge Palacios, was convicted in 2018 of murdering and kidnapping Jacqueline. Now 43, he is serving life without the possibility of parole.

Jacqueline had run away from her family’s home in Whittier and ended up on the streets of Los Angeles’ Westlake district when, on the afternoon of June 27, 2001, she met Palacios a few blocks west of MacArthur Park. Palacios was selling drugs there, according to an appellate decision that summarized the evidence in his trial, and for a reason authorities could never discern, believed the teenager was a “chavala,” or enemy of his gang.

Palacios and his girlfriend threw Jacqueline to the ground and beat her, then told Sandoval and Grimaldi to take the girl somewhere, rape her and “get rid of her,” a witness testified at trial.

With Jacqueline stashed in the trunk, Contreras drove Sandoval, Grimaldi and a female MS-13 member to Elysian Park, where Grimaldi and Sandoval raped the girl, according to testimony. She was shot twice in the head, her body left on a hillside in the dark.

The case went unsolved for a decade, until the female MS-13 member told detectives what she had witnessed. DNA evidence from Jacqueline’s body linked Grimaldi and Sandoval to her rape, and another witness told authorities that Sandoval, Grimaldi and Contreras had told him details of the crime years later. Contreras, the witness testified, had once said he could “still see her ghost in my car.”

Palacios, Sandoval, Grimaldi and Contreras were charged with the girl’s murder in 2012. It emerged during the investigation that beginning around 2004, Palacios had worked as an informant for the FBI and had been used to infiltrate MS-13 cells in Nebraska, Maryland, Virginia, Florida and Indiana, according to an agent’s testimony in a Nebraska prosecution. He helped agents collect evidence in drug and gun cases and a murder-for-hire plot.

For his work, the bureau paid Palacios more than $300,000, the agent said. Asked by a defense attorney if Palacios had made more money selling drugs — his source of income prior to becoming an informant — “or more money working for the FBI,” the agent responded: “I don’t know.”

The bureau continued using Palacios as an informant after being told in early 2009 that he was suspected of having killed a 13-year-old girl, the agent testified.

Palacios was tried separately from his co-defendants on the charge of kidnapping and murdering Jacqueline. He was convicted, but a jury deadlocked in the case against Sandoval, Grimaldi and Contreras in 2018.

For the retrial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dayan Mathai, who had worked with the detectives investigating the murder since 2010, said he decided to hone in on evidence from the crime scene. In the first trial, witness testimony had formed the heart of the prosecution’s case, but the defendants’ attorneys had attacked their credibility and raised doubts about their motives in coming forward.

Mathai said he wanted to show to the jury “what the crime scene told us what happened”: physical evidence that Jacqueline had been raped on the hillside, blood spatter that showed where her body was positioned, and the DNA of two defendants. Many witnesses from the first trial testified again in the second, but prosecutors stressed how their testimony aligned with evidence from the scene, Mathai said.

The second trial was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed in May 2021, with jurors hearing testimony and closing arguments until last week, when they began deliberating.

“We feel the jury spoke, and it was a full and complete test of the evidence,” Mathai said. “In excruciating detail, every issue was litigated, every witness was called, tested, cross-examined.

“Our theme was what happened to Jacqueline demanded an answer,” he said. “A 13-year-old is sexually assaulted — raped — and left naked with two bullets in the back of her head. It took this long to get it, but now we have an answer. Now we have the answer.”",Q1
https://www.arabnews.com/node/2031336/middle-east,Houthis abduct two more Yemeni employees of US embassy in Sanaa,"AL-MUKALLA: The Iran-backed Houthis have abducted two more Yemeni employees of the US embassy in Sanaa, according to a lawyer in the city. Meanwhile the militia has ordered the seizure of more properties belonging to its opponents.

Abdul Majeed Sabra, a Yemeni lawyer who defends abductees held in Houthi prisons, told Arab News on Thursday that two press officers at the shuttered US embassy in Sanaa have been detained. They were identified as Abdul Rahman Al-Sharabi and Nabiel Sultan.

The latest detentions come almost four months after the Houthis stormed the embassy compound, seized the property and detained about two dozen local workers.

When Arab News contacted the US Department of State, a spokesperson refused to confirm or deny the latest reports of abductions, citing concerns about the safety of embassy staff, but said that efforts are being made to secure the release of all detained workers.

“We condemn the Houthis’ continued detention of US and UN local Yemeni staff in Sanaa in the strongest possible terms,” he said. “This action sends worrying signals about the Houthi commitment to peace and intentions toward the international community.”

The US closed its embassy in the Yemeni capital in 2015 and American staff left the country as the Houthis tightened their grip on power after overthrowing the internationally recognized administration of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

Armed Houthis occupied the US embassy compound in November and detained at least two dozen Yemeni staff. Nearly half were released but the militia has refused to free the rest despite mounting local and international pressure and condemnations.

In December, two UN organizations accused the Houthis of abducting two members of their staff a month earlier and called on the militia to release them immediately.

Meanwhile, a former spokesperson for the Houthis said on Wednesday that the militia’s authorities had seized his house and other property in Dhamar province.

Ali Al-Bukhaiti defected from the movement and fled the country, first to Jordan and then the UK. He said that a group of Houthi officials led by his brother, Mohammed Al-Bukhaiti, who governs Dhamar, had taken his house in their home province as part of new seizure orders targeting opponents of the militia. He added that the Houthis previously stole furniture from his law office in Sanaa, but vowed that he would continue to oppose the movement and its leader, Abdul Malik Al-Houthi.

“What happened confirms what we had said earlier, that Abdul Malik Al-Houthi is just a thief and a gang leader,” Al-Bukhaiti said on Twitter.“By the way, I say: Just as the confiscation of the law firm and the furniture of the villa in Sanaa did not affect me, the confiscation of my house in Dhamar will not change my position.”

Since seizing power militarily in Yemen in late 2014, the Houthis have used judicial authorities in the areas they control to issue seizure orders and justify looting the properties of hundreds of Yemeni military officials, politicians, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists who fled rebel-held territories.

Also on Wednesday, a court run by the Houthis in Sanaa sentenced three people, including the principal of a private school in the city, to death. They were charged with forming armed groups and colluding with the Yemeni government and the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen.

Elsewhere, warplanes from the coalition reportedly have destroyed a large amount Houthi military equipment in the northern province of Hajjah, where the militia is attempting to seize strategic areas controlled by the government in the districts of Haradh and Abes.

But long before they arrived in Maine’s Prettiest Village, Wiscasset had a connection to the Lone Star State. Listen now to the story of the four Wiscasset brothers who fought in the Texas War for Independence from Mexico. They didn’t stand with Col. Travis, Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie at the Alamo, but two of them fought with Gen. Sam Houston at San Jacinto, the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution on April 21, 1836.

The Wiscasset foursome were the Sevey brothers, Manasseh, Ralph, Joseph and Theodore. They were the sons of Col. Samuel and Hannah Sevey who resided on a farm just south of the village. The elder Sevey earned his military title for having commanded an artillery company in the Massachusetts Militia during the War of 1812.

Ralph Sevey, the oldest of the four brothers, left Wiscasset to seek his fortune in Kentucky. He was soon joined by Manasseh, a graduate of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, class of 1832. It was after attending a recruiting rally in Lexington the brothers enlisted in the Texas cause. They signed on with Capt. Sidney Sherman’s Company of Kentucky volunteers that gained fame for their shooting accuracy and came to be called the “Kentucky Rifles.” The Sevey brothers and other volunteers joined the fight with the promise of free land in the new republic should the insurrection against Mexico prove successful.

The two Wiscasset natives arrived in the territory of Texas in January 1836. Manasseh and Ralph Sevey’s names appear on the muster roll of Capt. William Woods, commander of Company A of the 1st Regiment. The military records also reveal the Sevey brothers took part in the historic San Jacinto battle on April 21, 1836. General Sam Houston himself led the volunteers in the fight with the rallying cry, “Remember the Alamo!” Houston’s volunteer army engaged and defeated General Santa Anna’s Mexican regulars in a fight that lasted under 30 minutes!

After the fighting was over Ralph and Manasseh remained in Texas. Manasseh transferred to the Engineering Corps and continued serving in the Texas Army as a lieutenant until May 4, 1837. According to historical records available through the San Jacinto Museum at La Porte, Texas, Manasseh Sevey settled in the growing frontier city of Houston and soon became involved in politics. He was elected a city alderman and obtained a minor post in the newly formed Texas government.

But then Manasseh’s story took a strange twist. In January 1839, he legally changed his first name to William. Strange indeed because Manasseh had an older brother named William who had died five years earlier in the city of New Orleans. Manasseh abruptly left a promising career in Texas politics and moved to Louisiana and became a surveyor. He sold his Texas land and settled in Baton Rouge. A few years later, he married a Southern belle, Margaret S. Miller, the daughter of the Donaldsonville postmaster in Ascension Parish. He remained there until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. He then fled the Land of Dixie, and returned alone to Wiscasset where he resumed using Manasseh as his first name. He died at the family farm in Wiscasset on Jan. 29, 1863, at the age of 51. His grave can be found in the Sevey family cemetery near Sevey Hill.

Ralph Sevey, too, had distinguished himself in battle; Gen. Sam Houston himself recommend him for promotion to 2nd lieutenant. In 1838 Ralph was issued 640 acres in Harris County, Texas. But his life, too, took an unexpected turn and not for the better. After shooting and killing a rival, he abruptly left Texas never to return. After moving to New Orleans, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served five years at Fort Gratiot on Lake Huron in Michigan. After leaving the Army, Ralph then settled in Michigan at Huron City, a lumber camp. He lived there alone for 25 years under an assumed name, Robert Emerson. Back home in Wiscasset his family thought Ralph had died. Then in May 1871 the family received a letter postmarked Huron City, Michigan. “This may surprise you but it is nevertheless true, it is your brother Ralph who writes you,” he wrote to his astonished family. Five years later, Ralph decided to return to Wiscasset; he was preparing for the trip home when he died suddenly. His body was found on August 17, near the head of Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron, the cause of his death is unknown.

The other Sevey brothers, Joseph and Theodore Sevey traveled far different paths in their Texas adventures. Joseph, born in 1807 witnessed the Texas War for Independence from a different perspective, the sea. He enlisted in the Texas Navy and also rose to the rank of lieutenant. Military service records archived for the Republic of Texas reveal Ralph served aboard three different ships: two schooners the, Invincible and Liberty, and a steamer called the, Cayuga.

Following the war Joseph returned to Wiscasset, settled down and in 1853 married Sarah Taylor, a local lass. He lived a long life, outliving all but one of his 12 brothers and sisters. He passed away quietly at the age of 81 in 1888.

Theodore Sevey, the youngest of the four brothers was the 10th child of Samuel and Hannah Sevey. Born in 1818, he was 18 or 19 years old, when the Texas War for Independence broke out. Unlike his brothers Theodore Sevey was intent on a military career from a young age, his name appears on the 1836 Cadet Register for the United States Military Academy at West Point. After graduating from the academy, he headed west to join his brothers and enlisted in the newly formed Republic of Texas Army. Military payroll records archived in the Texas State Library reveal that Theodore Sevey was paid both as a private and later as a lieutenant from 1840 to 1841. Other records show of Theodore Sevey’s nomination and approval as a first lieutenant. Arriving too late to fight in the Texas War for Independence Theodore took part in the July 1840 offensive against the Comanches. Lt. Theodore Sevey rose quickly in the ranks, he was promoted to adjutant, serving as administrative secretary to his commander Captain William G. Lewis of Company E.

In 1841, Lt. Theodore Sevey was part of the ill-fated Texas Santa Fe Expedition, the young republic’s attempt at gaining control of the then Mexican-controlled Santa Fe Trail. The expedition, which started off from Austin in June 1841, included over 300 soldiers under the command of Brigadier General Hugh McCleod. Unfortunately, things went badly from the outset. The troops were harassed by hostile Indians and soon found themselves short on supplies, including water. At one point the expedition lost its bearings. After arriving at their destination three months later, they were met by a force of 1,500 Mexican regulars. Being greatly outnumbered, the proud Texans surrendered. They were then forced by their captors to march 2,000 miles as prisoners of war to Mexico City.

Military records include Lt. Theodore Sevey’s name among a list of officers taken prisoner. In June 1842 Lt. Sevey died of yellow fever during the long cruel march. He is buried somewhere near the Puente Nacional bridge, a landmark stone bridge still standing today that spans the Antigua River. Theodore Sevey was 23 or 24 when he died.

That all too briefly is the story of the four Wiscasset brothers who joined the fight for Texas independence.

William Edward Vaden, 33, pleaded guilty last month to gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated in connection with the death of Juan Muniz III, who was struck while crossing an Oceanside street during the early morning hours of Jan. 26, 2020.

Vaden hit Muniz around 1:10 a.m. while the Marine from Kingsville, Texas, was crossing Coast Highway near Sportfisher Drive, according to police and prosecutors. Paramedics took Muniz to Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, where he died about an hour later, according to the Medical Examiner’s Office.

Vaden, who remained at the scene, was initially arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Prosecutors charged him about six months later with murder due to a 2010 DUI conviction in San Diego County.

At Vaden’s arraignment, Deputy District Attorney David Uyar said the defendant had a blood-alcohol content of .22 percent, nearly three times the legal limit to drive a vehicle in California.

The prosecutor said Vaden had finished work and stopped by several Oceanside-area bars prior to the fatal collision.",Q1

https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2022/01/27/he-called-nra-terrorist-for-not-supporting-gun-control-now-he-wants-to-represent-me-in-congress-n54887,"He called the NRA terrorists. Now he's running for Congress to ""restore civility""","Andy Parker has experienced one of the worst things that can ever happen to a parent; the murder of their child. Parker’s daughter Alison was killed along with her co-worker Adam Ward in August of 2016 as they were conducting a live television interview at Smith Mountain Lake in central Virginia. Their killer was a former colleague at the Roanoke television station where Parker and Ward worked who’d been fired two years earlier after complains that he had been making co-workers feel threatened and uncomfortable.

In the aftermath of his daughter’s death, Andy Parker became a vocal proponent of gun control and an outspoken critic of anyone who dared to disagree with his ideas. In fact, in 2016 Parker even called me a terrorist during an interview with CNN in reaction to my comments on NRA News about a Democratic pro-gun control publicity stunt on the floor of the House of Representatives.

“The real terrorists are the folks at the NRA. Those are the terrorists. And unfortunately, you have politicians that are complicit — they’ve pledged allegiance to the NRA versus the United States of America and the safety of its citizens,” Parker said to CNN. Parker made these comments in response to a NRA radio host, Cam Edwards, who criticized the democratic lawmakers and the leader of the sit-in, Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who were holding a sit in on the House floor. “So in order to push legislation that the sponsors say would not have prevented the attacks in Orlando, Florida, they’re also going to flout the House rules. Kind of like, you know, criminals and terrorists flout the rules that we have in place right now and will continue to do so,” Edwards said.

Honestly, I didn’t take Parker’s insult personally at the time and I feel the same way today. Alison Parker and Adam Ward’s deaths were senseless and tragic, and while I will never agree with him that more gun control laws will lead to a safer society, he’s certainly entitled to his own opinion and activism. That doesn’t mean, however, that I want him representing me in Congress.

Parker announced Thursday that he will seek the Democratic nomination in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District to challenge one of the most conservative members of the House and an ardent gun-rights supporter, Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) — a tough race for a Democrat. But Parker said that fighting gun violence, though still important to him, is not the focal point of his congressional campaign. Over the past few years, Parker has been battling YouTube and other social-media platforms as he looks to remove videos of his daughter Alison Parker’s violent death. He said he hoped taking on Big Tech and amending Section 230 — a provision in the Communications Decency Act that has largely shielded social media platforms from accountability if content posted on their sites causes harm — would be an issue that could “transcend parties” and unite people across the political spectrum in the 5th District.

I suppose that could be an issue that can unite people across the political spectrum in the 5th District, but Parker’s not going to be a uniting candidate. I mean, it’s one thing to say you’re running to restore decency and civility that’s “sorely lacking,” but it’s hard to square that with Parker’s actual history of blaming Republicans and Second Amendment activists for the actions of cold-blooded killers. Here’s what he wrote in the fall of 2015, for example.

Republican legislators across the country refuse to consider common sense measures to prevent the horrific gun violence that kills our loved ones each and every day. By refusing to act, they are aiding and abetting domestic terrorism. Shame on them for being the cowards that they are. Is the support of a fringe element of the NRA so important that they are willing to accept our children as collateral damage? We are at war in this country, and we must win – whatever it takes. … The Republican Party is in the pocket of the NRA. They are either too afraid of them or they like taking their money. Either way, they aren’t standing up to do something constructive to try and stop this. This is domestic terrorism. The NRA and the Republican Party have blood on their hands.

Whoever wins the Democratic primary in the 5th Congressional District is going to face an uphill battle to win the seat in November. Not only are Republicans poised for a massive red wave election nationally this fall, but the 5th District is considered a pretty safe seat for Republicans. In 2020 Bob Good defeated Democrat Cameron Webb by about five points, and even in 2018’s blue wave election Republican Denver Riggleman vanquished Democrat Leslie Cockburn by a slightly higher margin. And under redistricting maps approved by the Virginia State Supreme Court, the 5th District is going to become even redder than it’s been in previous election cycles.

So, I’m not particularly concerned about Andy Parker’s chances of electoral success. If anything, I’m perplexed by his campaign strategy.

“My priority for running in this race is putting a stop to the abuse of social media,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “I don’t want people to go through the same thing I went through. I tried working this effort as a private citizen, and I think if I could do it as a member of Congress, even though I’d be one of 400-plus members, I’d have a better chance of getting something done.” … Parker said he felt that he didn’t need to lead with his advocacy on gun safety as part of his congressional campaign because it’s essentially “baked in,” and voters could expect him to support legislation such as universal background checks in Congress. “People know that’s what I do,” he said. “I feel proud of my effort to help Virginia pass common-sense gun legislation.”

No offense to Andy Parker, but I think abuse of social media is pretty low in importance for most voters in the 5th District, and I say that as someone who’s so fed up with social media that I haven’t tweeted or posted on any platform in months. Then again, the less he talks about his support for gun control, the less explaining he has to do about statements like this.

Andy Parker said shooting assault weapons should be restricted to a gun range, and individuals should not own assault weapons, but rather users at gun ranges should just check out such weapons, like library books, and return them before leaving.

As for people expecting him to back more gun control proposals, I suppose for those who’ve actually heard of Parker that’s true, but my guess is he’s going to need to introduce himself to the voters of the 5th District, and while he can expect widespread sympathy for his daughter’s murder, I don’t expect that to translate into support for his anti-gun agenda once voters have had a chance to examine his record and rhetoric, especially if he’s going to try to mitigate his previous statements with stuff like this:

“I grew up in Texas. I was a hunter,” he said. “I believe in the right to bear arms, to protect your family, go hunting. I’m not a gun grabber.”

Here’s the thing. When you’re touting California’s gun control laws as the model for Virginia to follow, your claim of belief in the right to bear arms is laughable. What does the right to bear arms look like in California? You have to demonstrate some special need that justifies you carrying a firearm in self-defense, and that’s a far cry from the shall-issue standard (and permitless open carry) that’s the law in Virginia. Honestly, I don’t think Andy Parker can win the general no matter what he does, but trying to run as some sort of moderate on gun control is just insulting to the voters of the 5th District.

And frankly, it remains to be seen if Parker can even win his party’s primary. There are three other Democrats who’ve declared their own candidacies, and Charlottesville attorney Lewis Combs is currently leading the fundraising race. If gun control groups like Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety throw some Bloomberg bucks Parker’s way then this could be a much more competitive primary, but Parker’s positions on the Second Amendment make him a non-starter in the general.",Q1
https://tribune.com.pk/story/2343733/bsac-shows-solidarity-with-medical-students,BSAC shows solidarity with medical students,"Baloch Students Action Committee (BSAC) Tuesday held a protest in front of Quetta Press Club to show solidarity with the students of medical colleges whose licences have been cancelled by Pakistan Medical Council (MPC).

Protesters carried placards and banners and chanted slogans demanding that the medical colleges should be recognized by the PMC because the future of their students hanged in the balance.

Addressing the protestors, the leaders of BSAC demanded registration of Balochistan’s medical colleges by PMC whose NOC had been withdrawn and rejected PMC’s proposed special exam from the students.

“600 students of three medical colleges of Balochistan have been protesting against PMC’s decision of special exam for the last 73 days but no one has been listening to them,” he said.

“The medical students after a 73-day long sit-in have decided to go on hunger strike till death. The condition of three medical students has deteriorated and they have been shifted to hospital for medical treatment,” he added.

Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo had promised that the issue would be resolved but so far, on the part of the provincial government there is no progress on this front, he said.

The protesting students further blamed that if nine medical colleges in Punjab and other provinces can be registered without special exam, then an exam for the students of three medical colleges of Balochistan is unjust.

They further complained that Balochistan is already backward and education resources are not relatively widespread and despite meager resources, students have continued their studies.

They pointed out that after the 18th amendment, the education and health sectors come in the jurisdiction of provincial governments so the provincial government should address the concerns of students instantly.

“Students of these medical colleges of Balochistan have passed the entry test conducted by credible institutions. That is why, there is no justified reason for giving another special exam,” they added.

https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/323421,China pushes Russia’s ‘denazification’ myth to rationalize Ukraine invasion,"Many countries have roundly rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin’s argument that his attack on Ukraine is needed to achieve the “denazification” of that country. But the argument is alive and well in Chinese state-run media.

“Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned in a televised speech a few days ago that the military operation against Ukraine is aimed at protecting the people who have suffered abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years. For this reason, Russia will seek to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine,” one article on the state-backed site Wen Wei Po read.

China is in an awkward position as Russia wages its war in Ukraine: Beijing has interests in both Russia and with the West, so it has refrained from antagonizing Putin while also not openly supporting him. The New York Times reported that, behind the scenes, Chinese officials had asked Putin to delay his planned invasion until after the Beijing Olympics. Publicly, Chinese officials have said that China respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

This week, China was one of 35 countries to abstain from a United Nations vote to condemn Russia — placing it well outside the mainstream, but also not in the tiny minority of nations to side with Russia and oppose the resolution.

Chinese media offers another clue about where the government stands on the war Putin started, and on his reasons for starting it. (Chinese news media is subject to heavy government censorship and can be understood as reflecting the official state position.)

Official Chinese news sites have published baseless claims in recent articles claiming that the United States trained Ukrainian neo-Nazis to destabilize Hong Kong during protests there in 2019.

“When Russian President Vladimir Putin declared military actions against Ukraine, one of his slogans was to order ‘denazification’ of Ukraine. Soon after, in China’s cyberspace, Putin’s remarks invoked the memories of many Chinese citizens,” the state-backed site Taihai Net wrote in a Feb. 28 story.

Chinese social media users have also used Russian talking points about Nazis, according to a New York Times report that said many users are “bringing up the Azov Battalion as if it represented all of Ukraine.” The ultranationalist paramilitary group has a reputation for including neo-Nazis and participating in antisemitic displays. But it numbers at most several hundred in an army of about a quarter million.

Overall, the discourse seeks to rationalize the Chinese state’s behavior in Hong Kong, widely perceived internationally as an assault on democracy, while simultaneously attacking the United States, according to an analysis by the Taiwan-based Information Operations Research Group, an organization that researches Chinese influence and media manipulation in Taiwan.

In 2019, Hong Kongers began protesting an extradition law that most saw as an overreach of China’s power into the region. The bill was eventually scrapped, but a 2020 national security law has since led to arrests of activists, closures of independent news outlets and a mass exodus from the region.

This is not the first time that Ukraine and Nazism have entered the political discourse in China. Last year, state-backed news organizations criticized the United States and Ukraine after the two countries voted against a United Nations resolution aimed at “combating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices.”

At the time, the United States argued that the resolution represented “thinly veiled attempts to legitimize Russian disinformation campaigns denigrating neighboring nations and promoting the distorted Soviet narrative of much of contemporary European history, using the cynical guise of halting Nazi glorification.”

That disinformation campaign has kicked into high gear in recent weeks, with Putin saying repeatedly that Ukraine is run by neo-Nazis and has an army filled with them.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish and lost family members to the Holocaust. “How could I be a Nazi?” he asked in an appeal to Russians on the eve of the war.

Invocation of the Holocaust in political propaganda isn’t new for China. State media has criticized other countries such as Lithuania — whose relationship with China has cooled since last year — by pointing to historical antisemitism and the Holocaust. The Chinese state has also compared 2019 protests in Hong Kong to the Holocaust and claimed responsibility for saving Jewish refugees in Shanghai during World War II. While the city did provide refuge to tens of thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe, it was at the time governed by several powers. The People’s Republic of China was not founded until 1949.",Q1

https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/russias-attacks-truth-are-frighteningly-familiar-americans-rcna18960,Russia's attacks on truth are frighteningly familiar to Americans,"Over the past two weeks, the Russian government has taken steps to eliminate any semblance of a free and fair press as it continues its brutal invasion of Ukraine.

The crackdown has been multipronged, involving laws passed through Russia’s parliament, edicts handed down by Russian government agencies and the threat of physical violence by Russian law enforcement officials.

Taken together, these steps aim to eliminate press freedoms and construct an alternate reality for people living in Russia.

Taken together, these steps aim to eliminate press freedoms and construct an alternate reality for people living in Russia. Americans observing Russia’s quick turn toward totalitarianism should take this as forewarning, because similar ideas have been floated in the United States, as well.

Time to compare and contrast.

On Friday, I reported on the Russian government’s Facebook ban, a move the Kremlin made after Facebook fact-checked posts about the invasion made by government-backed media. Roskomnadzor, the Russian agency that controls mass media, claimed without evidence that Facebook committed “26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources.”

Those bogus allegations of social media discrimination sound quite similar to claims Republicans made all throughout 2020, when former President Donald Trump and other conservative figures frequently shared misinformation that was flagged and occasionally removed from social platforms.

You won’t be surprised to learn that Trump, who’s since been banned from Twitter and Facebook, last year celebrated Nigeria's decision to ban Twitter and suggested he might pursue a similar ban if he were elected president in 2024. (Nigeria lifted its ban in January.)

In another case of censorship, Russia’s lower house of parliament passed a law last week that criminalizes journalism critical of the war, including journalists who use the word “war” to describe Russia’s assault. Laws like this employ a veil of patriotism to defend obvious censorship; Americans should be quite familiar with this tactic.

Conservative politicians across the U.S. are actively passing bills that ban teachings and trainings about America’s history of racism and gender-based discrimination, claiming such teachings are “anti-American.” As president, Trump made the same claim and brazenly attempted to brainwash Americans with a propaganda document — known as the “1776 Report” — that was meant to undermine lessons about social inequality and instill what he deemed a “patriotic education.”

We’ve also seen images of Russian police beating and arresting anti-war protesters, images that may remind you of the police brutality we’ve seen at anti-racist protests across the United States. These acts of violence have an impact on the spread of truthful information by creating a chilling effect that discourages people from condemning government misconduct.

Watching Russia’s attempts to create an alternate reality is deeply worrying. But Americans have heard our own officials praise “alternative facts” in the past

And Politico on Friday published a piece about Russia’s development of a “splinternet,” which is effectively what happens when entities branch off and create their own online spaces. Politico highlighted the Russian search engine Yandex and the social media site VK as examples of platforms that give the Kremlin more control over the spread of information.

Such endeavors sound very similar to conservative attempts at creating platforms — like Trump’s fledgling Truth Social and a host of others — that allow the spread of some false and hateful information.

All of which is to say: Watching Russia’s attempts to create an alternate reality is deeply worrying. But Americans have heard our own officials praise “alternative facts” in the past, so we should be aware that attacks on truth proliferate in our country, as well. These attacks are not inherent to social media or the internet, and we must take all steps possible to defend against them on all fronts.",Q1
https://www.rferl.org/a/tajikistan-activist-amon-fraud-charge/31741738.html,Jailed Tajik Rights Defender Izzat Amon Faces Additional Charge,"U.S. President Donald Trump said he is seeking hundreds of billions of dollars worth of rare earth resources from Ukraine in exchange for Washington's support in the war against Russia, implying that failing to do so could mean a loss of the country's sovereignty.

Trump made the comments in an interview with Fox News late on February 10 as the White House embarks on a diplomacy offensive in Europe this week just days before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

""I want to have our money secured because we’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars.... I told them I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth and they've essentially agreed to do that,"" Trump said in the interview.

He added: ""And, you know, they may make a deal, they may not make a deal, they may be Russian some day, or they may not be Russian some day, but we’re going to have all this money in there and I say we’re going to want it back.""

Trump said he will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week while his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia will go to Ukraine soon and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth meets leaders from around Europe during a trip to Poland, Belgium, and France.

Zelenskyy appeared ready to accept Trump's condition, telling The Guardian in an interview published on February 11 that he wants Ukraine to be in a position of strength when it enters peace negotiations and that U.S. companies could be at the forefront of reconstruction efforts.

“Those who are helping us to save Ukraine will [have the chance to] renovate it, with their businesses together with Ukrainian businesses. All these things we are ready to speak about in detail,” he said, adding ""Ukraine may swap territories with Russia.""

Trump did not say when the envoy, Keith Kellogg, would visit Ukraine, but CNN reported the trip would take place next week, while AFP quoted a source in the Ukrainian presidency as saying the visit would take place on February 20.





Kellogg is already expected to meet with Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference, which opens on February 14, and the Ukrainian president will meet with Vice President J. D. Vance on the sidelines of the conference, Zelenskyy spokesman Sergiy Nykyforov said.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Hegseth also are scheduled to be in Munich, while Trump said he was sending Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Ukraine this week as part of initial discussions aimed at securing U.S. access to critical minerals.

At his first press conference in Germany, Hegseth told reporters in the city of Stuttgart that he will push European allies to spend more on defense and ruled out the involvement of U.S. troops in Ukraine.

""The European continent deserves to be free from any aggression, but it ought be those in the neighborhood investing the most in that individual and collective defense,"" he said.

Trump is pushing for a swift end to the war, while Zelenskyy is calling for solid security guarantees as part of any deal with Russia.

Kyiv fears any agreement that does not include hard military commitments -- such as NATO membership or the deployment of peacekeeping troops -- will allow the Kremlin time to regroup and rearm for a fresh attack.

Over the weekend, Trump said he had spoken to Russia's Vladimir Putin but he declined to specify whether the talks took place before or after he was inaugurated on January 20.

He added that he believes there has been progress toward ending the war but declined to elaborate on what he and Putin spoke about.

The Kremlin has said it could neither confirm nor deny whether Putin and Trump had spoken, but on February 11, it appeared to seize on Trump's comments on what could happen if Kyiv doesn't agree to a deal for its resources. saying, ""a considerable part of Ukraine wants to be Russia and has already become Russia.""

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a Moscow news briefing on February 10 that demands set out by Putin last June were unchanged, including that Ukraine drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from all the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.

He also warned that relations with Washington ""are balancing on the brink of a breakup.""

""We have repeatedly said that they [Russian-U.S. relations] are on the verge of rupture,"" he said, adding the ""confrontational content"" of bilateral relations has intensified.

Concerns that Washington and Moscow may agree on a peace settlement without the involvement of Ukraine are rampant in Kyiv, which insists it be at the negotiating table no matter what.

""It's essential to understand that when we talk about the principle of 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,' we mean that decisions shouldn't be made without Ukraine's participation,"" Oleksandr Merezhko, a Ukrainian deputy and the chair of the parliamentary committee on foreign policy and interparliamentary relations, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.

""Putin doesn't want negotiations, and he wants to decide Ukraine's fate without Ukraine's participation. He hopes that the United States and Russia will agree on Ukraine's fate, and Ukraine will become part of Russia's sphere of influence.""",Q1
https://www.wibc.com/news/local-indiana/indiana-marine-killed-in-nato-exercise-on-the-arctic-circle/,Indiana Marine Killed in NATO Exercise on the Arctic Circle,"FT WAYNE, Ind.–Capt. Matthew J. Tomkiewicz, 27, was one of four Marines killed in a crash during war games on the Arctic Circle in Norway Friday night, the Pentagon confirmed Sunday.

Tomkiewicz, who had been a Marine since 2015, was assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 261, Marine Aircraft Group 26, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing from Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina, said the Department of Defense.

Tomkiewicz was an MV-22B Osprey pilot, who had earned the National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.

The Marines were killed when the Osprey craft they were in crashed. The cause of the crash is still being investigated.

“Janet and I send our sincere condolences to Captain Matthew Tomkiewicz’s family and friends, especially in the tough days ahead. We ask all Hoosiers to surround the family with love and never-ending appreciation for all Captain Tomkiewicz gave to our state and nation,” said Gov. Eric Holcomb, upon learning of the captain’s death Sunday.

Sen. Todd Young also expressed condolences.

“We mourn the loss of four Marines who tragically perished during a training exercise in Norway, including Capt. Matthew Tomkiewicz of Fort Wayne. We will never forget their sacrifice and service, and I offer my deepest condolences to their loved ones,” he said on Twitter.

The other three Marines who died are Capt. Ross A. Reynolds, 27, of Leominster, Mass.; Gunnery Sgt. James W. Speedy, 30, of Cambridge, Ohio; and Cpl. Jacob M. Moore, 24, of Catlettsburg, Ky.

https://www.ledgertranscript.com/Jonathan-Lind-indicted-on-accessory-charges-in-Chicklis-murder-44977281,Massachusetts man indicted on new charges related to Chicklis murder,"A Massachusetts man has been indicted on four additional charges regarding actions he allegedly took related to the murder and disposal of the body of Brandon Chicklis, according to court documents.

Jonathan Lind, 26, was indicted by a grand jury in Worcester County Jan. 27 on charges of accessory after the fact to murder, conveying a human body, misleading a grand jury and perjury, according to Worcester Superior Court documents. He had been charged in 2021 for accessory after the fact and disinterring a body, related to the same case.

Lind is accused of assisting his then-girlfriend, Julia Enright, 24, of disposing of Chicklis’ body after she had stabbed him to death.

Under Massachusetts law, to be an accessory after the fact, a person must “maintain or assist” a person who has committed a felony, or offer aid, knowing the person has committed a felony, with intent to help them avoid detention or arrest. It is punishable by up to 2 1/2 to seven years in jail, or a fine of $1,000.

Lind did not testify in the Enright’s trial, but perjury can be done in any proceedings before or ancillary to any court or grand jury proceedings related to an indictment or complaint related to a violent crime, while under oath, according to the Massachusetts law. Perjury in non-capital cases can be punished by 20 years in state prison, or 2 1/2 years in jail or $1,000.

Enright, 24, of Ashburnham, Mass., was convicted of second-degree murder for stabbing Chicklis, a 20-year-old former classmate and ex-boyfriend, to death in a treehouse in Worcester on June 23, 2018. Lind is accused of assisting Enright in transporting Chicklis’s body from Massachusetts to Rindge and helping dispose his body in the woods off the side of Route 119 in Rindge.

During her trial, according to published reports, Enright admitted to stabbing Chicklis, but alleged it was in self-defense after he attempted to sexually assault her. Prosecutors argued Enright had lured Chicklis into hanging out that day specifically to murder him, and had written in journal entries that she had a fascination with death and murder, and had killed Chicklis as a “gift” for Lind.

Enright testified that after stabbing Chicklis, she called Lind, and they went to the treehouse together, and wrapped his body in a blanket and trash bags, and drove to New Hampshire to dispose of his body.

Lind is scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges on Feb. 15 at the Worcester Superior Court. Enright is scheduled to be sentenced on her second-degree murder conviction on March 4.

https://www.fox7austin.com/news/austin-city-council-votes-to-change-confederate-street-name-to-a-black-educator,Confederate Street in Austin to be renamed after Black educator,"Cheyenne Weaver grew up in Austin. After living in the north part of town for a while, she moved right back into the area close to downtown. However, she feels a street near her home, Confederate Street, is not reflective of the community's values in 2022.



""I was aghast that that was something that still existed. I don't want to be a part of a community that wants to honor the confederacy,"" she said.



Weaver started a petition that garnered a lot of support from her neighbors. It even caught the eye of Austin City Council member Kathie Tovo.



""We've heard lots of support for this renaming, including from one resident who lives on the street and is eager to have a name that's more reflective of both the Black community that lived and founded and thrived in Clarksville as well as more reflective of the diversity of our city,"" said Tovo.



Council approved a resolution Thursday to initiate the renaming process. The name to replace Confederate will be Maggie Mayes, an African-American educator living in the freedman community of Clarksville, located in modern day West Austin.



""She was somebody who lived in Clarksville, she was a leader citywide but worked in Clarksville. She started the first school in Clarksville,"" said Tovo.

""They haven't given up and accepted they lost the Civil War. They are still fighting the civil war here, and it's time we put that behind,"" said Sabino Renteria, Austin City Council, District Three.

Weaver believes learning our history is important, but context as well. She believes the confederacy should be remembered, but not honored.

""Words really matter. Words have a power to them, to convey values and to convey who we are as a community,"" she said.

The city council will finalize the measure at an upcoming council meeting, before making the change officially.

“In a word, you need to be the freedom generation and I know you will. But to do that you need to prepare your minds for action,” said Pence at an event held at Dinkelspiel Auditorium, titled “How to Save America from the Woke Left.”

Pence, who served as the 48th vice president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, called on students to read closely and ruminate on the country’s founding documents.

“I think every American should reflect on the words of the preamble of the Constitution. It’s kind of our to-do list,” he said. “Our government was created to establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.”

In his roughly 30-minute remarks, Pence reflected on the influence of more contemporary national leaders as well, particularly that of Ronald Reagan, who served as U.S. president from 1981 to 1989. “I signed up for the Reagan Revolution and have never looked back,” he said. Pence described Reagan as a “great disrupter,” and said he saw parallels between the backgrounds of Reagan – “a conservative outsider who vigorously opposed a moderate Republican establishment of his day” – and former President Donald Trump.

Introducing Pence was Sarah Olmstead, ’23, president of the Stanford College Republicans. “I had the pleasure of meeting the vice president my freshman year at Stanford. As a small-town girl from rural New Mexico, speaking with Vice President Pence led me to realize that we must fight for the values of faith, freedom and family as adamantly as he does, even in unpopular settings,” Olmstead said.

‘An evening full of duality’

Pence’s visit was met with some resistance among members of the Stanford community.

Outside Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford students gathered in nearby White Plaza before the event to write protest phrases such as “Teach Ideas Not Hate” and “Stand Up 4 Love, Pence = Hate” in chalk on the ground and on cardboard signs. Leaders of the peaceful demonstration took up megaphones to lead the chanting crowd to barricades set up outside the auditorium.

Nelia Lechuga, ’25, said she protested the event “because Pence and the Pence-Trump administration have values that are against my family, that are against the reason we’re here. I do not agree with what he did with the country and the values that he so prominently displays. I’m here to speak out against that.”

Protesting is an important reminder for people to support and protect others, value each other’s identities, spread love and recognize the harm Pence and his administration has caused, she said.

Meanwhile, Rahsaan McFarland, ’25, said he attended tonight’s event for “perspective. Coming to an event like this, even if you may not agree with what Pence has to say, I feel like it’s an extremely unique opportunity for it to be held here at Stanford.”

McFarland said he hoped to learn more about “the inner workings of Pence, particularly removed from Trump – what he has to say versus more of what Trump has to say and the intersections between the two.”

“It’s an evening full of duality,” McFarland reflected. “We have this event here and we also have people protesting, which I fully support. … I feel Pence has some provocative standpoints politically and socially, so I feel like protest is warranted for an event like this given many of the comments Pence has made.”

As someone from England and Iran, with experience working in politics, Romy McCarthy, ’25, said she thought it would be politically interesting to hear Pence speak.

“I get why people are angry, but I’ve come from a foreign perspective where I just think I’m gonna learn more listening to him, even if I don’t agree with him, than sitting in my bed watching Netflix,” McCarthy said.

“You come to university to listen to other people’s perspectives,” she said, “and part of getting an education is being able to listen to someone you don’t agree with and still come out and be able to hold your own and not be swayed by that kind of thing.”

‘A tragic day’

During his speech, which was followed by a Q&A session with several students, Pence defended his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, not to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election by rejecting certified electoral college votes in the states that Trump lost.

“Let me just say, plainly, that January 6 was a tragic day,” he said, referring to the riots that took place on Capitol Hill, which disrupted the certification of the electoral vote count for President Joe Biden and forced members of the Senate and House to evacuate their chambers. “I know in my heart that we did our duty that day,” Pence said. “I knew what my duty was and I kept my oath even though it hurt. And it moved the nation forward.”

He said he and Trump may never see eye to eye on this matter.

Pence also spoke out against Biden’s decision to fully withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, linking it to other crises around the world. “You know, history teaches that weakness arouses evil,” he said. “President Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has only emboldened our adversaries. As we stand here tonight, the world awaits. Russian tanks and 130,000 soldiers are arrayed on the border of Ukraine. Iran is accelerating its nuclear program. China continues to tie international cooperation to demands that the world look the other way on human rights on Taiwan, Hong Kong and their aggressive military maneuvers.”

On the topic of the pandemic, Pence touted his leading role in Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort aimed at accelerating the development of the first vaccines against COVID-19. But he criticized the Biden administration’s decision to mandate vaccines for millions of Americans through their employers, a move that was later blocked by the Supreme Court.

“I believe Operation Warp Speed was a medical miracle. We developed three safe and effective vaccines in nine months when experts usually take years to develop those medicines. And I’ve gotten the vaccine myself, got the booster myself,” Pence said. “But I gotta tell you, in a free society, that’s a choice every American should be able to make for themselves and their family.”

Calls for freedom

Pence said he views the idea of being “woke” – a term used to describe awareness of injustice in society, particularly racism – as a “troubling development” and sees its embrace as an assault on free speech.

“Every single day, you see new efforts to silence or cancel those who disagree with a progressive agenda,” said Pence. “So my challenge to each one of you is let the Constitution and the Declaration be your guide.”

Pence also took issue with critical race theory, a research methodology that emerged from legal scholarship more than four decades ago to better understand how race is embedded in American legal systems, and also “cancel culture,” which he views as shutting people out of public debate.

To counter these trends, Pence said the “antidote is freedom.” “To promote the general welfare doesn’t require growing government – it also means understanding where the general welfare arrives from in a free society,” Pence said. “Promoting freedom and free enterprise is also about promoting the general welfare.”

Freedom is also about holding free and fair elections, Pence said, a point he emphasized during the question and answer session with the audience.

“I really believe in a free and open and vigorous public debate. And I believe in elections, and having elections with integrity that can move forward, let people decide and then people will decide – whether it’s in the primary or the general election – the direction of the party.”

Pence closed by urging students to consider serving their country, if not in uniform then in public office at a local, state or federal level. “Use this time in your life to develop the qualities of the inner man and the inner woman that will make you into the leaders our nation will need and rely on in the days ahead,” he said. “People follow people that they trust. So develop a vision. Draw that vision from the American founding, and learn how to put it in your own words for your neighbors and your friends.”",Q1

The settlement, which is due to be approved Wednesday by the city’s Board of Estimates, would close out a lawsuit filed by the family of Malcolm J. Bryant. Bryant was convicted of killing 16-year-old Toni Bullock in 1998. His sentence was vacated in 2016 with the help of the Maryland Innocence Project after a court-ordered DNA test on the victim’s nail clippings revealed a partial DNA profile that did not match Bryant.

Bryant was released from prison in 2016 and died in early 2017 at age 42.

Bryant’s family sued the Baltimore Police Department as well as Detective William F. Ritz and forensic analyst Barry Verger in 2019 arguing their failure to disclose exculpatory evidence led to Bryant’s wrongful conviction.

The city law department’s settlement committee has recommended settling the case, according to the Board of Estimates agenda for Wednesday. An attorney for Bryant’s family was not available for comment.

In their lawsuit, the Bryant estate argued Ritz failed to disclose knowledge of another eyewitness whose account contradicted and undermined testimony from the only eyewitness to Bullock’s death used at trial. Ritz also allegedly failed to disclose multiple pieces of evidence pointing to another possible suspect in the case.

The suit states Verger allegedly failed to examine the fingernail clippings for DNA and falsely reported the fingernails were consumed, meaning no further testing was possible.

Bullock, an 11th-grader at Carver Vocational-Technical High School who aspired to be an accountant, was walking home from a drugstore with her best friend on Nov. 20, 1998, when a man dragged her into a vacant lot and stabbed her multiple times.

Police released a composite sketch, and presented Bullock’s friend with a photo lineup that included Bryant. The friend picked him out as the killer.

Bryant produced alibi witnesses, but he was convicted of murder by a city jury the following year. While in prison, Bryant maintained his innocence, and won numerous court orders to test evidence related to the case.

In 2011, a court-ordered DNA test on Bullock’s nail clippings revealed a partial DNA profile that included a rare identifier that did not match Bryant. Attorneys with the Innocence Project later obtained a court order to test a T-shirt that was worn by Bullock, which revealed a full DNA profile that matched the partial profile from the nail clippings.

With the lab results in hand, prosecutors re-interviewed witnesses, visited the crime scene, and talked to Bryant’s alibi witnesses.

“The only plausible reason … is that the DNA is in fact that of the killer,” State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said in 2016. “And the DNA does not match that of Malcolm Bryant, which in all probability means he is not the killer.”

The lawsuit, brought by Bryant’s sons, Lamar Estep and Malique Bryant, sought unspecified damages, compensation for attorneys fees and punitive damages against each defendant.

The settlement is one of the largest finalized by Baltimore in recent years related to conduct of the Baltimore Police Department. In 2020, the city paid out nearly $8 million to Umar Burley and Brent Matthews who were both sent to federal prison for drugs planted in their vehicle in 2010 by the department’s disgraced Gun Trace Task Force.",Q1

From the West Alabama Newsroom–

Two Selma men are behinds bars — and authorities are looking for a third — after breaking up a theft and drug ring in Dallas County.

Sheriff Mike Granthum says 29 year old Tyler Smith — and 33 year old Herman Olds — are each facing theft and drug charges.

He says deputies made traffic stop on an ATV traveling on Highway 219 last week.

Several gram of marijuana and Methamphetamine were found on the driver. And a check of the vehicle found it had been reported stolen.

Two more stolen four wheelers — guns — and more drugs — were found during a search of the suspect’s home.

“We think it’s a ring, we don’t think they’re working by themselves. So were working, we got our boots on the ground and we’re working hard. And we’re going to get some of this property back and put the people in jail that’s responsible for it.”

Granthum says 47 year old Jeffrey Seymour of Selma — is also wanted in connection to the case. And more arrests are possible.",Q1

""The procedural defect and irregularity might have been done by the Investigation Officer (IO) during investigation to give undue favour to the accused and the police authority at the most may take action in this regard. The police authority must think over it to take positive steps for reforms in the investigation wing of police department,"" a 61-page judgment said.

Renowned lawyer Salman Safdar, who has expertise in criminal law, lauded the trial court to give speedy and bold judgment in the case. He said evidences were collected more professionally as compared with other cases of same nature. He maintained that acquittal of accused’s parents was a courageous decision when superior courts had already rejected the father’s bail.

The trial court in its judgment noted that many technical objections were raised on part of the defence, adding that technical aspects regarding defective investigation had no value in light of the modern device and scientific evidence. ""The police witnesses made some contradictory statements regarding the time of arrival of the police officials and complainant at the place of occurrence.

It is submitted that the oral statement has no value in light of documentary evidence in shape of P-13 and P14. The CCTV footage P-13 and P-14 made clear all the contradiction pointed out by learned defence counsel. The defence side also pointed the loopholes and lacunas in the investigation.

“The court observed that the IO committed mistakes and left loopholes during investigation. The IO got drafted the recovery memos through his colleagues or subordinates without giving reason. The question arises that whether the defective investigation is enough to spoil the case of prosecution/complainant,” the judgment said.

In this regard, the judgment noted that the Supreme Court in judgment cited as 2008 SCMR 1228 held that discrepancy reflected on the working and lethargy of the IO could not cause any harm to the prosecution’s case. “In the said case, the IO did not take into possession the blood stained clothes of the deceased, blood stained cloth, empties from the place of occurrence. Similarly, the Hon’ble High court in judgment cited as 1998 P.Cr.L.J 114 held that procedural defect or irregularity or even illegality in course of investigation shall not demolish the case of – prosecution.”

The court noted that the discrepancies and contradiction as pointed out by defence side were not material and such contradiction and discrepancies were not fatal to case of complainant.

However, the judgment said that the prosecution had produced its sufficient evidence in shape of modern scientific and forensic evidence to establish its case that Noor was killed by accused Zahir Zakir Jaffer inside his room.

""The dead body was recovered from the room of accused Zahir Zakir. Even the accused (the members of Therapy Team) had seen the dead body lying in the said room. The defence side has failed to rebut the evidence of prosecution. “The defence also failed to establish that the dead body was not recovered from the said room of accused Zahir Zakir or the deceased Mst Noor Muqadam was done to death at somewhere else. According to the reports of PFSA Ex P-BM relating to Forensic toxicology, drugs/ poison were not detected in the liver and stomach contents of deceased sent to the laboratory and as per PFSA report Ex P-BL the DNA profile of the accused is also matched and accused Zahir Zakir cannot be excluded being contributor to DNA mixture profile.

“As per statements of PW-4 and PW-7 the sealed parcels were kept in save custody and transmitted to concern authority/laboratory. The medical evidence also supports the prosecution version as the cause of death is lack of blood supply to the brain due to separation from head from the body. The defence evidence as well as point raised by defence side has no weightage in front of the heavy flow of the prosecution evidence,” the judgment",Q1
https://www.reckonsouth.com/trans-folks-in-alabama-very-much-still-exist-are-still-valid-and-are-the-future-of-our-state/,"‘Trans folks in Alabama very much still exist, are still valid and are the future of our state’","Quentin Bell, executive director of The Knights and Orchids Society, a nonprofit organization based in Selma, Alabama.

The trans community in Alabama is facing one of the most harmful sessions in recent times, with a bill aimed at preventing transgender kids from living their authentic lives, from accessing medical care, and trying to prevent them from just being who they are. There’s no doubt these bills have kept me up at night, prompted emergency calls from young people, and sparked crisis management sessions with parents of trans kids. I work every day to ensure that transgender youth in Alabama can be their whole selves and live freely. And regardless the outcome of these legislative attacks on trans youth, such as SB184, trans folks in Alabama very much still exist, are still valid, and are the future of our state. Their potential is what gives me hope.

I work for an organization called The Knights and Orchids Society (TKO) a service organization that helps queer folks, trans folks and anyone in need, find access to life- saving resources and medical care. I began this work over a decade ago because as a born and raised Alabamian I struggled to find support, resources, and community when I myself came out as a transgender man. I started TKO so that no trans young person would have to live through what I did: lack of stable housing, food, medical care, and most of all, community.

Today’s legislative attacks on transgender people make me think of Zuriel, a trans young adult I met near the beginning of the pandemic . After calling all over the state for resources – medical information, transition support, community, anything really – she was referred to TKO and the community in Selma. When Zuriel came to us, she was full to the brim with a thirst for change and connection. Zuriel came out as trans in Montgomery at the age of 19. Unfortunately, she was not received with open arms by either her chosen family, community, or school. She arrived to us having survived bullying, isolation, and many more forms of violence before even considering a medical transition. And while we are proud to have connected Zuriel with housing, transition support, and other resources, the joy I now see in her – two years later – is the brightness that gives me hope for our collective future as trans people.

I recently asked Zuriel, “What do you hope for in the future – our future?” And she replied, “I have been living the light of the community. I feel like me and that feels amazing. I feel a sense of hope that we will all feel this way. I have something to live for and I am looking forward to what’s next, for me and for our whole community – I know this is just the beginning.” She is confident that her generation will find wholeness and joy, regardless of external forces. Her certain optimism gives me a new sense of hope.

Zuriel Hooks is a peer navigator for The Knights and Orchids Society and a young trans activist fighting at the intersections of trans visibility and healthcare access.

I could have been born anywhere in the world, the universe saw fit for me to be born right here in Selma, Alabama; Selma – a town that was ground zero for the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Yet, in light of recent attacks on my own marginalized community, I worry that legacy has been dulled. Black and trans youth in Alabama, like Zuriel, seek access to the same treatment as anyone else – that desire for equity and equality is the same pillar that became the backbone of the black civil rights leaders in this very state. But the fight for trans rights does not always receive the same attention or support as other struggles for civil rights.

Despite all of this, Alabama will always be home. I live here because I hope to honor its legacy of civil rights and equality – one that some are quick to forget. My work is my calling, so I do it regardless of any law or policy, and that will never change. Likewise, trans young people in Alabama will continue to answer their calling of authenticity and truth–regardless of any law. The next generation of transgender people won’t have to start from scratch–we already know that to be true. Trans youth are too resilient and they will have the futures they have dream of. I am comforted knowing that like our ancestors here in Selma, if we can endure the present moment in the midst of the storm, imagine how good the future for trans people will be.

As we look forward, I know our youth will never forget those who pushed these harmful laws–those that did not want them to thrive. Young folks like Zuri are busy taking care of one another – with or without our help. They are fostering love, collective growth, and mutual support to the most marginalized. Our young people will be the ones that are going to take care of us all in the future. And while the scars of history may heal, even as we continue to do the work of community support and empowerment, those scars will not soon be forgotten.

Besides, they also vowed to continue their struggle against the injustices with the province’s residents. A large number of workers belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), three major political parties who are part of opposition in Sindh Assembly and coalition government in the centre, attended the protest that was held at Fawara Chowk.

Carrying placards, party flags and chanting slogans against what they termed a “black law”, the workers demanded from PPP’s provincial government to revoke the disputed local government bill and empower the municipal committees to resolve their civic issues..

Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, MQM-P’s convenor, while addressing the protestors, said people from all ethnicities living in the city have attended the protest which shows zero confidence in the biased provincial government of PPP.

“Right now, an anti-government march is awaiting and Saturday's protest is just a notice to the Sindh government,” said Siddqui, adding, “Sindh Chief Minister House is not far away from Fawara Chowk. If the protests start marching towards it, they can vacate the Sindh CM House too.”

PTI Sindh president and federal minister Ali Zaidi said that the joint opposition in Sindh had organised an impressive power show and Karachi’s residents gave their verdict against the local government law and the PPP-led provincial government.

MQM-P’s senior deputy convener Amir Khan said the protest against the PPP-led government will begin from city’s main artery Sharea Faisal near Metropole Hotel.

Khan also announced that they would not go back till the provincial government repealed the local government law, adding, “The feudal style of governance of PPP in Sindh is causing a great deal of unrest among the people and giving them the feeling of alienation,” he said.

Opposition leader in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh said that their protest campaign was against the “corrupt rulers” of Sindh that had passed the controversial law through the backdoor.

GDA’s MPA Nusrat Sehar Abbasi said that the disputed local government legislation must be abolished because it aimed at making people from Karachi to Kashmore powerless.

GDA’s MPA Hasnain Mirza and Sardar Abdul Rahim, MQM-P’s Khwaja Izharul Hasan, PTI MPA Khurram Sherzaman and other leaders also spoke to the protest rally and said that all the major parties of the province were in agreement that the Sindh government had snatched the rights of the people through the amended local government law.",Q1

https://www.ktvq.com/news/local-news/broadus-family-coping-with-loss-of-children-for-2nd-time,Broadus family coping with loss of children for 2nd time,"BROADUS — Monday was the first day back at school for Broadus students since classmates Cale and Caty Emmons died last week in an accident on Highway 212 west of town.

Thursday morning, 15-year-old Cale was driving Caty, 13, and their other two sisters to school in an older model Chevrolet Camaro. According to the Montana Highway Patrol, Cale moved over to the westbound lane to pass a flatbed truck and collided with an oncoming semi. He was pronounced dead shortly after. Caty was flown to Salt Lake City but succumbed to life-threatening injuries Friday.

The other two sisters, Caty’s twin Kensi and 11-year-old Karlee, survived the crash, and mom Kimber told Q2 their memory of the event is different from the highway patrol's narrative, though she did not elaborate exactly how. There is an active investigation in progress.

This isn’t the first tragedy Kimber and Brett Emmons have gone through. They lost 8-year-old daughter Kenna to an extremely rare illness on March 13, 2011 - almost 11 years ago to the day of the accident. Doctors told the Emmonses not to have any more biological children, so in 2015, they adopted Caty, Kensi, and Karlee.

Now, just Kensi, Karlee and the Emmons’ oldest son Malachi are left to carry on.

“No mom, no dad, no family should ever have to bury three children,"" Kimber said in a statement. ""It’s beyond comprehension. We are broken. We are empty. We are lost.”

But they are not alone, as evidenced by the hundreds of messages they’ve received. Funeral services for Caty and Cale are set for April 1 at 11 a.m. in the Broadus High School gym.",Q1
https://jewishjournal.com/community/343821/beverly-hills-city-council-unanimously-passes-resolution-supporting-recall-of-la-district-attorney/,Beverly Hills City Council Unanimously Passes Resolution Supporting Recall of LA District Attorney,"The Beverly Hills City Council unanimously passed a resolution on January 4 endorsing the recall of Los Angeles District Attorney (DA) George Gascon.

According to a press release from the City of Beverly Hills, the resolution was brought at the request of Beverly Hills Mayor Bob Wunderlich and Vice Mayor Lili Bosse. “Over the last 12 months, Los Angeles County has seen a dramatic increase in widespread crime including follow-home robberies, smash-and-grab incidents and the tragic death of beloved Beverly Hills philanthropist Jacqueline Avant,” the press release stated.

Avant, the 81-year-old wife of music executive Clarence Avant, was shot and killed during a home invasion on December 1; the suspect, 29-year-old Aariel Maynor, has been charged in the killing of Avant. Beverly Hills Chief of Police Mark Stainbrook was quoted as saying: “We’re arresting the same people again and again and letting them right out to commit more crime. So, if you look at Mrs. Avant’s case, that individual has a lengthy criminal history. He was out on parole and he was out committing crime. He should never have ever been out in the first place.”

The “smash-and-grab” incidents are referencing a ring of burglars targeting stores and looting them; nearly a dozen such incidents have occurred in the county since November. Fourteen people have been arrested in connection to them, but they all have since been released from custody as a result of “their age, after posting bail or because of no-bail rules,” according to NBC Los Angeles.

The city council then cited specific policies implemented by Gascon that concern them, including the elimination of cash bail for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, dismissing misdemeanor charges (albeit some exceptions) and revoking sentence enhancements in circumstances involving bail violations and gang affiliations, among others.

The DA’s office did not respond to the Journal’s request for comment.

The effort to recall Gascon initially sputtered but a new campaign was launched on December 6. One of the leaders of the recall efforts is former Los Angeles DA Steve Cooley; County Sheriff Alex Villanueva was a supporter for the first recall campaign and has been a vocal critic of Gascon. Jon Hatami, a deputy district attorney under Gascon, has also criticized the DA, telling ABC7 that “releasing criminals, not charging crime does not work in Los Angeles.” Thirty-one city councils in the county have issued votes of no confidence against Gascon. The recall will need 579,000 signatures in order to force an election to replace Gascon, according to CBS Los Angeles.

A December 9 KTLA report stated that recent crime statistics “paint a complicated picture of Gascón’s policies,” noting that while “homicides are up 46% and car thefts are up 53% in Los Angeles compared with the same time frame through Nov. 27 of 2019 … Property crime however is down 6.6%, robberies are down 13.6%, and burglaries are down 7.7%, in the same time frames.” Gascon’s policies mainly affect property crimes, KTLA report stated, citing The Los Angeles Times.

Gascon has defended his policies, arguing that many cases don’t reach his office before the suspects are released, and “that we go through these cycles, and we go through the cycles for a variety of reasons … In many ways we cannot prosecute our way out of social inequalities, income inequalities, the unhoused, the desperation that we have,” per ABC7 and KTLA.

In an official rebuttal to the recall campaign, Gascon accused the recall of being a “right-wing” effort to oust him from office. “This is not about keeping Angelenos safe, it’s about a political power grab by well-funded political operatives who have fought reforms—on juvenile detention, mental health treatment, police accountability in fatal police shootings, and the death penalty—for decades,” he said, per The Washington Examiner, adding that “Los Angeles needs to move forward as a safer and less divided community where we focus on preventing crime to keep people safe—not react with political fearmongering or cable news ratings grabs.”",Q1

But much about the incident remains unknown because authorities have so far not shared any evidence about what happened.

Jajuan Henderson, of Burlington, was shot four times just after midnight Feb. 12 outside of his girlfriend's residence. He is now partially paralyzed and remains hospitalized.

Attorney David Bahuriak, of the Bahuriak Law Group in Philadelphia, said during a news conference at NAACP headquarters in Trenton that his client was retrieving some iced tea from his parked car when another unmarked vehicle suddenly pulled up next to him, and four men wearing masks and dark civilian clothing jumped out, surrounded the car and demanded Henderson open the car.

Seconds later, the men, who turned out to be police officers, fired four shots into the car.

Why was he shot?

“How do you wind up shooting an unarmed Black man in the neck, in the back, paralyzing him, nearly killing him, leaving his family to wonder whether he’s dead or alive,” he said.

Gia Henderson. David Matthau, Townsquare Media NJ Gia Henderson. David Matthau, Townsquare Media NJ loading...

The injured man’s mother, Gia Henderson, said when she found out her son had been shot multiple times and was paralyzed “my heart almost broke and I was devastated. I thought Jajuan was going to die absolutely for no reason at all.”

A call for justice

She said the officers involved in the shooting have to be held responsible.

“There is no justice as long as those officers get to continue to live their lives when my son lies paralyzed, and my family just needs change, transparency and accountability,” she said.

According to court records, Henderson had done time in 2013 on drug and resisting arrest charges and again in 2016 after pleading guilty to child endangerment in a sex assault indictment involving a victim under 16.

But Bahuriak said his client in this instance was an innocent victim who did nothing wrong and was not wanted by police.

Authorities allege the incident took place after a traffic stop. Henderson has been charged with obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, but four counts of aggravated assault have now been dropped.

“This was an unarmed man sitting in a parked car when he was approached by law enforcement officers. We don’t have any reason to believe they even knew who Mr. Henderson was. This should have been a really routine interaction which ended up in a shooting,"" he said.

“We need to get back to the mission of protecting and serving and away from this mission of intimidating and terrorizing the community. This community has had enough and they want answers.”

Was it the Jump Out Boys?

Civil rights attorney Gregg Zeff said he believes the officers involved in the incident were members of the Jump Out Boys.

He said the Jump Out Boys are a group of officers that throughout New Jersey “ride around in unmarked vehicles, some of them include state troopers on assignment, some of them include FBI agents on assignment, looking for crime in high crime areas. They are always in plain clothes, they are always in unmarked cars with tinted windows.”

“When the Jump Out Boys are seen, everybody runs in the opposite direction. They have been known throughout this state to be involved in more violent incidents than regular police officers on the street.”

He said the civil rights lawsuit filed on behalf of Henderson is for an unspecified amount, but in these types of cases “typically we’re talking about a lot of money.”

Bahuriak said dangerous and unjustified behavior by police in minority neighborhoods continues to take place.

“You have grandmothers teaching their kids to be afraid, you have those kids teaching their kids to be afraid, afraid of the police who are meant to be serving them. This paradigm needs to change.”

The Union County Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the incident after a conflict of interest was identified within the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office.

Union County Assistant Prosecutor Michael Sheets declined to comment on the incident or the ongoing investigation.

Researchers have been able to greatly reduce cysts caused by a rare genetic lung disease using tiny lipid-based nanoparticles in a mouse model.

The new work involves tiny lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) fine-tuned to latch on to specific tissues, organs, and even cell types within the body. The researchers have created LNPs that carry genetic instructions directly into the lungs.

Even if you haven’t heard of LNPs before, you may have already had an injection with them recently—LNP delivery had its first blockbuster debut in the two mRNA-based major COVID-19 vaccines.

The researchers have taken the existing LNP technology and engineered it to be applicable to a much broader range of diseases by targeting it to specific tissues and organs, which helps minimize toxic effects on other, healthy parts of the body.

Delivering drugs with nanoparticles

The team, led by Qiaobing Xu, a professor of biomedical engineering at Tufts University, packed the LNPs with mRNA—the same genetic material used in two COVID-19 vaccines—but this time coding for a normal gene, Tsc2, that is mutated in individuals with a rare disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).

The mutated Tsc2 causes smooth muscle tissue to grow out of control, creating cysts that look like large gaps or holes in the lungs on an X-ray or CT scan. In a mouse model of LAM, delivering a normal Tsc2 gene directly to the lungs led to a significant reduction in cysts.

“The effect was quite impressive,” says Xu, who worked with collaborators from Harvard Medical School and the University of Massachusetts, Boston. “The mRNA-packed LNPs could be a promising intervention for this awful disease, and we hope to carry it further into clinical trials.”

The research follows on earlier work, in which Xu and his team created LNPs that carry gene-editing packages into cells of the immune system, the liver, or even across the blood brain barrier to specific regions of the brain.

The current study does not involve gene editing, which splices out a bad gene and replaces it with a good one. In this case, it’s more like overwriting the bad gene that’s still there with a temporary code (the mRNA) that fades over time, requiring repeat doses. The researchers wondered if it would be possible to try a more lasting gene editing approach to LAM.

“We were able to demonstrate that we could deliver gene editing to the lungs, but it showed up in the liver as well,” says co-first author Min Qiu, a former postdoctoral researcher in the Xu group at Tufts and now a principal investigator at Fudan University in China.

“The size and components of the gene-editing kit may have affected the LNPs’ ability to selectively target the lungs in this case,” he says. “Delivering the smaller mRNA package is a lot more selective.” The team is currently working on refining the LNPs to enable more targeted gene editing to the lungs.

Tiny bubbles of fat

The LNPs are essentially tiny bubbles of fat (lipid) and other molecules. Like the mRNA, the LNPs were also used in two of the major vaccines approved for protection against COVID-19. The twist added by the researchers to get the LNPs to home in on a specific organ like the lungs comes from how they modify the lipids and other molecules making up the tiny bubbles.

The bubbles are formed with a bilayer of lipids, which encircle the contents. Every lipid can be described as having chemical parts. There’s a head that points to a watery environment—either to the outside, or the inside of the bubble where the mRNA or gene-editing kit is packed; a tail that points to the middle of the bilayer; and a linker between the two. Changing any of those parts can change where the LNPs might end up in the body.

By testing many combinations of heads, tails, and linkers, as well as other components of the LNPs such as cholesterol or polyethylene glycol, the researchers have been able to target not only the brain or immune system, but also the spleen, liver, and even specific cell types.

The two leading lung-targeting LNPs both had linkers containing a nitrogen atom, which seemed to be key for targeting to the lungs.

“We found out that the molecules making up the LNPs would pick up proteins and other molecules from the plasma, and it is that ‘crown’ of material that interacts with the target tissue, organ or cell,” says Xu.

By analyzing which plasma proteins stuck to the LNPs, the researchers narrowed down to fourteen proteins as possibly having a role in helping them to stick to and absorb into the lungs, including ApoE, albumin, fibrinogen beta, and fibrinogen gamma.

“It does become a trial and error process to find the right targeting combination, but we can definitely find that combination within a time frame needed for discovering treatments of a wide range of diseases.”

The research appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

On Dec. 6, 2023, he was was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Our earlier story is below.

[This story previously aired on Feb. 12, 2022. It was updated on Sept 3.]

More than two-and-a-half years ago, prominent Hollywood therapist Amie Harwick was found fatally injured beneath her bedroom balcony just hours after Valentine's Day -- a former boyfriend has been charged with her death. In his first extensive TV interview, Drew Carey, host of CBS' ""The Price Is Right"" and Harwick's onetime fiancé, offers ""48 Hours"" correspondent Erin Moriarty a raw, honest account of unexpected love and unbearable loss.

In the early morning hours of Feb. 15, 2020, police found Amie Harwick, a high-profile family therapist, clinging to life beneath the balcony outside her home.

As Amie was rushed to the hospital, investigators immediately questioned her traumatized roommate who had called 911. They set out to interview neighbors and look for surveillance camera video - anything to explain what had happened to her.

Hours earlier, Amie's Valentine's Day had started peacefully with a sunrise hike with her friend, Cleopatra Slough.

Cleopatra Slough: So, I got to her house ... She invited me in because she still hadn't gotten ready yet. ... We went up to her bedroom, which was very beautiful. It had this nice balcony, all this natural light. ...And she was frantically getting ready and at the last minute, she grabbed this little red cardigan sweater and said,"" it's Valentine's Day, I am just going to throw this on.""

Amie acted as a local tour guide as they climbed the winding Hollywood Hills streets.

Cleopatra Slough: She was pointing out all these different landmarks she liked, telling me different history about the neighborhood.

They stopped for breakfast at the Beachwood Café.

Cleopatra Slough: She talked a lot about how happy she was. How ... she felt really accomplished and happy with where she was in life and very much, like, at peace ...

Erin Moriarty: Did she seem worried about anything that day?

Cleopatra Slough: No.

Erin Moriarty: Did she talk about what her plans were that night?

Cleopatra Slough: Yes. ... They were all going to a burlesque show. And she was really excited to get dressed up and go to that.

Erin Moriarty: What was she wearing that night?

Miss Tosh: She was wearing her rosary necklace, her leather jacket, her purse and her boots and a velvet dress.

The necklace would later become a key piece of evidence.

Amie's friend, known as Miss Tosh, says the burlesque show started around 7 p.m.

Miss Tosh: They brought a little Kodak camera and taking all these film photos together ... And I could see them even when I was on stage just, like, cheering and standing. The best time.

Around the time that Amie and her friends were taking pictures at the show, Amie's roommate Michael Herman - asleep in his room on the first floor - would later tell authorities he thought he heard the sound of a smashing plate. He thought it was Amie, a floor above, and drifted back to sleep. Investigators now believe it was an intruder breaking the glass of the French door to her home.

Erin Moriarty [looking at photo]: In this moment, everybody, you know, looks happy.

Miss Tosh: We're all on a high of thrill of celebrating the show ... we were just having so much fun.

Amie, still at the Globe Theater, caught up with Miss Tosh in the lobby after the show around 9 p.m. Miss Tosh asked her to come to the after party.

Miss Tosh: And she's like, ""no, I'm just going to have tea with my friends"" ... and that was my last moment with her was just, you know,"" I love you. I'll see you again soon.""

Amie and her friends left the Globe Theatre and they ended up at the Nomad until 12:18 a.m.

At around 1 a.m., Amie pulled into her driveway, and she texted her friend Sara Rollins to send pictures from the Nomad: ""Send me pics on the green couch!"" The time is 1:02 a.m.

Moments later, police believe she climbed the stairs to her third-floor bedroom and was viciously attacked. Police theorize that Amie's assailant had been lying in wait for four hours.

Amie's roommate was jolted out of sleep by her screams. He later testified that he heard the sound of bodies falling to the floor and more screams that seemed muffled, as though someone had put a hand over her mouth.

Unable to find his phone, Amie's roommate first just tries yelling to scare the assailant away. When he runs for help, he gets trapped inside the courtyard, and has to scale a tall metal fence, cutting himself, but he still makes it over to the neighbor, knocking repeatedly, and nobody comes to the door.

It was now 1:08 a.m., Amie's roommate is frantic. He then runs across the street and again no one answers the door. Then, he sees someone walking up the street who happens to have a phone. They call for help. It is now 1:14 a.m.

In the early morning hours of February 15, 2020, police found Amie Harwick clinging to life beneath the balcony outside of her Hollywood Hills home. Police noted that Amie had severe injuries and deep marks on her neck, signs that she had been strangled before she fell from the balcony. Robert Coshland

That's when police found Amie lying 20 feet below her bedroom balcony. She was struggling to breathe.

Police noted that Amie had severe injuries and deep marks on her neck - signs that she had been strangled before she fell from the balcony.

At 2:05 a.m., Sara Rollins, who had no idea Amie was clinging to life, texted that photo of her on the green couch. But, by then, Amie was on her way to Cedar Sinai Medical Center. She died at 3:26 a.m.

Inside her home investigators discovered evidence of a violent struggle. There was blood on a bedroom door. There was also a trail of those rosary beads that she'd been wearing earlier that night that went from her TV room, through her bedroom and onto the balcony. And that's where they recovered a syringe filled with liquid.

Considering Amie did not smoke, drink or do drugs, the syringe seemed out of place. Was it left by Amie's attacker? And why?



LOVE AND LOSS

As dawn broke over Los Angeles on the morning after Valentine's Day in 2020, hearts began breaking.

Robert Coshland: It's like the sun was ripped from the sky.

Amie Harwick's close friends Cleopatra Slough, Grace Stanley and Robert Coshland, were hearing the news that the 38-year-old woman they'd loved and leaned on was gone.

Cleopatra Slough (cries): I didn't believe it.

Grace Stanley (cries): She's not there anymore.

Robert Coshland: The police called me...and said, ""Hey can you come down to the Hollywood station.""

In 2018, on a special Valentine's episode of ""The Price Is Right,"" host Drew Carey introduced Amie Harwick to the world as his fiancée. ""I fell so hard for her,"" Carey says. ""She was really smart."" Eddy Chen/CBS

Word quickly reached her onetime fiancé, too: Drew Carey, comedian and host of ""The Price is Right"" on CBS. He introduced Amie to the world on the Valentine's Day edition of the show in 2018, just two years before her death.

Drew Carey: You want an intimate relationship where you can open up to somebody completely ... and she was that for me.

Carey is giving his first extensive television interview about Amie Harwick: A raw, honest account of unexpected love and unbearable loss.

Erin Moriarty: How'd you meet her?

Drew Carey: I ... met her at - there's this producer that would throw these like, amazing big Hollywood parties.

It was 2017. He says he saw stars all over the room that night, but especially when he saw Amie Harwick, who was moonlighting as a bartender.

Drew Carey: Our first date we went to Disneyland. ... And ... I was, like, so amazed by her ... I was telling people at work. ... ""Wow, I met this great girl. Her name's Amie.""

Like Drew, Amie Harwick had grown up in middle America. In her case, a small Pennsylvania town.

AMIE HARWICK [modeling agency video]: It was always just a challenge to figure out where I belonged ... And it took a really long time for me to figure out who I was as a person.

She had been adopted and had, at one point, briefly been in foster care. As a teen, she was drawn to an offbeat crowd.

Sharon Little: We would go to the bathroom and do our makeup together and skip class.

The ladies' room wasn't just where Sharon Little and Amie Harwick went to goof off; it's where they first met. One day in tenth grade, Sharon says she was sobbing after hearing a close friend had died, when someone she didn't know offered her a hug.

Sharon Little (crying): She saw me crying and just held me.

Both craving understanding, Sharon says they seemed to understand each other instinctively.

Sharon Little: I felt she knew exactly what I was feeling.

In 2001, Amie settled in LA, planning to get a psychology degree, but she needed money.

Drew Carey: She worked her way through college ... she worked, like, bartending, go-go dancing.

""She had a fire act that she would do. And like really hustled,"" said Drew Carey. Robert Coshland

She got gigs at nightclubs and parties around town.

Sharon Little: She was blooming. She was eating fire ...

Drew Carey: She had a fire act that she would do. And like really hustled.

Amie's hustle, smarts and passion for personal growth eventually paid off.

Armed with a master's degree in clinical psychology and eventually a Ph.D. in human sexuality, she opened a private practice and worked with clients who were often shunned.

AMIE HARWICK (""Good Morning La La Land""): I work with sex workers or people that might be previously sex workers ...

Amie brought her unique mix of compassion and charisma to a YouTube audience, too.

AMIE HARWICK (YouTube): Hey, this is Dr. Amie Harwick ... AMIE HARWICK (YouTube): You communicate what you're looking to do ... what your boundaries are ...

Part of what made her so interesting, say friends, were her own colorful interests.

Grace Stanley: Taxidermy and things like that.

""Well, this is a collection of her poison bottles,"" Robert Coshland tells ""48 Hours"" correspondent Erin Moriarty. CBS News

But while Amie seemed to have a morbid fascination with mortality ...

Robert Coshland: She was obsessed with death ... and in fact, at one point she had bought her own coffin.

... she also had a zest for life and living.

Grace Stanley: She did everything ... and I don't know where she got the energy from.

Drew Carey: I fell so hard for her.

Erin Moriarty: You even said that you were lucky enough to have that love of a lifetime, what did you mean by that?

Drew Carey: It was. It ... felt to me like finally, here's like everything I ever wanted.

He says Amie offered what any person would want: unconditional love.

Drew Carey: I have a lot of body issues about the way I look, and- but I would, like, take my shirt off around her and not care, and she would love me. ... like, she didn't care. She just always thought I was sexy and hot.

They got engaged in 2017.

Drew Carey: We had a great time together ... we would be, you know, in the kitchen and just start dancing.

But there were serious problems, too.

Drew Carey: There would be an article like, ""Oh, Drew Carey and Amie Harwick at a thing.""

The couple's celebrity outings sometimes brought unwanted attention to Amie.

Drew Carey: And then the next day, two days later, there'd be something.

Something would almost always appear online: negative, anonymous comments on websites that reviewed doctors, he says. And Amie feared her reputation as a therapist would be ruined. She was convinced they were written by a jealous ex-boyfriend. His name: Gareth Pursehouse.

Drew Carey: And she's like ... ""I wish you weren't famous!""

Erin Moriarty: If this was this great love, and you guys so meshed, what happened?

Drew Carey: Well, you know, we had some problems, and - I don't wanna get into it.

But Carey told ""48 Hours"" they tried hard to make it work.

Drew Carey: We went to therapy as much as we could and, you know, finally just had to call it a day. ... And it was really upsetting for both of us.

Friends say the breakup was amicable and the couple eventually fell out of touch. Carey, by then in a new relationship, says he was thrilled when, on the night before Valentine's Day in 2020, Amie suddenly reached out with a text.

Drew Carey (reading text): ""I would love to get together with you and talk."" And I said, ""Yeah, I would love to do that. I love you.""

Erin Moriarty: Are you sad you never got that chance?

Drew Carey: I never got it.

Each of Amie's friends handled her death in a different way, but when asked who they thought would hurt her, one name came to mind.

Grace Stanley: My friend is terrified of one person.

Robert Coshland: It's Gareth.

Erin Moriarty: She thought he was dangerous.

Grace Stanley: She did ... she knew what he was capable of.

ACCUSATIONS OF ASSAULT

Robert Coshland went down to the Hollywood police station and told investigators what he knew about Gareth Pursehouse, an ex-boyfriend Amie had dated years before. He was a software engineer, wannabe comedian and photographer.

Robert Coshland: They asked ... Who I thought might have done this and ... did she have any enemies? ... ""this ex of hers, Gareth ... if anyone ... it would be this guy.""

Robert Coshland says he instantly knew who might have done this to Amie: Gareth Pursehouse, an ex-boyfriend who Amie had reported for assaulting her before they broke up in 2012. She feared he was stalking her. Facebook

Coshland also told them that Amie said Pursehouse had assaulted her on more than one occasion.

""48 Hours"" tracked down numerous police reports and two restraining orders that Amie obtained against Pursehouse.

Erin Moriarty [reading]: So, this is what she wrote in April 2011:

""Gareth Pursehouse forced me to the ground, covered my mouth to prevent my yelling, kicked me. In mid-May, there were multiple arguments in which Gareth Pursehouse ... choked me, suffocated me, pushed me against walls, kicked me, dropped me to the ground with forced force, restrained me, slammed my head into the ground, and punched me with a closed fist.""

Robert Coshland: They would get in ... yelling fights. And one time she threw a pillow at him. And he hit her and bashed her head against the floor.

Robert Coshland: And then immediately he would make up and be all like,"" I'm really sorry"" and ""I love you"" and all this kind of stuff.

But it was a very different relationship when the couple first started dating, as Grace Stanley remembers.

Stanley says Amie introduced her to Pursehouse back in 2008 at a photo shoot for Bench Warmer trading cards. Back then, Amy was a model going by the name Amie Nicole.

Grace Stanley: It was very obvious when I met him that he was taken by her. ... always taking pictures of her.

Grace Stanley: I honestly think she was looking for the nice guy, the safe guy, the guy who wasn't going to break her heart or cheat on her. ... when there's somebody who is that into you, you don't think that they're going to hurt you.

Rudy Torres: He was - he was loud ... charming. A little goofy.

Pursehouse posted videos on social media.

Stanley says there was no sign of a relationship in trouble in the beginning, but something now strikes her as strange.

Grace Stanley: I never saw her and him together while they were dating ... and I kind of wonder if he was kind of keeping her away from her friends.

Eventually, Amie could no longer hide the signs of abuse. Friends say she started documenting her injuries.

Erin Moriarty: He was hurting her. Does that fit the Amie you know? To stay in a bad situation like that?

Robert Coshland: Actually, yes, it does ... she really would wanna make relationships work ... even if they weren't working for her. ... She did not like to lose at all. So, I think a relationship breaking up ... would feel like a loss ... and she was very much about maintaining things that she had, even if they weren't good.

Grace Stanley: I just remember doing the friend thing ... ""leave him, leave him. Like, that's not a relationship you want to stay in.""

Erin Moriarty: And how did she react to saying get out of that relationship?

Grace Stanley: She absolutely agreed.

Amie finally ended their relationship in 2012.

Rudy Torres: Gareth didn't take that very well at all. He would start to get obsessive.

Rudy Torres: He always wanted to know where she was at ... he used to want me to be his go-between, which, I did not wanna do. He'd always ask me to send her ... photos, send her links to sappy love songs. ... and he wouldn't take no for an answer.

Rudy Torres: And he just kind of blew up and said ... ""you have to pick, it's either me or her."" ... and I went with her and after that he cut me off.

AMIE HARWICK (YouTube): The video today is on how to survive the breakup.

Amie Harwick was a practicing therapist with a master's degree and a Ph.D., Genevieve Marie



Amie was determined to move on from Pursehouse. Not only did she survive, she thrived. But nearly four years after the breakup, someone broke into her home.

Robert Coshland: She called me she's like I think he broke into my house and stole my photo albums and my computer ... It had been wiped.

Robert Coshland: She believed it was him, she couldn't prove it, she didn't have cameras.

Grace Stanley: She felt as though maybe he was watching somehow ... she felt like he could maybe have bugged her things.

Amie was convinced Pursehouse was behind some of the insulting and derogatory online comments she had been getting for years. Gareth had also sent messages to her friends designed to sabotage her friendships.

Grace Stanley: It seemed ridiculous. ... Surely, he's moved on by now.

But then, on January 16, 2020, they crossed paths for the first time in eight years. The prominent sex therapist received a last-minute invite to the annual XBIZ awards, an adult film industry gala.

That's where she spotted Pursehouse working the event. She tried to stay calm, but she later told Robert Coshland when Gareth saw her, he went ballistic.

Robert Coshland: And he was yelling in her face saying, ""You've ruined my life."" And reciting text messages she had sent to him in 2012. And like, you know, created a giant scene.

Robert Coshland: There's like a hundred people in this room and he's screaming. He is working the event. He's a big guy and he's screaming at her, sobbing ... falls to the ground in a fetal position wailing.

After the show, Amie spent 45 minutes speaking privately with Pursehouse, away from everyone, but still within view of security guards.

Robert Coshland: She told me she went into therapist mode ... and tell him, like ... he needs to, like, get on with his life ... but in a non-confrontational, as best possible way. ... she felt like she had talked him down.

Robert Coshland: But ... she was unnerved by the whole thing ... After that, she was like, ""I want to share my phone location with you."" ... ""If anything ever happens to me ... it's him.""

Grace Stanley: She wanted to up the security in her house. She wanted pepper spray. She was taking the steps of somebody who was scared.

Two weeks after the run-in with Gareth, Amie called her parents, with an unexpected request.

Robert Coshland: She ... told them that, if I die, I want to have an open casket funeral and I want an elaborate headstone and ... like, very explicit wishes.

Then, just a day before Valentine's Day 2020, there was that text from Amie reaching out to Drew Carey.

Drew Carey: I was really happy ... I was like, ""Oh, it'd be great to see her again.""

But Carey would never hear from Amie again. Robert Coshland would deliver the heartbreaking news.

Drew Carey: And he goes, ""Hey - Amie was murdered."" And - I just started like, ""What?"" And I - and I just started crying ... And I just - I couldn't even stand up. And - I - you know, I didn't think that was possible.

News of Amie's death exploded across the country.

And within hours, detectives tracked down Gareth Pursehouse at his home, and charged him with her murder. Now, prosecutors set out to build their case against him.

Rhonda Saunders: It's going to be a fight.



A LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE

In September 2021, a year-and-a-half after his arrest, Gareth Pursehouse appeared at the Los Angeles Superior Court for a preliminary hearing. Rudy Torres, once Pursehouse's good friend, wanted to be there - for Amie.

Rudy Torres: You want to know what those last moments were like for her. And you just need to be there because someone has to be in that room for her.

Cameras were not allowed inside the hearing itself, where a judge would determine if there was enough evidence to try Pursehouse for the murder of Amie Harwick.

Rhonda Saunders: You know, there's no such thing as a slam dunk case, ever.

Rhonda Saunders was a deputy district attorney in LA for 33 years. She is not involved in this case but reviewed court records at ""48 Hours"" request. At the hearing, prosecutors discussed Amie's autopsy, which documents apparent defensive wounds on her arms and hands. There was also a pattern of broken blood vessels around Amie's eyes called petechiae, which can be evidence of strangulation.

Rhonda Saunders: There not only were the petechiae, but there were bruises on her neck.

But was Gareth Pursehouse the intruder on the night of February 14, 2020? Prosecutors presented evidence of DNA recovered from the French door and the living room floor, which they said was a match to Pursehouse.

Rudy Torres: The word of the day was septillion. ... That's the one with 24 zeroes. ... Most of the stuff went over my head, but I can remember septillion.

Torres is correct - investigators said the chance that the DNA belonged to anyone other than Pursehouse was less than one in one septillion. And perhaps more disturbing, they say Pursehouse's DNA was on Amie's fingernails. Torres says he's disturbed by the idea of Amie's last moments alive -the roughly 6 minutes after she sent her last text and before her roommate knocked on the neighbor's door for help.

Rudy Torres: Six minutes. Her last moments on earth were six minutes. And that's probably the most scary part of all this, that she - doesn't sound like a long time, but she fought for six minutes.

At the hearing, the defense questioned whether that DNA was collected and tested correctly, and they questioned whether Pursehouse was there at all. But a neighbor's home security video from the night of Valentine's Day - played in court - shows an intruder that Torres believes is Pursehouse.

Rudy Torres: He puts his hand over the camera so it doesn't see him ... but you know somebody for that long it's like seeing him from a distance. It looked like him.

Gareth Pursehouse's DNA was found on Amie Harwick's fingernails and in her home. He was arrested and charged her murder. He pleaded not guilty. Instagram

Gareth Pursehouse pleaded not guilty, and his defense attorneys argue that none of the evidence collected by the state proves murder. They say even if that intruder was Pursehouse - and they don't agree it was - he could have gone there just to talk to Amie, and her fall off the balcony could have been an accident.

Rudy Torres: That's ridiculous. ... He's tall. And she's tiny. ... She's unmatched in any way you can quantify.

Robert Coshland: He may have wanted to say some things to her, but I think he went there to kill her.

Police found Amie Harwick lying 20 feet beneath her bedroom balcony in the courtyard outside her home. Inside, blood on a door and on the balcony, and a syringe containing a liquid that lab tests later revealed to be nicotine - which can be a lethal poison. Robert Coshland

Then there's that syringe that police say they found on Amie's balcony. Lab tests later revealed that it contained nicotine, which can be a lethal poison. Robert Coshland believes that syringe could only have been there for one reason.

Robert Coshland: That just really, I think, showed that he had intent - murderous intent, because there's no benign reason to have a syringe of nicotine, ever.

Although very rare, there have been murder cases involving lethal doses of nicotine - notably one that ""48 Hours"" covered: the case of Paul Curry who was found guilty of the 1994 poisoning of his wife Linda with the toxin.

Dr. Neal Benowitz: If you take it orally by mouth or by skin, then it takes much longer because absorption takes a while ... But if you have it intravenously, then you can die within minutes.

Dr. Neal Benowitz, a leading expert on nicotine, who wrote a report about the Harwick case, spoke to ""48 Hours"" in 2014 about how someone could make a high concentration solution of the drug.

Dr. Neal Benowitz (holding up a vial): This would be a concentrated nicotine solution that could kill somebody.

Police say they later found a syringe in Pursehouse's home similar to the one filled with nicotine. Prosecutors argued that the presence of that poison at Amie's home is evidence of Pursehouse's murderous intentions.

Rhonda Saunders: The prosecutor has to show that intent to harm her, to kill her. Why else would there be a syringe with that toxin in it?

At the hearing, Amie's friends testified about her fear of Pursehouse, and the measures she had taken-including the home security system, buying pepper spray, and allowing Robert Coshland to track her phone. After her death, Robert located Amie's email password, and says he found what may be the most haunting evidence against Pursehouse, written by Amie herself.

Erin Moriarty: You found something in her Gmail.

Robert Coshland: Yes.

Erin Moriarty: That became very important, didn't it?

Robert Coshland: Yeah.

Amie used her email to document her frightening encounter with Pursehouse at the XBIZ awards show. She wrote:

""He started screaming ... you shouldn't be here, why are you here ... He was sobbing. ... He was distorting his face up and shaking violently ...""

Erin Moriarty: What does that say to you - that kind of reaction with just running into a woman that he has not had contact with for years?

Kris Mohandie: This was terrifying to her and ... She should have been terrified, because that's not normal.

Forensic psychologist Kris Mohandie.

Kris Mohandie: This email is a voice, you know, of what Amie Harwick was experiencing.

In it she also writes, ""It terrifies me that he's been obsessed with me for nine years ... He's malicious, highly intelligent, and focused on harming me.""

Rhonda Saunders: What that email shows is that there is no way after writing that even to herself, that she would have invited him over, that she would have had anything to do with him, that she was afraid of him.

The question now is for the judge to decide. Is there enough evidence to take Gareth Pursehouse to trial? Amie's friends have no doubts.

Erin Moriarty: Do you think she fell off the balcony?

Cleopatra Slough: No.

Robert Coshland: No. ... not at all.

Robert Coshland: She literally said, ""if anything ever happens to me, it's Gareth."" She told those exact words to me.

WANTING BETTER FOR AMIE

Grace Stanley: You know, she'd had other relationships that hadn't ended well. But they never came up.

Amie's close friend Grace Stanley also testified at the Gareth Pursehouse hearing-about texts she had from Amie relaying her fears about him.

Grace Stanley: She never really liked to text much about Gareth. She certainly didn't like to use his name.

Erin Moriarty: Why? Did she think he might see it?

Grace Stanley: She felt as though maybe he was watching somehow. She'd always felt that.

After six days of evidence and arguments, the judge ruled there was more than enough to bind Pursehouse over for trial for the murder of Amie Harwick.

Erin Moriarty: Will you go to the trial?

Rudy Torres: Yes. ... There's a small group of us and we've agreed that, no matter what, there will always be somebody in that room for her.

Musician and friend Sharon Little intends to be there too.

Sharon Little: I want the judge to see how important she was. And, you know, and I wanted to be there for her.

Psychologist Kris Mohandie thinks the state's case against Pursehouse, if true, reflects a deep obsession with Amie, first documented in those long-ago court records that was reignited after that chance encounter on the red carpet.

Kris Mohandie: There may have been a lull through these years, but at that awards event it got the pursuit started all over again.

Pursehouse has not been charged with stalking and has pleaded not guilty to Amie's murder. But Kris Mohandie believes that if the state's allegations are true, his alleged crime would fit the pattern of what he calls obsessional pursuit. He also says it's likely that Amie was responding to Gareth with sympathy and not safety for herself as her first concern.

Erin Moriarty: In hindsight, was it a mistake for her to try to calm him down, defuse the situation?

Kris Mohandie: I'm not sure I would call it a mistake. I would call her decision to talk with him twice that evening to try to calm him, to be her humanity.

However, the safest course of action for stalking victims, Mohandie says, is never to engage their stalker if they can help it. Well-meant human kindness can be twisted by stalkers' delusions and fuel their rage.

Kris Mohandie: And that rage, they don't heal from it. They - it becomes this living thing that they nurture and feed. And what you see in in this case, if true, is a nine-year window of that.

Amie's friends say she was never going to let her fear of Pursehouse shut down her life.

Robert Coshland: You can't live your life in fear. ... If you wanna live in fear, you're giving that person control over you. And that's not who she was. She was her own person and she was gonna control her own destiny and she would never give him that power. Ever.

Erin Moriarty: This is - it's almost two years. The pain has not gone away, has it?

Robert Coshland: No. (Cleopatra Slough, sitting beside Coshland, shakes her head, ""no."") I don't think it ever will.

""I feel like a widower, you know, in a lot of ways, because I wanted to marry her, and then we had this horrible breakup,"" Drew Carey said. ""And then before I could talk to her again, somebody killed her."" Robert Coshland

Erin Moriarty: Is Valentine's Day hard for you?

Drew Carey: Terrible. Yeah (emotional) ... Yeah. Valentine's Day sucks now. That's not a good day to remember.

Erin Moriarty: Do you have regrets?

Rudy Torres: Yeah. I think we all do. You know, you always think, I could have done more, I should have done more, I should have been there, I should have listened more.

But one thing Rudy Torres is clear on is what he can do now. He calls on other men to join him.

Rudy Torres: A lot of this is a problem because men need to hold other men accountable.

Drew Carey says he hopes Amie's death and the attention it has received will help bring more awareness to intimate partner violence and the very real dangers of stalking.

Drew Carey: You can't be a person in this country and not know a woman who hasn't been a victim of domestic violence. You just can't. ... And it's really a problem that not enough people acknowledge.

Erin Moriarty: What will you miss about her the most? Is there one thing? That you just think...?

Robert Coshland: Her. Just her. Her, you know, sittin' next to me. You know, I hear her voice in my head every day.

Sharon Little: Every time I feel depressed, and I don't feel like getting up in the morning and I - I just say, ""She can't get up. You've gotta do it for - you've gotta get up for her.""

Amie's parents shared a statement:

""As we approach the 2 year anniversary of Amie's death, we remain thankful for the unwavering support of our extended family and friends. Many of Amie's close friends communicate with us regularly, attend court hearings, and update us on those proceedings. We are very grateful. Our hope is that 2022 will bring justice for Amie and focus on her life, her work, and her accomplishments.""

""... she helped so many women, and she would've helped so many more,"" friend Rudy Torres said of Amie Harwick. Earl Fulcher

Drew Carey: She cared so much about helping people. That was her life's purpose. She just wanted to help people. Especially women.

Erin Moriarty: You really miss her, don't you?

Rudy Torres: It's like, I may have lost a friend and a lot of us lost a friend. But she was en route to just help so many people ... In her chosen field, she helped so many women, and she would've helped so many more. ... it's more than just losing a friend.

PHOENIX — On what would have been Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 93rd birthday, his family took to the streets of Phoenix to push for voting rights legislation.

Hundreds of people marched with Martin Luther King III, Arndrea Waters King, and Yolanda Renee King during the Deliver for Voting Rights event on Saturday.

The focus of the gathering was to urge lawmakers in Washington to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act after 19 states, including Arizona, with predominately Republican legislatures, passed 34 laws in 2021 that change voting access.

Activists have said those legislations make it harder to vote.

“This is the most important issue in my judgment that any of us could be addressing,” said King III after 12 News asked him why his family chose to be in Arizona for his father’s birthday.

“My father was here in 1964 talking. If the filibuster is not addressed, it will do great harm for the health of our nation, and it’s tragic that about over 60 years later we are still addressing the issue of voting. It should have been done,” King III said adding that the fight for voting rights is not over.

The King family emphasized their issue with Senator Kyrsten Sinema after she announced this week that she would not support eliminating the filibuster rules.

Democrats need to kill the 60-vote requirement to pass voting rights legislation.

“Senator Sinema our future hinges on your decision and history will remember what you choose to [do],” said Yolanda Renee King, the first and only grandchild of Dr. King. “So, join me in demanding action for today, tomorrow and generations to come.”

The Senate is expected to debate on voting rights legislation on Tuesday.

Ahead of MLK day on Monday, King III called for legislators to not celebrate his father’s birthday or use any of his quotes this holiday weekend, but to instead help push legislation that will expand voter access to all Americans.

“I don’t want to see photo ops of elected officials going to black churches or sing with the choir if they are not willing to put voting rights over the filibuster,” King III said. “I certainly don’t want to hear any of our leaders say they support voting rights legislation while standing in its way.”

https://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/World/20220125/3900202.html,British Pakistani grilled in blogger Ahmad Waqass Goraya's murder plot case,"The UK prosecution on Tuesday grilled 31-year-old British Pakistani Gohir Khan about his intention to travel to the Netherlands allegedly as part of a conspiracy to kill self-exiled blogger Ahmad Waqass Goraya. The trial entered its second week on Monday. The prosecution alleged that Khan had travelled to Rotterdam last year as part of a conspiracy to murder Goraya, and that he had undertaken a reconnaissance mission outside his home and even bought a tool with the aim to succeed in his mission, reported Dawn. Alison Morgan QC led the prosecution and questioned why Khan did not approach the police when he was contacted by the Pakistan-based middleman Muzamil to kill someone; why Mr Khan kept asking if the 'job' or killing was a debt-related one; why he purchased a knife; and why he made efforts to deceive the immigration authorities to enter the Netherlands. While maintaining that he was not guilty of intent to kill, the defendant claimed he ""never intended to kill anyone"", but that he ""wanted to get money out of Muzamil as he owed him money"". He said he purchased the knife to cut steak, fruit and bread and travelled to the Netherlands to convince Muzamil to give him more money, reported Dawn. He claimed the messages he sent to the middleman about the tool, the target and the job were meant only to give him the impression that he (Khan) was serious about the job but in reality all he wanted was money. Morgan cross-examined Khan for several hours, going back to the timeline of events as established by Whatsapp and Signal messages, CCTV footage and receipts. She pressed Khan on why he purchased a knife for 10.99 euros when there were cheaper options available, and why he waited until the next day to use the knife to eat the steak as he had wanted. She also asked why Khan kept the receipt for the knife despite discarding others, and why he did not mention the knife to the police till he was confronted about it, to which he responded that he forgot as he had a lapse of memory, reported Dawn. The prosecution will continue his cross-examination on Tuesday, and the jury will then review the statements of the defence and prosecution before it comes to a decision. At previous hearings, the jury was told how Muzamil allegedly contacted Khan in 2021 with an offer to pay Pound 80,000 for the job, while telling him about his own commission of Pound 20,000. It is unclear who Muzamil was working for, but evidence that Pound 5,000 was paid into a Pakistani bank account and received through a hundi transfer in London has been shared in the court, reported Dawn. Meanwhile, Pakistan's deafening silence on the disclosers made in the UK Court in the case of Khan has raised serious questions on the country's stand on human rights and free speech. (ANI)",Q1
https://www.kxxv.com/news/methodist-conservatives-to-launch-breakaway-group-in-may,Methodist conservatives to launch breakaway group in May,"(AP) — A group of theologically conservative United Methodists plans to launch a new worldwide denomination on May 1, impatient to get started after yet another pandemic-related delay to a formalized divorce agreement with their denomination.

The creation of the Global Methodist Church, announced Thursday, was long in the making, organized by conservatives who were fed up with liberal churches’ continued defiance of the United Methodist Church’s bans on same-sex marriage and the ordination of openly gay clergy.

Global Methodist Church organizers had originally expected to launch the denomination only after the next General Conference of the UMC. That legislative body is the only one that could approve a tentative agreement — unveiled in 2020 after negotiations between conservatives, liberals and centrists — to allow churches and regional groups to leave the denomination and keep their property.

But the General Conference, originally scheduled for 2020, was already delayed for two straight years by the pandemic. On Thursday, the United Methodist Church announced it was pushing off the next gathering yet again — to 2024 — due to long delays in the U.S. processing of visa applications. A little more than half of the denomination’s members are overseas, notably in Africa and the Philippines.

UMC officials said the visa process has been delayed as long as 800 days in some cases.

“The visa issue is a reality that is simply outside our control as we seek to achieve a reasonable threshold of delegate presence and participation,” said a statement by Kim Simpson, who chairs the denomination’s Commission on the General Conference.

But the delay is hastening the breakup of one of the largest religious bodies in the United States.

Already some conservative churches have left the denomination, and more are eager to do so, said a statement from the Global Methodist Church organizers.

“Many United Methodists have grown impatient with a denomination clearly struggling to function effectively at the general church level,” said the Rev. Keith Boyette, chairman of the Transitional Leadership Council, which is organizing the Global Methodist Church.

“Theologically conservative local churches and annual conferences want to be free of divisive and destructive debates, and to have the freedom to move forward together,” he said. “We are confident many existing congregations will join the new Global Methodist Church in waves over the next few years, and new church plants will sprout up.”

Boyette, a Virginia-based Methodist elder, said he didn’t know how many churches would initially join the new denomination and “does not want to make any speculations.”

Under United Methodist law, church properties are held in trust for the larger denomination. “However there have always been avenues for churches to separate from the denomination,” said a statement from Bishop Cynthia Fierro Harvey of Louisiana, president of the UMC’s Council of Bishops. Churches can negotiate separation agreements with their bishops.

The organizers of the Global Methodist Church predicted some of its prospective members will reach amicable agreements to separate from their local conferences and that others would face more opposition.

The United Methodist Church claims 6.3 million members in the U.S. and 6.5 million overseas.

Differences over same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy have simmered for years in the UMC, and came to a head in 2019 at a conference in St. Louis where delegates voted 438-384 to strengthen bans on LGBTQ-inclusive practices. Most U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan and favored LGBTQ-friendly options; they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives teamed with most of the delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines.

In the aftermath of that meeting, many moderate and liberal clergy made clear they would not abide by the bans, and various groups worked on proposals to let the UMC split along theological lines.

The most prominent plan, the Protocol of Reconciliation & Grace Through Separation, was endorsed by a wide spectrum of bishops and activists after it was reached through famed mediation lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, whose law firm has overseen the distribution of other massive legal settlements such as the 9/11 victims fund.

Under the protocol, conservative congregations and regional bodies would be allowed to separate from the UMC and form a new denomination. They would receive $25 million in UMC funds and be able to keep their properties.

Assuming a large exodus of conservatives, the remaining United Methodist Church would be poised to reverse its longstanding bans on gay ordination and marriage.

Reconciling Ministries — a pro-LGBTQ advocacy caucus within the United Methodist Church — said that while the pandemic-related delay was necessary, “we also lament this lengthening test of our patience.”

But it pledged to “continue to work for the fullness of life for God’s LGBTQ+ children no matter when the next General Conference is held.”",Q1

Hankison has pleaded not guilty to three counts of wanton endangerment for allegedly firing wildly into the apartments of Taylor’s neighbors during the March 2020 raid. Taylor, a Black woman, was shot multiple times. No drugs were found in the 26-year-old emergency medical technician's apartment, and the warrant was later found to be flawed.

No officers were charged for causing Taylor's death, despite protests nationwide, with many demonstrators demanding that the officers involved stand trial for murder. That set the outcome apart from two other killings of Black people at the hands of white people in 2020 that put race relations in the national spotlight: the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police, and the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased by three men while running through a Georgia neighborhood.

Arbery's pursuers were sentenced to life in prison for murder last month, and their federal hate crimes trial is set to begin next week. Former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years for murder and manslaughter, and his fellow officers are now being tried in state court.

In the Taylor case, Kentucky's Republican Attorney General, Daniel Cameron determined that the officers fired into her apartment in self-defense after her boyfriend shot at them first as they broke into her apartment. Cameron, who is Black, acknowledged that Taylor's death was heartbreaking, but he did not give a grand jury the option of charging anyone with killing her.

Hankison, who faces one to five years in prison on each of the wanton endangerment counts, is the only officer facing any criminal charges from the raid.

The jury selection process, which began last Friday, is expected to take weeks. Potential jurors will be asked questions to determine if they can serve as fair and impartial jurors. The pool of Jefferson County residents will be whittled down to 12 jurors, plus alternates.

Jefferson Circuit Judge Ann Bailey Smith denied a request by Hankison’s attorney to move the trial out of Louisville. The attorney had argued that publicity surrounding the case would make it hard to seat an impartial jury.

PTI workers stage protest to denounce no-confidence move

The workers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Hyderabad chapter staged a protest outside Hyderabad Press Club here on Friday to denounce the no confidence move against Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Led by Mustansir Billah, the PTI protesters chanted slogans against the leaders of the Opposition parties, blaming them for bribing some of the elected representatives of the PTI to try to change their loyalty.

Billah said that it was right of the political parties represented in the National Assembly to bring the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister. “However, it is undemocratic and immoral to buy off the MNAs of PTI so that they can vote against the PM,” he said.

He argued that the imposition of the Governor Rule had become inevitable in Sindh because of rampant corruption and bad governance. The protesters requested the federal government to impose the Governor Rule.",Q1

https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htatrit/articles/20220210.aspx,Attrition: SINKEX Goes To War,"The U.S. Navy has resumed holding damage assessment exercises to prepare for handling ships damaged in future combat. The first exercise was conducted while towing a burned-out amphibious ship to the scrappers. A battle damage assessment team was put aboard the ship to record damage as they would in wartime. The assessors had never been on the ship before and were able to perform a realistic assessment. The subject ship was destroyed by a shipyard fire in July 2020 and decommissioned in April 2021. These assessment drills will be held in the future during exercises as part of SINKEX operations.

For most of the last century the U.S. Navy has conducted SINKEX training. In the last two decades about two ships a year were sunk, most off the coast of California or Hawaii. SINKEX enables the navy to test new theories on how vulnerable, or invulnerable, modern warships are and how effective new, or current, weapons are. With the advent of smaller, cheaper, and more reliable sensors and broadcasting gear it's possible to get a lot more data out of a SINKEX target and monitor the damaged ship as it is hit until it goes under. This leads to changes in ship design and damage control techniques. From now on the ship to be sunk will first be damaged by a smaller explosion and a damage assessment team put about to assess the damage. After that the SINKEX will be completed using ship or aircraft weapons.

In the last few years, the navy has suffered several collisions at sea that required long repairs and it was realized that such damage would be common in any future war and the navy did not have as many repair facilities as in past wars. This made the return of trained damage assessment teams a necessity.

It was also noted that China, our most likely adversary, had no shortage of shipyards capable of making repairs. That is because China has invested a lot of money and effort into expanding its merchant shipbuilding industry, as a way to improve its warship building capability. In 2006 China produced about a quarter of the world's merchant shipping, while South Korea was in the first place, producing about a third. China made it to first place by 2020 largely by increasing orders for warships. China now has the largest fleet, in terms of warships, not tonnage. Chinese shipyards repair and upgrade warships as well as merchant ships.

By 1945 the United States had the largest fleet, and shipbuilding industry, in the world. Over the next few decades European and then East Asian took business away from the Americans with lower prices and better quality. By the 1990s China had entered the competition and had a hard time competing with South Korea and Japan, but eventually they did. The U.S. Navy is still the largest fleet in terms of tonnage but does not have nearly as much warship repair capacity as it would need in a major war.

The U.S. Navy is also behind schedule in completing planned maintenance, repairs and new construction shipyard work because of a shortage of ship yards and difficulty in finding qualified personnel. For warships you need shipyard workers to have special skills and qualified candidates are hard to find. Hiring temporary replacements means bringing in unskilled workers who can be trained for low skill jobs. Normally, some retirees could be persuaded to come back for an emergency but these experienced men are less and less available.

The navy did have a solution for this; the 2005 “SurgeMain” program where over 2,400 navy reservists were identified who had skills that could be used in the shipyards, where a lot of work was making major repairs on ships so the vessels can go back to sea. These are the kinds of repairs that the ship crew can handle but ships are brought into shipyards every few years so the many backlogged repairs can be done in less time because the ship is not at sea and most of the crew is not present.

In 2020 the SurgeMain program brought in 1,600 reservists but this only made up for about a quarter of the shortage. The labor shortage is also threatening some critical shipbuilding projects, like components for the new Colombia class SSBNs (ballistic missile nuclear subs) where construction of the subs is to begin in 2021. Before that a lot of key components were being built and work on these items had been delayed by the worker shortage. As it is the reservists were told that they could be on active duty for up to a year. The navy is still working on calculating how much the labor shortage will delay ships getting back to sea or even built.

Another problem with unskilled workers is accidents, some of them deliberate. For example, in May 2012 there was a fire inside the USS Miami (a Los Angeles class SSN or nuclear attack submarine) while it was in the Portsmouth (Maine) Naval Yard for maintenance and upgrades. That blaze did $400 million in damage to the sub and seven people were injured. Two months later a shipyard worker was arrested for setting the fire. The accused worker, Casey J. Fury, admitted that he set the May 23rd fire and another on June 16th, which was quickly extinguished, in order to get out of work early. Casey was seen near the June 16th fire and that led to his being questioned more closely. Casey knew he had a problem and checked himself into a mental hospital on June 21st and left on June 23rd. The question now arises as to how someone like this was allowed to work on a nuclear submarine. It could be sloppiness, union politics, or fear of federal regulations as in a growing list of questions you cannot ask when hiring people. The U.S. Navy has been complaining for a long time about incompetent management of naval shipyards. That bad behavior is protected by politicians more interested in reelection than well run yards.

Another solution, first adopted in 2009 was to reduce the number of days ships are at sea by a third, in order to reduce the wear and tear on its ships, and to provide cash and port time for needed maintenance. The days-at-sea problems began with the end of the Cold War in 1991, as the navy sought to maintain the same high tempo of operations, and even increase it. That meant sending carrier and amphibious task forces out to sea for six- month cruises to distant parts of the planet more frequently than before. After September 11, 2001, the tempo of operations increased even more, to support the war on terror.

To support all this on smaller post-Cold War budgets, the navy downsized. In the 1990s, the US Navy decommissioned over 300 ships. In 1990, the navy was still trying to increase its warship strength to 600. With the end of the Cold War, and the threat of the huge (but now disintegrating) Soviet fleet, there were suddenly more crises and hot spots the navy felt it had to deal with. While only about a quarter of all ships were at sea during the Cold War, in the 1990s about a third were out there. This put more strain on sailors, as marriages fell apart and sailors got tired of the constant stress of sea duty.

In response, the navy has focused on building new ships that used 50-80 percent fewer sailors. This is not as extreme as it sounds, for commercial ships have been doing this for several decades. But the smaller crews have not arrived yet, because the new ships have proved too expensive to build. Meanwhile, the navy was putting off doing a lot of ship maintenance, especially stuff that requires replacing lots of parts on engines and other mechanical and electrical systems. The result has been more ships failing inspections and having problems while at sea. The decision to cut days at sea, and catch up on maintenance, makes sense.

All these earlier problems, and their solutions led to the realization that there were not enough shipyards, qualified workers and damage assessment capabilities to deal with the problem.",Q1

Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has blasted President Joe Biden and the House Democrats for their “war on American energy,"" accusing them of being “out of touch” with the crises facing the US population.Warning that gas prices were “at an all-time high” because the current administration had failed to unleash US energy dominance or shed dependence on “foreign adversaries for oil,” the House Republican Conference chairwoman blasted her Democratic counterpart and admitted that high gas prices “hadn’t come up” during House Democrat caucus meetings.US Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) of Brooklyn, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, had made the remark to reporters at a Tuesday press conference when asked what the Democrats were saying on the issue.""But I think increasing the global oil supply, at the moment, to the extent that there are implications, particularly for Europe, which is more heavily reliant upon Russian oil than we are here in the United States of America. You know, it’s an important discussion,"" Jeffries added.The GOP congresswoman also promised that once the hen Republicans “take back the House” during the November midterm elections, they would “work to unleash America's energy dominance to drive down prices at the pump and end the financial suffering Americans face daily because of Biden and House Democrats' failed far-left agenda.""Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., also took issue with Jeffries’ comments.He was amazed that while Americans were paying record prices at the pump, Democrats failed to even discuss a plan to tackle the surging prices.When asked if, indeed, the issue of rising gas prices had not come up in caucus meetings, a spokesperson for Hakeem Jeffries was later cited by the outlet as saying ""comments from the presser speak for themselves.""‘Blow to US Energy Independence’Elise Stefanik, meanwhile, also released a statement after the Biden administration announced it will ban Russian oil, saying the move was another “blow to American energy independence.”In a nod towards reports that US administration officials were in negotiations with Venezuela as a possible alternative supplier of energy, she said:“This will only make America more reliant on its adversaries. We must unleash American energy dominance and no longer depend on our foreign adversaries for oil and gas.""Echoing sentiments that had been voiced by Republicans ever since President Biden took office last year, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, ripped the current occupant of the White House for opting to “rather fund terrorism"" that bolster American energy independence.Cruz announced on Friday his new bill, the Energy Freedom Act, in a press release where he again levelled a barrage of criticism at Biden for having led America to lose “our status as a net petroleum exporter.""This comes as President Joe Biden signed an executive order on 8 March, instituting a near-total ban on Russian energy supplies, vowing that the prohibition of Russia-sourced oil and gas would deal “another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.”While the POTUS admitted that the decision would incur “costs” on Americans, he suggested that “defending freedom has a cost.”Russia accounts for about 20 percent of global natural gas production, and about 10 percent of the world’s oil supplies. Energy prices soared dramatically in recent days from the prospect of a partial loss of Russia’s massive oil and gas output.US gasoline prices reached a new national record on Tuesday of $4.17 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.The US Department of Energy earlier revealed it intended to partially offset the loss of Russian oil by increasing domestic crude production by 60,000 bpd by the end of 2022 to 12.03 million bpd total.Furthermore, the shortfall is also expected to be replaced, in part, via imports possibly from Saudi Arabia, Iran or Venezuela, with the latter two nations suffering under crippling Washington sanctions.Russia itself has officially turned into the most heavily sanctioned nation in the world, according to astellum.ai, a sanction tracking service, after the sweeping new restrictions placed on Russia by the West over the crisis in Ukraine.Moscow began a military operation ""to demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine on 24 February after weeks of escalating shelling, sabotage, and sniper attacks by Ukrainian forces against the Donbass republics, whose predominantly Russian-speaking population has been subjected to “abuse, genocide… for eight years.""Established in the spring of 2014 in response to the Western-backed coup in Kiev, the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics (LPR, DPR) refused to accept the overthrow of the country’s legitimate government and its allegedly ultranationalist and pro-western forces.In February, Russia formally recognised the DPR and LPR, and launched its special military operation after the Donbass republics’ authorities asked for assistance to defend themselves from continued attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian government has repeatedly stated that the goal of the current operation was to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity and not harm the civilian population of the country.Lets stay in touch no matter what!

Marshall Fire Victims Being Price Gouged On Rent

December 30th, 2021, is a day that no Colorado person will soon forget as the horrific scenes of the Marshall Fire running rampant all over the great cities of Superior and Louisville, leaving next to nothing in its path, will always live in our minds.

Watching the news coverage and seeing these families' homes, with all of their prized possessions and memories, go up in flames in seconds. Feeling helpless knowing, not even the firefighters could battle the extreme wind conditions to slow the fire from spreading so quickly.

Now that the damage has been done, these homeowners are doing their best to look to the future and rebuild their lives one day at a time. Sadly though, some people are taking advantage of an extremely heartbreaking situation, especially when it comes to rental properties in the area.

Facebook user Elyse Zuniga created a post showing multiple rental homes charging almost double what the rent would typically be. Here are just a few of the examples she posted.

As seen in the post, this estimated rent on this home is $2,858, they now have listed at $4,295.

Or this one which is estimated to rent for $2,134 asking for almost $4,000.

$5,800 for a 3 bedroom house in Louisville? Wow.

$6,500 for a 3 bedroom house in Superior?

Or even this 2 bedroom apartment in Broomfield nearly doubles its price to $3,000.

While some in the Facebook posts comment chain are sighting ""supply and demand"", this seems a bit extreme considering what these people just went through. Using the lowest point in some of these people's lives as a cash grab really speaks volumes to their true character.

It's gotten so bad that Attorney General Phil Weisler has spoken out to the major real estate marketplace businesses in the area to encourage them to do whatever they can do to stop this ridiculous price gouging. You can see the entire Facebook post and more ridiculous price-gouging home photos HERE.

https://news.wgcu.org/2022-01-20/15-week-abortion-ban-bill-passes-first-fl-house-committee,15-Week Abortion Ban Bill Passes First FL House Committee,"A Florida House panel, Wednesday, advanced a controversial bill (HB 5) that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The proposal includes exceptions, including pregnancies that pose a risk to the life of a woman seeking an abortion and cases of fetuses with a fatal abnormality that have not reached viability. The measure does not include exceptions for rape or incest.

The House Professions & Public Health Subcommittee approved the bill on a 12- 6 party-line vote with Democrats in opposition. The measure is similar to Mississippi’s new abortion restriction legislation, that has been taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The proposal is titled, Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality. “We will be saving approximately nearly 5,000 babies a year with this bill being in place,” said bill sponsor Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach according to the News Service of Florida.

“There is no prohibition on abortion in this bill. There is a prohibition on how long you can obtain an abortion. So, there’s nothing that prohibits a woman from getting an abortion up to 15 weeks.”

State Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, said the title is misleading.

“Here we are with a bill that not only ignores the fact that abortion access has proven to decrease infant mortality because people can have power in deciding when they are ready to become parents, but it is a bill that tries to pit against the reproductive health rights community and we’re not here to play that game,” said Eskamani.

The News Service of Florida reports other Democrats on the committee voiced their opposition as well, including Rep. Fentrice Driskell, D-Tampa. “We should make them legal and accessible, and then we should stay the hell out of the way,” said Driskell.

Federal rulings have long held that states cannot ban abortions prior to viability, and a privacy clause in Florida’s constitution has been found by the state supreme court to uphold those same parameters. Rep. Grall said she expects those holdings will be overturned.

“The court just sometimes gets it wrong and I think the court has gotten it wrong when it comes to the viability standard and we anticipate that being overturned at the federal level and the way the supreme court has interpreted the privacy clause in the state of Florida puts us in a unique position where that will obviously be taken up again by the court should we pass this law, but the history of that privacy clause and the way it was interpreted also suggests the court just got it wrong,” said Grall.

The House bill would have to pass two more committee stops before it could go before the full chamber. A Senate companion bill (SB 146) has yet to be heard in committee.",Q1

Lahore police on Saturday registered a case against unknown assailants a day after a gun attack on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MPA Bilal Yaseen by unknown armed men.

According to the FIR registered at the Data Darbar police station, the PML-N leader said two men on a motorcycle attempted to kill him outside the house of a PML-N worker near Data Darbar.

As a result, Yaseen got bullet wounds on his leg and abdomen, the FIR maintained, adding that he was currently under treatment at Mayo Hospital.

Meanwhile, sources in the police blamed the murder attempt on contract killers. They said that they were investigating the causes and perpetrators of the attack.

According to the police, they have compiled lists of Lahore's top shooters and raids were being conducted to arrest the suspects.

A day earlier, Yaseen was shot and injured by unidentified assailants in Lahore. According to police officials, the men on two motorcycles had opened fire on the PML-N MPA after he visited a party worker in the Data Darbar area of the city.

The MPA had suffered two bullet injuries in his leg and stomach, a police official said, adding that he was rushed to the Lahore Mayo Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment.

https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/320148,AOC tests positive for COVID-19,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), has tested positive for the coronavirus, her office said on Sunday night.

“Representative Ocasio-Cortez has received a positive test result for COVID-19. She is experiencing symptoms and recovering at home,” the statement said.

“The Congresswoman received her booster shot this fall, and encourages everyone to get their booster and follow all CDC guidance,” it added.

The positive coronavirus test comes shortly after Ocasio-Cortez was seen without a mask in a Miami bar, according to video that circulated on social media.

Last week, a reporter posted a video showing the Congresswoman waving to a large crowd of mostly unmasked bar-goers in Miami.

Days earlier, she was pictured dining without a mask outside a restaurant in Miami Beach.

Ocasio-Cortez is known for being a member of the group of Democratic lawmakers known as “The Squad” who are notorious for their anti-Israel statements.

In 2019, the then-freshman Congresswoman criticized then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 News while arguing that criticizing Israel’s policies is not being anti-Semitic.

In a previous radio interview, Ocasio-Cortez said that Israel is “criminal” in its treatment of Palestinian Arabs, whom she said have no other choice but to “riot” against the Jewish state.

Before that, she said that cutting military and economic aid to Israel as a way to signal opposition to Israeli policies should be “on the table.”

Last May, Ocasio-Cortez criticized Israel following the Muslim Arab riots and violence against Jewish civilians in Jerusalem.

Ocasio-Cortez later accused President Joe Biden of “taking the side of occupation” after he spoke with Netanyahu and told him that “Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.”",Q1

John Bruhn: California’s Milkman

Only two years into his career as a UC Cooperative Extension specialist in dairy food processing, he found himself the subject of a trade journal cover story headlined, “The Milkman: John Bruhn.”

The story in Western Milk and Ice Cream News advised milk producers and processors: “Much of the information you receive from your county extension agents is developed here [at UC Davis] in the laboratories and translated into useful, practical information by Dr. Bruhn himself.”

He would continue in that role for 37 years, from 1969 until retiring in 2006, having distinguished himself in applied research and education, and earning recognition nationally and internationally.

As a Cooperative Extension specialist emeritus, he would continue taking calls from the industry until his death Dec. 18 from congestive heart failure. He was 81.

A native of Ohio, Bruhn graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor’s degree in food science, then came to UC Davis for graduate study. He earned a Ph.D. in dairy microbiology-biochemistry in 1968 and soon began his career with Cooperative Extension, working out of the Department of Food Science and Technology.

Bruhn with his favorite beverage, surrounded by UC Davis dairy packaging for milk, buttermilk, chocolate milk and more, saved from the old Roadhouse Hall (originally the Dairy Industry Building).

He helped in the development and implementation of state and national regulatory policy and worked with many well-known brands in California and nationally on food safety and quality issues. He served as the founding director of the UC Davis Dairy Research and Information Center for 13 years.

He was an elected fellow of four professional organizations: the American Dairy Science Association (and served as its president in 2000), International Association of Food Protection, Institute of Food Technologists, and Institute of Food Science and Technology (United Kingdom). He was the recipient of the Outstanding Faculty Award of Distinction from the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences in 2009.

‘First Quality’

The John C. Bruhn Dairy Foods Scholarship was established in 2009, endowed by industry organizations, including the California Association of Dairy Milk Sanitarians, California Creamery Operators Association and California Dairy Industries Association, and the Bruhn family. The award is given annually to a master's degree student or undergraduate.

Bruhn presented each scholarship with a special gift: a University Farm butter wrapper, framed. Bruhn had saved a stash of the wrappers and other unused packaging from the old Roadhouse Hall (formerly the Dairy Industry Building) before it was torn down. The creamery inside the building had been used to produce butter, ice cream and milk until 1958.

Upon presenting the framed wrappers, Bruhn would take the opportunity to point to the words “First Quality” on the butter label, explaining what they meant to him: first quality students, first quality Department of Food Science and Technology, and first quality university.

He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Christine, a Cooperative Extension specialist emeritus in consumer foods research; daughter Laura (Roland) Freudrich; son Aron (Ashley) Bruhn; grandchildren Patrick, Peter, Hudson and Skyler; and sister Susan (David) Dirr and their children. He was preceded in death by his brother, Tom.

A celebration of life will be held at 5 p.m. Thursday, March 3, at the Lutheran Church of the Incarnation in Davis.

In lieu of flowers, the family asks people to consider contributions to the John C. Bruhn Dairy Foods Scholarship, the Lutheran Church of the Incarnation or a favorite charity.

Ed Costantini: Political scientist

Political scientist Edmond Costantini traced his keen interest in politics and current events to the decade he spent as a youth delivering newspapers in Manhattan, where his customers included future President Dwight D. Eisenhower and activist Eugene Debs.

Ed Costantini

Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University, once engaged Costantini in conversation from his driveway in the late 1940s, the former World War II general still dressed in his night shirt.

But what was more life-shaping were the wide array of leftover daily papers — up to a dozen different publications — that Costantini took home and pored over after he finished his route, he wrote in a 2018 letter to a Davis Enterprise columnist. Costantini said that the knowledge he gained from reading papers helped him stand out in school, leading to political internships, campaign work, his graduate studies and his career in political science.

20th-century politics expert

Costantini, professor emeritus of political science who died Jan. 10 at age 89 in Davis, would later become a sought-after news source himself for his expertise on California elections and politics. During his 1964-94 career at UC Davis, he studied an array of topics, many of which remain relevant today. His research, often involving survey or election data analysis, looked at the motivations and personality characteristics of political activists, intraparty conflict, public opinion on environmental issues, public opinion on affirmative action, environmental policy making, libel law, juror prejudice, women and politics, partisan voting, election law and California politics.

He also engaged in the political process — advising campaigns, serving as education secretary to Gov. Edmund “Pat” Brown in 1966, sitting on the executive board of the California Democratic Party and attending national party conventions as a California delegate, including the turbulent 1968 Democratic Party Convention in Chicago.

Helped launch Retiree Center

After retiring, Costantini worked with colleagues and campus leadership to establish the UC Davis Retiree Center to help retired staff and faculty stay connected.

“I think that Ed personified the best qualities of what made UC Davis unique,” said John Vohs, senior lecturer emeritus of communication. “He was not only a respected scholar; he was also a popular teacher as well as a faculty leader in shaping the campus culture. He contributed to that sense of community.”

Costantini joined the UC Davis faculty in 1964 as he was completing his doctoral studies in political science at UC Berkeley. He previously earned a master’s degree from the University of Connecticut and an undergraduate degree from New York University, where he was Phi Beta Kappa.

His wife of 61 years, Agnes “Aggie” Costantini, died in 2018. He is survived by a daughter and grandson, who live in the San Francisco Bay Area.",Q1
https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/04/kabul-aiport-attack/,"Kabul airport attack involved a single bomb with ‘disturbing lethality,’ Pentagon inquiry finds","A single bomb with “disturbing lethality” caused the carnage at Kabul’s international airport near the culmination of the United States’ chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, a U.S. military investigation has determined, contradicting initial statements by senior military officials that Islamic State gunmen also opened fire on the swarm of people desperate to get inside.

The investigation, details of which were presented to the media Friday, was ordered after a member of Islamic State-Khorasan, the extremist group’s affiliate in Afghanistan, detonated a suicide vest Aug. 26 in a crowded outdoor corridor just outside Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing an estimated 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops. The attack on the airfield’s Abbey Gate occurred as the U.S. military raced to evacuate thousands of Afghan allies during a frantic, two-week rescue operation set in motion when the Taliban seized control of the capital.

Marine Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, chief of U.S. Central Command, acknowledged Friday that the investigation contradicted statements he made in the immediate aftermath of the explosion. At the time, defense officials believed there was one, and possibly two, explosions and that gunmen opened fire on the crowd after.

The Defense Department released video footage of Marines at Abbey Gate before the Kabul airport attack in August 2021. (Video: Department of Defense)

That the investigation has “contradicted our first impression” was a testament to the independence of those who conducted it, McKenzie said. “It also confirms the age-old fact that the battlefield is a confusing and contradictory place, and it gets more confusing the closer you are to the actual action.”

The airport bombing was one of two high-profile incidents during the evacuation for which U.S. officials were criticized after it became apparent they had distributed inaccurate information about what transpired. The other occurred three days later, when a U.S. drone strike killed 10 civilians, including seven children — an attack senior military officials initially defended as “righteous,” saying they had killed a suspected Islamic State-Khorasan bomber preparing to hit the airport. The target, in fact, was an aid worker, and several of his family members also perished in the U.S. attack.

Army investigators determined the explosion at Abbey Gate ejected 5-millimeter ball bearings that tore into the crowd at high velocity. Forty-five U.S. troops were wounded in the blast, with some suffering brain injuries that surfaced later, defense officials said.

The bombing set off chaos inside the airfield’s outer perimeter, where Afghans clamoring to secure seats on U.S. evacuation flights had crowded.

Defense officials said Taliban foot soldiers guarding initial checkpoints made it difficult and dangerous for potential evacuees to access the airfield, forcing many to seek alternative routes inside with the assistance of U.S. personnel.

A sewage canal along the airfield’s perimeter had acted as a natural barrier early on, aiding troops with crowd control, said Army Brig. Gen. Lance Curtis, who led the investigation. But that “changed dramatically and rapidly” as more people began taking alternative paths into the airport, he added.

Officials said they believe that the Islamic State bomber, carrying 20 pounds of explosives, bypassed the Taliban checkpoint and that the Taliban had no advance knowledge of the attack.

In the moments leading up to the attack, hundreds were packed into and along the edges of the sewage canal, with Marines standing on its inner wall, spotting and pulling people from the crowd, officials said. Had U.S. personnel tried to push outward, to fortify the perimeter as the crowd surged, the Americans would have been at greater risk, Curtis said.

Investigators, he said, had concluded the attack “was not preventable.”

Disoriented service members who rushed to aid the wounded encountered tear gas — unleashed from ruptured canisters the Marines carried on their body armor — and there was initial confusion over whether the Taliban had been involved and whether the attack was still ongoing, the investigation found.

It was initially reported that some Marines and British troops opened fire in the confusion after the explosion, believing they still could be under attack. The investigation found that two British troops and one U.S. service member fired only warning shots to disperse the crowd, while one American shot at a “suspicious individual” in a water tower outside the airport perimeter. Investigators said there was no indication anyone was hit with gunfire during or after the incident.

Curtis said the gunfire caused an echo as it traveled through the confined space, creating the illusion of a firefight. Further adding to the confusion, wounds resulting from the ball bearings resembled those caused by gunshots, officials said.

The military’s inquiry lasted more than three months. It spanned five countries and involved interviews with more than 130 people, officials said. Although U.S. officials were in routine contact with the Taliban leading up to the attack and in its aftermath, investigators did not interview any Afghan witnesses.",Q1

How Jason Van Dyke’s projected 96-year sentence wound up being 81 months Friday, Jan 18, 2019 - Posted by Rich Miller * The Chicago Daily Law Bulletin just reposted an October 10, 2018 op-ed by Cook County assistant public defender David C. Holland claiming that Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke could wind up serving as many as 96 years in prison due to a “quirk” in Illinois statutes and case law. We’ll get to the column after this news report from ABC 7… Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer convicted of murdering 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, was sentenced to 81 months, or 6 years and 9 months, in prison and two years mandatory supervised release. […] Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery. Judge Vincent Gaughan said he considered the most serious charge to be the second degree murder charge, not the 16 aggravated battery charges, and made his sentencing decision on that murder charge. The special prosecutor argued that aggravated battery with firearm was the more serious of the crimes of which Van Dyke is convicted and should be sentenced consecutively on those charges instead of the second degree murder charge, which carries a lesser sentence. * According to Holland’s October op-ed, the special prosecutor was right… Second-degree murder, on the other hand, is punishable anywhere from probation to 20 years in prison with possible release after 10 years. Moreover, committing second-degree murder with a firearm does not require an extra sentence of 25 years to natural life as a first-degree murder does. […] By a quirk of Illinois law, Van Dyke may face a mandatory minimum sentence as high as 96 years. This is because the prosecution charged each gunshot as a separate offense of aggravated battery with a firearm, and each shot holds a minimum sentence of six years in prison. Illinois’ sentencing statute, however, requires that the sentence for any Class X felony (such as aggravated battery with a firearm) that causes “severe bodily injury” be served one after the next (consecutively). Thus, if Judge Gaughan finds that each shot caused severe bodily injury, he would be required to sentence Van Dyke to a minimum of 96 years in prison (16 multiplied by six). If the judge finds that only 10 of the 16 shots severely injured McDonald, the minimum sentence would be 60 years, and so forth. Moreover, even though the shooting and the murder are the same physical act, Illinois case law requires Judge Gaughan to sentence Van Dyke on the aggravated battery charges, not the second-degree murder, on the counterinstinctual holding that aggravated battery with a firearm is more “serious” than second-degree murder (even when murder is the ultimate result of the gunshot wounds). Judge Gaughan, instead, didn’t even sentence Van Dyke on the aggravated battery with a firearm charges, rolling them into the 2nd degree murder charge. * Here’s the case law that Holland pointed to. From the Illinois Supreme Court’s 2004 opinion in People v. Lee… It is common sense that the legislature would provide greater punishment for crimes it deems more serious. Here, the legislature has classified aggravated battery with a firearm as a Class X felony with a possible sentence of 6 to 30 years. Second degree murder is a Class 1 felony with a possible sentence of 4 to 20 years. Therefore, in line with Duszkewycz, the second degree murder conviction, as the less serious offense, should have been vacated. […] In sum, the appellate court erred in concluding that the more serious offense in this case was second degree murder simply because the court opted to impose a greater prison sentence on that count. Instead, aggravated battery with a firearm is the more serious offense, and defendant’s conviction for second degree murder must be vacated. * Judge Gaughan apparently agreed with the dissent in that case… Given this reality, it is simply impossible to say categorically, as the majority does, that all aggravated batteries are more serious than all second degree murders as a matter of law. Indeed, had the legislature felt this way, it would have created mutually exclusive sentencing ranges, with the maximum sentence for second degree murder falling somewhere below the minimum limit for aggravated battery with a firearm. But this is not what the legislature did. On the contrary, it created broad and largely overlapping sentencing ranges, leaving it to the trial court’s discretion to evaluate and ascertain the seriousness of these and other offenses on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, I would look to the sentences actually imposed in a given case when identifying the most serious offense. […] The bottom line is that, in this case, the trial court clearly believed that this particular second degree murder was more serious than this particular aggravated battery with a firearm. The legislature specifically allowed for this result, and I see no compelling reason to set it aside. I therefore dissent on this point. Some thought should be given to appealing Van Dyke’s sentence.

https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-01-24/democrats-biden-black-voters-criminal-justice,Biden’s push for voting rights failed. Will another promise to Black voters fall short?,"With the push for federal voting rights legislation blocked in Congress, President Biden is facing mounting pressure from civil rights groups to enact new criminal justice policies — or risk failing to deliver another key promise to Black voters.

Activists had hoped the momentum from the nationwide outrage over George Floyd’s killing by a police officer, and the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, a woman of color with deep experience in law enforcement, would set the stage for long-desired changes, including easier prosecution of police misconduct and limiting their immunity from civil lawsuits.

But with legislative efforts languishing in Congress and little public engagement by the White House, Democrats are in danger of disappointing a crucial voting bloc in the run-up to the midterm election.

“If we don’t see movement, we’re facing an uphill battle in turnout, in motivation,” said Aimee Allison, who heads She the People, a national network that focuses on turning out women of color in swing states to vote.

But as the calls for a win on criminal justice ramp up, so does the political challenge for Democrats. Violent crime has surged in cities across the country. Although the overall picture is mixed, with some property crimes declining, recent incidents such as shootings of on-duty police officers, smash-and-grab robberies and assaults on Asian Americans have propelled public safety to a top concern of voters. Even mayors of progressive meccas such as San Francisco are proposing more policing in response.

Politics News Analysis: Biden is stuck with a divided party Biden knew his voting rights push was unlikely to succeed, yet felt he had to plunge ahead in the face of pressure from activists and other Democrats.

The current environment makes many politicians wary of appearing to scale back law enforcement. Though most Democrats have not sought to cut police budgets, Republicans have eagerly linked them to the “defund the police” movement supported by some activists, in a bid to portray the party’s efforts to overhaul law enforcement practices as a risk to public safety.

“Unfortunately, the Democrats have become associated with the sort of soft on crime approach … which I think has really hurt them,” said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress who studies demographic and polling trends.

The party now finds itself squeezed by both sides in the debate. GOP candidates are already on the airwaves hammering Democrats for fostering lawlessness, while prominent Black activists and media personalities are pressing Biden and Harris to follow through on campaign pledges.

“I hear the frustration, but let’s not deny the impact that we’ve had and agree also that there is a whole lot more work to be done and it is not easy to do,” Harris said in an interview last month with radio personality Lenard “Charlamagne tha God” McKelvey.

The voting rights loss may have motivated Biden to show some progress on criminal justice. A source familiar with the White House’s deliberations, requesting anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said the administration is considering an executive order that the president may sign imminently. Such orders, by their nature, are far less powerful than laws passed by Congress, but they can use federal funding to spur departments to improve training, recruitment and tracking of incidents.

“We need to deliver something in regards to police reform, so I am hopeful that the White House will act,” said Rep. Karen Bass, a Los Angeles Democrat running for mayor who, along with Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed for executive action after the attempt to negotiate a bill with Republicans failed last year.

Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Assn., credited the administration’s “robust engagement with law enforcement” on the issue, but declined to comment on the specifics of the negotiations.

Civil rights groups also predict a renewed effort, either through executive actions or narrowly focused legislation.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a greater energy around this topic as we get closer and closer to the midterms,” said Jamie R. Riley, director of race and justice at the NAACP.

So far, however, the administration’s lack of major accomplishments has opened it to criticism that it hasn’t made reform enough of a priority.

“It’s been on the back burner. I don’t think there’s been a meaningful conversation about it,” said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of Democracy for America, a progressive advocacy group. She noted that even former President Trump had signed legislation to shorten federal prison sentences.

“What Biden has to do is be better than that,” she said. “He cannot walk away and do worse than Trump on criminal justice reform.”

For many Black voters, legislation to overhaul police practices is just as important as federal voting protections, said Aimy Steele, leader of the New North Carolina Project, which works to increase outreach and organization among voters of color.

“Why? Because the criminal justice act directly affects how Black and brown people interact with police,” Steele said.

In contrast to his highly visible championing of voting rights — which included a fiery speech delivered in Georgia — the president has not made a comparable effort to advance a criminal justice overhaul.

White House officials point to executive actions on this front, including ending contracts with private detention facilities and directing the U.S. Justice Department to enact restrictions on chokeholds and no-knock warrants for federal law enforcement.

A bill with a more sweeping overhaul of police practices — including banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants at the local level, and addressing “qualified immunity,” which shields law enforcement from most civil lawsuits — passed the Democrat-led House in the spring on a party-line vote.

But the measure, named the George Floyd Policing Act, died in the Senate last year after negotiations between Booker and Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, broke down. People involved in the talks, including Bass, see little chance of a revival heading into this year’s midterms, given the lack of incentive for Republicans to cooperate.

Biden publicly urged Congress to pass the legislation several times, including in his reaction when Derek Chauvin was convicted of Floyd’s murder in April. A White House official said Harris was involved behind the scenes — speaking with Booker as he negotiated with Scott — but agreed with others involved in the discussions that she and Biden deliberately kept their public comments muted to give senators room to seek a deal.

Criminal justice is not part of Harris’ public portfolio, a conspicuous absence given her experience as a prosecutor and California’s attorney general. Some of her allies see this as a missed opportunity, both to advance the cause and to improve her political standing after a wobbly first year as vice president.

Harris has struggled throughout her career to navigate the thorny politics of criminal justice. She worked hard to win over skeptical police groups in California for her statewide campaigns, but she was also hammered by progressives for not doing enough to address over-incarceration and police violence. Her presidential campaign was never clear whether it considered her prosecutorial past a selling point or a liability.

The Democratic Party as a whole finds itself walking a similar tightrope on the issue.

Politics As Kamala Harris takes criticism, Democrats in a bind as they look to 2024 and 2028 Kamala Harris’ former status as a prohibitive favorite as the party choice to succeed President Biden has taken a hit amid criticism of her as vice president. But denying her the job could create problems for Democrats with two key constituencies — Black and female voters.

Some Democratic political operatives argue that the broader swath of voters needed in the midterm election — including many Black voters — care most about the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on healthcare, schools and the economy.

“That’s what’s affecting their lives now. Can my kids go to school? Can I go to work?” said Joel Benenson, who served as a pollster and strategist for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, Democrats are facing a more complicated political task: continue to demonstrate support for some accountability measures — which remain popular, according to polls — without appearing oblivious to the nationwide increase in violent crime.

The party’s underperformance in 2020 House races set off a fierce intraparty debate over whether Republican attacks linking them to “defund the police” were a political albatross.

Some prominent Democrats have pointedly stepped up their emphasis on public safety. New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer known at the time for criticizing his department’s practices, centered his mayoral campaign on public safety. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has called for increased policing in the city’s troubled Tenderloin neighborhood and clashed with the city’s progressive district attorney.

Simpson, of Democracy for America, acknowledged that politicians are under pressure to look tough on crime, but said that shouldn’t stop the work to address police misconduct.

“What we need to do is reset the conversation, separating safety from police accountability,” she said. “Everybody wants to be safe — Black, white, rich, poor. That shouldn’t cost Black and brown lives.”",Q1
https://www.breitbart.com/news/in-1st-op-ed-since-leaving-office-obama-calls-for-end-of-filibuster-to-pass-voting-rights-bill/,Obama Calls for End of Filibuster to Pass Voting Rights Bill,"Jan. 13 (UPI) — In his first opinion piece since he left office five years ago, former President Barack Obama on Thursday strongly encouraged Democratic lawmakers in the Senate to make changes to the filibuster rule so that the upper chamber can pass stalled voting rights legislation.

The legislation, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, passed the House last summer but has failed to pass in the Senate, where Democrats have a slim one-vote majority.

President Joe Biden has also called for changes to the filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes in the Senate to pass a piece of legislation.

In his op-ed published in USA Today, Obama says he fully supports Biden’s call to modify Senate rules “to make sure pending voting rights legislation gets called for a vote.”

Obama said American democracy is not a given, and isn’t self-executing. It must be nurtured, he said, by citizens.

The 44th president lauded Lewis’ life work and noted that the Senate filibuster has no place in the U.S. Constitution. He added that the filibuster has been used only sparingly throughout history, mostly by southern senators decades ago to block civil rights legislation.

“In recent years, the filibuster became a routine way for the Senate minority to to block important progress on issues supported by the majority of voters,” he wrote. “But we can’t allow it to be used to block efforts to protect our democracy.”

Obama’s call comes amid a historic rise of legislation in numerous Republican-led states to make voting more difficult — mainly as a response to former President Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election and his false claims of voter fraud.

Obama said in his op-ed that lawmakers in 49 states have introduced more than 400 bills “designed to suppress votes.” He also said Republicans are using aggressive gerrymandering to tilt the playing field in their favor — and states are trying to assert power over core election processes, including the ability to certify election results.

Obama called on the Senate to “do the right thing” at a time when America’s democracy is being tested.

“These partisan attempts at voter nullification are unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times, and they represent a profound threat to the basic democratic principle that all votes should be counted fairly and objectively,” he wrote.

“The good news is that the majority of American voters are resistant to this slow unraveling of basic democratic institutions and electoral mechanisms. But their elected representatives have a sacred obligation to push back as well – and now is the time to do it.”",Q1

During a long-winded monologue against the GOP, Keilar declared:

The Big Lie is a cancer. So how do you cut it out without killing the patient? Is it even possible? As it metastasizes in one Republican-led state legislature after another. Thirty-four new laws in at least 19 states according to the Brennan Center that restrict voting access that could disproportionately affect voters of color. In particular legislatures in competitive states are making it harder to cast a ballot. And key Republicans are gaslighting America.

As Keilar delivered her diatribe, CNN put up a map of states that had supposedly passed these laws. Of the 19 states, one was dark blue New York, while others, like Kentucky, have Democratic governors. In April 2021, CNN's own website said Kentucky's law expanded voter access and even some of Keilar's own colleagues don't agree with her or the liberal Brennan Center on the impact of the other states' laws. The idea that Republicans are undermining voting rights could be said to be the media's own Big Lie.

Not deterred by such facts, Keilar played a clip of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell from March 2021 declaring, ""States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters whatsoever."" After the clip, Keilar asserted that ""Saying it doesn't make it true.""

There are thousands of elected offices throughout the country, but Keilar claimed that the sky is falling because, ""According to a Washington Post tally at least 163 Big Lie Republicans are running for state or national office.""

Keilar eventually turned to redistricting, which is another way Republicans are supposedly threatening democracy:

Meanwhile, state legislatures dominated by Republicans are drawing congressional maps that look like amoebas. Gerrymandering their states into congressional seats that are easy for their party to hold on to. Republicans control the redistricting process in states that oversee 187 House seats. Democrats control the process in states that oversee just 75 seats. Ohio's state supreme court struck down the congressional map proposed by Republicans just this past Friday saying the way it was drawn was like a dealer stacking the deck.

If Keilar thought Ohio's map was bad, just wait until she sees what Illinois Democrats came up with.

A dedicated firefighter was gunned down in a mystery attack as he helped tackle an early morning blaze.

Captain Max Fortuna, 47, was shot while battling a fire in a bin in California on Monday.

The dad-of-two was rushed to hospital in Stockton, between San Francisco and Sacramento, but sadly died of his injuries six hours later.

Robert Somerville, 67, was later arrested by police and charged with murder.

The force say that a motive was ""not immediately clear"" after taking the suspect into custody, where he remains.

Police posted a photo of the gun used in the shooting online as officers say they do not know if he was randomly or deliberately shot.

Tragic Fortuna, a married father of two children, was a member of the department for more than 20 years.

“Max was the type of firefighter that showed up every day and never complained about his job,” Stockton Firefighters 456 Union president Mario Gardea told KXTV.

“I don’t know many other firefighters who enjoy their job as much as he did.”

A flag at Stockton City Hall was flown at half mast as the city’s mayor Kevin Lincoln said his death was a huge loss to the community.

“Please join me in praying for the family of Captain Max Fortuna and our Stockton firefighter community, as we grieve this loss,” he tweeted.

“This is a sobering reminder of the sacrifices our public safety personnel make daily to protect and serve our community.”

An online fundraiser set up by the firefighters union for his family surpassed $34,000 today.

“It is a devastating loss for his wife, two children, family and our fire department,” the page reads.

The firefighter also volunteered at a church at Big Valley Grace Community Church.

They shared a tribute to him on their Facebook page.

“Max was a gentle and humble man who loved God and exhibited many characteristics of Christ,” the post reads.

“He served faithfully for many years and always brought his joyful attitude and strong work ethic to our ministry. He will be dearly missed.”",Q1

Jajuan R. Henderson, 29, was getting the drink from a Saturn Ion parked outside of his home shortly after midnight on Feb. 12 in Trenton, per the civil suit filed Wednesday in Mercer County.

That’s when a group of men in dark clothing and masks driving an unidentified vehicle boxed in the Saturn, which was parallel parked, according to the lawsuit. Henderson did not know who the men were.

Once out of their vehicle, the men began yelling and Henderson then attempted to use his phone to call for help, the suit said.

One of the men smashed the driver’s side window and Henderson was shot four times, the lawsuit said.

“This group of men, appearing as any other group of dangerous criminals from a horror movie, turned out to be from the Trenton Police Department,” the lawsuit said.

“A Black man sitting in a car at midnight while on a cell phone was all the unidentified police needed to smash the driver’s side window. Despite being unarmed, nonthreatening, and minding his own business, the police proceeded to use lethal force and shoot Jajuan in the neck. It is a miracle Jajuan survived.”

Henderson is now paralyzed from the chest down, the suit said.

Named as defendants are the city of Trenton, the director of Trenton police, Steve E. Wilson, and four officers only identified by their initials who were on scene.

Wilson did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. A city spokesperson declined comment on the lawsuit, citing the “pending litigation.”

Derek Demeri, an attorney representing Henderson, told NBC News on Friday there are many unknowns in the case, such as the plain-clothed officers’ objective that night.

According to the suit, there is body camera footage that has not been released to the public. The identities of the responding officers have also been withheld, the suit said.

A 2018 attorney general directive says video footage should be released publicly, when requested, once the initial use-of-force is substantially complete — usually within 20 days, NJ.com reported.

“It’s very frustrating. The family has a right to transparency in this process,” Demeri said.

A Trenton spokesperson, Tim Carroll — speaking on behalf of the city and police department — declined to comment beyond saying an investigation was ongoing.

“The City of Trenton has fully complied with the required Attorney General’s review of the February 12 incident, and await the findings,” Carroll said.

The state Attorney General’s Office has deferred a separate probe into the officers’ actions to the Union County Prosecutor’s Office because of a conflict of interest, the Mercer County prosecutor’s spokesperson said.

Demeri said in addition to being paralyzed, Henderson was charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest and obstruction of justice. The aggravated assault charges, four counts, were eventually dropped by the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office, Demeri said.

A spokesperson with the prosecutor’s office said Friday the office is still prosecuting Henderson for resisting arrest and obstruction. The spokesperson did not elaborate on why the aggravated assault charges were dismissed.

An affidavit filed against Henderson provided by Mercer prosecutors details the police perspective on what preceded the shooting.

The affidavit said that Trenton police’s street crime units, 511 and 513, attempted to conduct a motor vehicle stop on the Saturn the night of the incident.

Henderson, the affidavit said, refused to cooperate with detectives’ orders to roll down the window and then exit the vehicle. He also could not provide a driver’s license or proof of the Saturn’s registration and insurance, the affidavit said.

Henderson’s lawsuit said the car belonged to the mother of his child.

Henderson also refused orders to stop reaching under the backseat, which prompted an officer to break the driver’s window, the affidavit said. Henderson then, according to the affidavit, turned on the ignition and attempted to flee, striking two parked cars while officers were in close proximity.

Henderson’s lawsuit said it’s unclear if he turned on the ignition, but fleeing was impossible, given the car was boxed in between vehicles on three sides with a fourth side blocked by a utility pole on the car’s passenger side.

No officers were injured. The four officers were placed on administrative leave, according to a county prosecutor’s statement from last month.

Demeri said Henderson is a fighter who is working through rehabilitation and trying to gain mobility. But he has a long road ahead.

Given the circumstances, Demeri said his client acted like most people would.

“Anyone in that situation would be very frightened for their life.”",Q1

https://catholicphilly.com/2022/03/news/national-news/detroit-area-ukrainians-see-history-repeating-itself/,Detroit-area Ukrainians see history repeating itself,"WARREN, Mich. (CNS) — Michigan’s Ukrainian American population, which numbers around 46,000, has reacted to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with a mixture of disbelief, fear and sorrow.

“All of our hearts are breaking. I have no words, I don’t know how to express myself; it is just sadness, sorrow, anger,” Vera Murha told Detroit Catholic, the online news outlet of the Detroit Archdiocese.

“My parents went through this many years ago (during World War II), and for us to be going through now is unimaginable,” she said.

[hotblock]

Murha was among Ukrainian Americans who joined other community members at St. Josephat Ukrainian Catholic Church in Warren the evening of Feb. 24 for an emergency rally, anxious about their family and friends and doing their part to spread awareness about the suffering taking place at home.

Early morning the same day, detachments from Russia’s invasion force attacked Ukraine, triggering harsh resistance from Ukraine’s 200,000-strong armed forces and a huge refugee exodus.

On March 1, Russian troops continued to pound Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and a 40-mile column of Russian tanks and vehicles was closing in on Kyiv, the capital.

Like many others present at the rally in Warren, Murha has family still living in Ukraine, with whom she spoke earlier in the day. She said they were in Kyiv, awaiting evacuation.

“I want to say that we need to pray for them, but they need more than prayers right now; they need financial help. They need all of our support. They need to know that we are behind them,” Murha said.

Murha not only can’t imagine what her parents would think, but, she said, gesturing to the crowd, many young Ukrainian children are now being exposed to the unthinkable.

Bearing the Ukrainian colors of blue and yellow, holding signs of protest and calling for peace, local political and faith leaders led the rally, standing outside in the freezing cold.

Speaking from a podium were U.S. Rep. Andy Levin, a Democrat who represents Michigan’s 9th Congressional District and serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Warren Mayor Jim Fouts and members of the Ukrainian American community.

They expressed their support for Ukraine and their disdain for the invasion and shared stories of their own family heritage, often addressing the crowd in Ukrainian.

“(Russian President Vladimir Putin is) overrunning that country, which is a sovereign nation; it is a people with their language, their own culture, their own history,” Levin said. “This is the biggest land invasion since World War II.”

[tower]

“My message to our beautiful Ukrainian American community here is that we are united, we stand with you all,” he said, “and our allies will put a vice grip of sanctions on the Russian economy and will fight to do what it takes to restore the full territorial integrity of Ukraine.”

The last-minute event was organized by the Ukrainian-American Crisis Response Team in Detroit, a grassroots group of Ukrainian Americans formed to respond to escalating crises in Ukraine in recent years. The group also helped organize relief efforts after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Romana Petryshyn attended the rally with her three young children. Petryshyn was born and raised in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk.

She told Detroit Catholic the local airport had been bombed and her grandparents and her husband’s entire extended family were still there, scared and with packed bags.

“My oldest one is almost 7, so he understands now. He asked questions about Putin and about what’s going on,” Petryshyn said. “We talk about Russian aggression and how it has been a thing for years, for centuries. So he knows where this is coming from.

“That’s the reason we came here today with the kids; we know they are young, but we are leading by example. We have to support our people back home and everyone here.”

Older Ukrainians told Detroit Catholic it is unfathomable to witness the same tragedy their parents suffered — and escaped from — decades ago.

Janet Tymczenko-Zuyus, who was born in Germany following World War II, said her father had suffered under both communism and the threat of Nazi Germany.

As a 5-year-old, he watched his own father shot in the head by the Soviets for being part of the resistance. As a young man, he was made to leave his university in Kyiv to serve as a Soviet soldier and was eventually captured by the Germans. He survived and managed to escape, eventually ending up in a displaced person’s camp, where he met Tymczenko-Zuyus’ mother.

Tymczenko-Zuyus said her father, who suffered from PTSD for his entire life, would be heartbroken.

“The only reason I am glad that my parents are not here is because of what is going on here right now,” Tymczenko-Zuyus said. “They would just die all over again, it would be too painful for them.”

Tymczenko-Zuyus said her own heart breaks — Ukrainians have been through hell before, she said.

“Ukrainians have suffered, and are still now, and all they want is to be free people and live in democracy,” she said.

Alongside the many Ukrainian Americans were supporters from other East European countries. Polish American Samantha Marecki said her own country has suffered, and she has great empathy as she watches Ukraine come under attack.

Young people such as herself have been instrumental in spreading awareness, particularly through social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, she said.

“Using social media is a great way to allow other people to get educated and learn what is going on,” Marecki said. “(Also), call Congress, call anyone who is in a position of power that you think will help. Every word you say matters.”

Even several Russians were present at the rally, speechless at the destruction and evil coming from their home country.

“My paternal grandfather is from Ukraine, but I am a Russian citizen and I have lived for 20 years in the United States. I absolutely feel speechless about what is happening,” Olga Grushko tearfully told Detroit Catholic. “Ukraine has the full support of those Russians who are pro-democracy. There are a lot of people who sympathize who don’t want Putin in power, who want him out and think he is destroying Russia.”

Grushko said that while there have been protests among Russians, many Russians who speak out in their home country have been silenced or arrested.

News reports said police in Russia have arrested more than 2,000 anti-war protesters across the country.

“My heart goes to those (in Ukraine),” Grushko said. “I have been following Ukraine politics a little bit, and I felt so proud because they came from the same background of the Soviet Union, and they have been building their democracy.”

“I just feel proud, and I know they have something to fight for,” she added. “I believe that they have what it takes to fight for their freedom.”

Ascend Elements has announced that it will produce premium cathode active materials made from recycled lithium-ion batteries and scrap for federal contractor Navitas Systems. According to the contract it recently entered into with Navitas Systems, Ascend Elements will deliver the cathode active materials and scrap to Navitas in April 2022 which will be in a Department of Defense project. This is the first commercial sale of cathode active materials made with the company’s patented Hydro-to-Cathode™ technology.

Michael O’Kronley, CEO and Director of Ascend Elements, gave the following statement.

“We see this as a milestone for the lithium-ion battery industry. With this agreement, Ascend Elements and Navitas will demonstrate how our Hydro-to-Cathode process elevates the value of recycled battery materials by transforming them into premium cathode active materials to be utilized in manufacturing new lithium batteries. Testing to date indicates the material performs as well as or, in some cases, even better than virgin cathode materials.

“Our relationship with Navitas Systems will also demonstrate how battery materials suppliers, battery manufacturers, and the U.S. government can collaborate to produce sustainable cathode materials here in the United States, ultimately helping address national security and energy independence concerns, as most critical metals are currently sourced from foreign countries.”

Les Alexander, Vice President of Government, Defense and R&D at Navitas Systems, shared thoughts about the contract as well.

“We’re looking forward to assessing how our mission-critical applications for the Department of Defense, including batteries for hybrid vehicles and other military equipment, can be well-served by Ascend Elements. Their ability to take recycled batteries and create high-performance cathode active materials holds the potential for us to source locally and securely, which is a priority for our customers. We’re pleased to be one of the first to demonstrate a circular lithium-ion battery economy here in the U.S.”

Marc Gietter, Chairman of the Military Power Sources Committee of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), noted that this joint effort was a major first step in solving problems with the growth in usage of lithium-ion batteries.

“The joint effort between Navitas and Ascend Elements is a major first step in solving several problems in the continued growth in usage of lithium-ion batteries. First, it helps demonstrate the potential to minimize the waste stream related to the disposal of these batteries, and, second, and probably more important, it is a significant milestone towards ultimately reducing the U.S. military’s reliance on foreign-sourced supply chain components.”",Q1

Close encounter came after a commotion on porch on Road 24; trap is set

A mountain lion reportedly attacked a 47-year-old man Sunday at his residence on County Road 24 west of Lebanon in Montezuma County, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

About 6:30 p.m., Michael D. Warren sustained several puncture wounds to his lower right leg from a reported mountain lion attack, according to a CPW news release from public information officer John Livingston.

CPW was trying to locate the mountain lion as of Thursday morning.

“This is an ongoing investigation,” said CPW District Wildlife Manager Matt Sturdevant. “We are still looking into it, and want to make sure we get the right offending lion. Any help from the surrounding area and the public would be helpful.”

A live trap was set to capture the lion. If captured, the lion would be euthanized because it injured a human, Livingston said.

Warren said he was in his home when he heard a thud on his front porch, and his dogs inside the house began barking aggressively. He believed his domestic cats might be fighting on the porch, so he went outside to investigate.

Warren said he opened the door to his porch and placed his right leg in the opened door while he tried to keep his dogs inside the house. Shortly after he placed his leg between the open door and the porch, he felt something grab his leg. He looked and said he saw a mountain lion run away. Security camera footage later confirmed his mountain lion sighting.

A close encounter with wildlife

“It was a shock and happened so fast, not something you expect when you step onto your porch,” Warren said when contacted by The Journal. “It just grabbed and latched its claws onto my leg. Luckily my dogs were right behind me and chased it off.”

He said another piece of luck was that he was wearing blue jeans and long johns, which minimized the injury.

Security camera video shows a medium-size mountain lion bolting through a porch screen with Warren’s dogs, Daisy and Harley, chasing after it. Warren and his friend chased after the dogs, and called them back as the lion fled across Road 24.

Warren has seen mountain lions in the area and suspects the one he encountered killed two of his cats, Tom and Wiggles, one of which he has had for 10 years.

“I feel bad because the front porch is supposed to be their safe area. My other two cats are skittish now, I’m trying to get them to stay inside,” he said.

Warren said he appreciates wildlife and realizes his home is in mountain lion territory. But he feels when one becomes brave enough to come up onto a porch of a home and attacks pets and people, it should be put down.

“I hope it is caught, it does not seem to be deterred,” he said.

Warren said he has some uncertainty now stepping out onto his porch, or leaving his house.

He has installed motion detectors and cameras that send alerts to his phone so he can monitor what is going on.

“I’m keeping an eye out,” Warren said.

Warren called police dispatch to report the attack. He told dispatch that he did not want medical treatment for the several punctures on his leg.

CPW made attempts to locate the mountain lion throughout Sunday evening. Officers again responded to the area the morning of Feb. 28 and resumed the site investigation. They also used hound dogs trained specifically to track mountain lions, but they did not find the mountain lion.

“The strength of the scent had deteriorated,” said Area Wildlife Manager Adrian Archuleta.

CPW used the hounds in coordination with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

The trap and game cameras were placed at the location of the incident. The trap was baited with a piece of roadkill deer.

The cameras and DNA evidence collected at the scene would be used to determine whether the captured lion was the offender, Archuleta said.

Warren had four domestic cats. Two recently went missing, leading CPW to believe the mountain lion previously visited the location and returned the night of the attack.

Another mountain lion incident was reported Feb. 18 to CPW from the same area after it preyed on chickens and a cat.

“Judging by the tracks we found and the footage we have along with the victim’s statement, we believe it is a young, subadult lion,” Sturdevant said. “We also believe it is the same lion that had been hanging out in the area for a bit.”

Archuleta said lion attacks on people are rare, but when a person is injured, the animal is “typically euthanized for human health and safety,” he said.

If captured and euthanized, the animal would be tested for disease, Archuleta said.

Southwest Colorado is good mountain lion habitat, he said. Lions can be attracted to easy meals around homes.

CPW advises residents to help prevent run-ins with lions by reducing attractants such as pet food outside the home. Residents also are advised to secure chicken and livestock pens with electric fencing, use guard dogs for grazing animals and turn on exterior lights.

“If a lion is seen in proximity to homes, make it feel unwelcome,” Archuleta said.

Yell at it, bang pots and pans, turn on outdoor lights, use your key fob to trigger your car horn. Also, avoid attracting deer to your property because they are the main prey of mountain lions.

It is illegal to shoot a mountain lion without a hunting tag unless it is attacking you or is about to attack you.

Sunday night’s incident is the first reported mountain lion attack of a human in Colorado since March 11, 2020, and the first attack in Southwest Colorado since 2008.

It is the 23rd known attack of a mountain lion causing injury to a human in Colorado since 1990.

Three other attacks in Colorado since 1990 have resulted in human deaths. CPW does not characterize lion depredation of pets or other animals as attacks.

Although mountain lion attacks are rare, it is important to know how to avoid or manage potential encounters. To learn more about living with mountain lions in Colorado, go to https://cpw.state.co.us/lions

https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/13/how-an-anti-trump-resistance-manifesto-actually-indicts-the-covid-tyrants/,How An Anti-Trump Resistance Manifesto Actually Indicts COVID Tyrants,"My perspective on life changed dramatically in 2016. As an institutional Democrat, somebody who has worked in Democratic politics since 2000, I assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election.

The election of Donald Trump shocked me. So did the response to it. Many people compared Trump’s election to that tumultuous period that led to the Second World War. Many viewed Trump as a threat to democracy. Some wrote books about this. One stood out: “On Tyranny,” a 126-page tome written by Yale University historian Timothy Snyder and published in 2017 as a manifesto to the anti-Trump resistance.

“On Tyranny” provides 20 lessons from the world’s experience fighting tyrannical regimes during the 20th century. It does that through an anti-Trump lens that is only quietly masked. For example, when discussing election security, Snyder suggested Trump might cancel the 2018 elections. Of course, that did not happen.

Although Snyder provided an excellent analysis of factors that led to the rise of tyrannical regimes during the last century — whether Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or the communist governments in Eastern Europe after the war — those lessons are more valuable now than they ever were during Trump’s presidency. Indeed, many of the warning signs Snyder flagged in “On Tyranny” are readily apparent today, during the never-ending Covid-19 emergency, but Trump-hating leftists in the government, media, and corporate America are ignoring them.

Too many regular Americans are ignoring these warning signs too, even as the signs indicate that the government controls enacted to fight the Covid-19 virus really threaten America as we know it. Here are some of the warning signs of tyranny from Snyder’s book that clearly apply to the Covid response.

Do Not Obey in Advance

The most important lesson is the book’s first one: Do not obey in advance.

Snyder emphasized that “[m]ost of the power of authoritarianism is freely given.” Indeed, Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram found that, if told to do so by an authority figure, people were surprisingly willing to inflict pain on others.

The authority figure in Milgram’s experiment was a doctor (Milgram) who told people to administer fatal doses of electrical shocks to a person in an adjacent room (actually an actor pretending to be shocked). As Snyder explained, “most subjects followed Milgram’s instructions and continued to apply (what they thought were) even greater shocks until the victims appeared to die.”

We see echoes of Milgram’s experiment in the response to Covid-19. Decent people have shown an incredible callousness toward those who do not follow the rules, whether by eschewing masks (which many studies have shown do not work and may cause harm) or not getting one of the Covid-19 shots (ditto). They say they are happy to see these people die.

Sadly, they are the ones to blame. Like Milgram’s subjects, they made the cardinal sin of obeying in advance simply because a doctor (in this case Tony Fauci and others like him) told them to.

Defend Institutions and Free Discourse

Snyder’s second lesson rivals the first in significance: Defend institutions.

While human minds are malleable in times of adversity, America’s institutions are supposed to remain strong. Snyder summarized this point well: “It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. … So choose an institution you care about — a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor union — and take its side.”

Many people did that in response to Trump’s election. For example, California filed more than 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration. Most of them were grounded in administrative law, which requires that the executive/administrative branch of government engage in a reasonable decision-making process when making policy. Democratic and Republican judges alike struck down Trump policies.

Now, however, many judges have refused to question Covid-19 restrictions because the government said it issued them to protect public health. They resurrected a 117-year-old Supreme Court decision, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, that was issued when Plessy v. Ferguson was good law, to boot hundreds of litigants out of court. They seem to have little interest in truth, as Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer showed when spewing misinformation about Covid-19 during last week’s Supreme Court arguments.

Meanwhile, much of the press has operated as a public relations agency for left-leaning governments and bureaucrats. They do not question the government’s Covid policies but promote them as gospel, labeling any dissent “misinformation” that should be censored.

The censorship of Covid-19 dissent rivals the courts’ apathy as the pandemic’s most chilling development. James Madison listed the freedom of speech first in the Bill of Rights for a reason. Snyder recognized the importance of discourse too, explaining in his book: “You submit to tyranny when you renounce the difference between what you want to hear and what is actually the case.”

We have never needed robust debate more than we do right now. But instead of embracing debate, many Americans are cracking down on dissent, as Twitter did when it banned Dr. Robert Malone. Another Big Tech titan, YouTube, also suppressed Joe Rogan’s interview with Malone.

Fortunately, America’s institutions may soon strike back. The Supreme Court seems ready to rule against some of the Biden administrations’ vaccine mandates. Voters will head to the polls this year and seem poised to give the Republicans a congressional majority.

Remember Professional Ethics

Speaking of doctors, Snyder’s demand that people “remember professional ethics” should also strike a chord. “It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without judges.”

Lawyers, doctors, and journalists all have explicit ethical rules guiding their professions. The field of medical ethics grew out of the atrocities committed during the Second World War, but it was not limited to Germany. Few remember that forced medical treatments were widely accepted during the early 20th century. By the time the century ended, federal law and many states recognized a right to refuse medical treatment, including life-saving treatment, and doctors championed the doctrine of informed consent.

Legal ethics has a longer history that focuses on the importance of due process and on encouraging lawyers to take on unpopular cases. Former Solicitor General Paul Clement emphasized this when he left his law firm in 2011 because it would not let him defend the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, saying flatly: “Defending unpopular positions is what lawyers do.”

The legal community praised Clement but has shown little support for the lawyers fighting government restrictions during the Covid-19 era. Some judges seem to view these lawyers and their clients as wanting to kill people. They should reconsider that and instead focus on their professional obligations.

I often hear people (lawyers and doctors especially) say that sure, they support freedom and due process — but it’s a pandemic! They should know better. As Snyder says: “Professional ethics must guide us precisely when we are told the situation is exceptional.”

Stand Out and Be Courageous

“On Tyranny” has many other excellent lessons. I urge you to read it and to think about how those lessons are playing out today, two years into a pandemic that many governments won’t let end.

As you do that, consider two of Snyder’s most important lessons: standing out and being courageous. “It is those who were considered exceptional, eccentric, or even insane in their own time,” he noted, “those who did not change when the world around them did — whom we remember and admire today.”

HOOD RIVER COUNTY, Oregon (KPTV) — Oregon State Police say a sergeant’s quick thinking stopped a wrong-way driver and possibly saved lives.

On March 18, at about 6 p.m., OSP said it received several complaints about a white Ford Mustang driving erratically on Interstate 84, eastbound from milepost 35. A Hood River County Sheriff’s Office deputy tried to stop the car and a pursuit ensued.

OSP said the driver in the Mustang continued to act erratically, so the deputy terminated the pursuit near milepost 60. The suspect driver was able to avoid at least two stop-stick deployments and continued east on I-84.

The suspect driver took Exit 82 into The Dalles where officers and troopers were stationed at the top of the exit. OSP said the driver turned around on the off-ramp and started to go the wrong way toward the eastbound lanes of I-84.

Sgt. Calloway, who was trying to catch up to the Mustang, took the exit and saw the vehicle going the wrong way. OSP said Sgt. Calloway intentionally collided with the Mustang to prevent it from getting on the interstate.

Thankfully, Sgt. Calloway only sustained minor injuries in the crash. He was treated and released from Providence Hood River Memorial Hospital.

OSP said the suspect was taken to Mid-Columbia Medical Center in The Dalles where he is being treated. The suspect, who has not yet been identified, is expected to be okay.

No additional details have been released at this time. OSP said The Dalles Police Department is leading the investigation.

Residence Hall,"A 39-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with murder in a stabbing inside a Lincoln University residence hall that court records indicate started as a fight and turned bloody and deadly.

Nydira Smith, 39, of Philadelphia, is charged with stabbing 21-year-old Jawine Evans to death, as well as stabbing two others who survived their wounds.

“This is a parent’s worst nightmare. This senseless and tragic incident is devastating to not only the families of the victims but the entire Lincoln University community – students, staff, and parents – who believed their college campus was a safe place,"" Chester County District Attorney Deb Ryan said in a written statement.

According to an affidavit of probable cause, police officers responded to the fight at the Chester County school on Feb. 16 around 9:14 p.m. and found Evans stabbed in the neck and arm in a grassy area outside a residence hall, where they also found the other, 22-year-old victims.

Evans died at the scene while the other two were rushed to Christiana Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, where they were treated and released.

When officers entered the first floor of the Thurgood Marshall Living Learning Center, they found blood spattered on the floor, walls and doors in front of dorm 114, according to the affidavit. They also found bloody footprints that led to a dorm on the third floor, where one of the stabbing victims resided.

Cellphone video showed multiple men – including the three who were stabbed – and two women – including Smith, fighting outside room 114, the affidavit indicated. One of the students involved in the fight was Smith's brother.

Security video from the front of the school showed a maroon Infiniti arriving on campus at 9:07 p.m., the affidavit said. The stabbing happened at 9:14.

Campus police chief Marc Partee said during a Thursday press conference that Smith was able to enter the campus because she was the family member of a student, verified the student's information, showed ID and said she was going to pick up the student.

""My husband and I are devastated over the loss of our beloved son Jawine,"" Evans' mother, Beverly Evans, said in a written statement issued through Bruce Castor, the lawyer representing the family.

""We thought he would be safe on the campus of Lincoln University, and never dreamed such a terrible thing could happen there. We’re stunned at the lax university security, but extremely grateful to Chester County law enforcement for catching Jawine’s killer, and for DA Ryan’s comments showing she is taking a strong public stand to bring his killer to justice,"" Beverly Evans said.

The school will be evaluating its security procedures in light of the stabbing, Partee said.

Detectives traced the car back to Smith and found what appeared to be blood inside, the police document said. They also found blood-stained clothing matching what cellphone video showed Smith was wearing during the stabbing, as well as a knife missing from a knife block, according to the affidavit.

Smith was held in county jail without bail on murder charges. Online court records don't list an attorney who could comment on her behalf.

According to its website, Lincoln University was founded in 1854 as ""the nation's first degree-granting Historically Black College and University, or HBCU."" It is located in Chester County, Pennsylvania.

As of this past fall, 1,767 students were enrolled.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. We take the safety of our students seriously and are working with local authorities as there is an ongoing investigation,"" the university said in a statement shortly after the stabbing.",Q1

They also criticised the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) for registering hundreds of antibiotics and making them freely available without any prescription, saying hundreds of drug companies have hundreds of brands of antibiotics, whose excessive use has become a serious public health issue in Pakistan. “Easy availability of antibiotics is one of the most serious issues in Pakistan where people at pharmacies are selling these drugs like candies. Patients take these drugs for a day and two and when the symptoms of the disease are gone, they stop taking these antibiotics, making bacteria resistant to these drugs”, said Prof Dr Jamal Raza, a senior pediatrician while speaking at the sidelines of 17th Asia Pacific Congress of Pediatrics which concluded here on Sunday.

Hundreds of experts from various Europe, Middle East, Far East, Africa as well as United States, Australia and Canada as well as different cities of the country attended the international moot and presented their research papers on different health aspects of newborns, children and adolescents.

Terming antibiotic drugs as most important invention in the history of mankind that saved millions and millions of lives, health experts at the international moot recommended an immediate ban on the over the counter sale of antibiotics as it was leading to most serious issue of antimicrobial resistance as in case of XDR (Extensively Drug Resistant) Typhoid, which is resistant to most of the third generation antibiotics and has become a serious cause of concern for the public health experts.

Prof Jamal Raza maintained that over-registration of the antibiotics by the regulatory authorities was another reason behind misuse of antibiotics in Pakistan, saying hundreds of brands of these medicines were available and in order to sell them, sales staff of the drug companies use all kinds of tactics to meet their sale targets.

“There is an urgent need to promote rational and justifiable use of antibiotics so that these drugs could be used for a longer period of time unfortunately, even the latest antibiotics are proving ineffective against the bacteria due to their irrational and excessive use”, he deplored.

Another eminent pediatrician from Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Dr Asad Ali said excessive and irrational use of antibiotics was not only resulting in Antimicrobial Resistance in humans but it was particularly a dangerous practice in children where these drugs also kill their healthy or beneficial bacteria, causing serious health issues for the children.

“There are 10 times more bacteria in human body than its own cells and antibiotics are like a bomb, which kill all types of bacteria present in the human body. Irrational use of antibiotics in children deprive them of healthy flora, which result in serious health consequences for them”, Dr Asad Ali added. He maintained that ‘bacteria are living with human beings for over two billion years’ while humans have invented antibiotics in last few years so bacteria know how to make them resistant to these drugs to continue surviving in the human body and added that there is a need to limit the use of these life-saving drugs before they become completely ineffective. To a query, Dr Ali said most of the physicians and consultant pediatricians use antibiotics in good faith to save lives of children, adding that in case of meningitis and other life-threatening conditions, treating physicians don’t want to take risks and use whatever available to them to save lives of the children.

Several other experts at the international conference urged the authorities to take measures to prevent over the counter availability of prescription drugs especially antibiotics while they also urged their colleagues, including general physicians not to prescribe these drugs until and unless they are extremely important.",Q1

https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/american-families-need-paid-leave/,American Families Need Paid Leave,"“Hi honey, I have some news, I need you to sit down.” My husband’s words over the phone sent my heart racing. I knew this tone in his voice and it didn’t portend good things. I was in the middle of a work trip across the country when I learned that one of our children, who has a serious mental illness, had attempted suicide. Mercifully, our child was going to be okay, but I didn’t know that at first. I raced back to the hospital bedside filled with sickening worry and deep sadness for our hurting child.

Unbelievably, exactly one week later, another of our children, also with serious mental illness, woke me from a deep sleep at midnight with words I’ll never forget: “Mom, help me, I’m scared, I swallowed pills.” I scooped our child tightly into my arms, began silently praying, and called 911. We followed the ambulance and found ourselves in the very same hospital, same floor, same room, different child, one week later. Mercifully, the second child also survived the attempt.

I cried to the behavioral health clinician who came by to see how we were doing. Not well. “I don’t know what to do, our kids are so sick.” I felt despondent and cried out to God for help and healing and strength. It’s hard to describe this level of fear and hopelessness. I wanted to crawl under the covers and not come out. But my kids needed me. And I still needed to work.

Because of their early trauma in the foster care system and serious mental illness in their birth families, our kids needed significant extra care and professional services. All of it took a great deal of time and energy. They also needed me to keep my good job to pay the bills. Raising four kids, three of whom had extreme medical needs, was expensive. Juggling work and family felt impossible. My kids needed me with them, and they needed me to work because it takes money to live and eat.

Unfortunately, the dark time described above was just one week of a 13-year, non-stop journey of the same type—hospitalizations, doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, special pharmacies, residential treatment facilities. It all just kept coming while I was trying to work to make ends meet. Living in these extreme tensions brought severe strains to our marriage, our finances, and work-life balance. Only by God’s grace did we survive.

I and my husband needed help. A lot of help. One thing we really needed, but didn’t have, was paid family leave.

I worked at an organization with more than 50 employees, so we were fortunate to have the protections of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I could at least be assured I wouldn’t lose my job because I had to care for sick children. But while that was an incredible relief, it wasn’t enough. Taking unpaid leave meant that there wasn’t money coming in to support the same amount of bills taking the money out. So, we went into debt. It was an easy choice because there were no others.

Many people, however, can’t afford to take unpaid time off even if they are covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act, and many more don’t even have that option because its provisions don’t apply to them. Our family was among the lucky ones.

My job paid well, and my husband was retired from the Air Force. So, he was able to be home more to meet the unique caregiving responsibilities of having children with extreme illnesses. But not everyone can do that. Many people lose jobs, homes, retirements, relationships, and more because of the impossible challenge of trying to care for sick loved ones while keeping their jobs and paying their bills. Church community can help, but not to the extent families need. As a result, far too many in these situations are simply stuck. And the strain caused by these types of circumstances ruptures families and destroys lives.

It doesn’t have to stay this way. There’s a better way, and paid family leave is an essential component.

Maybe you’ve never been in this impossible position; be thankful. You likely will be at some point in your life. Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, founder of the Institute for Caregivers, said it well: “There are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, and those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.”

Whether it’s caring for a chronically ill or injured child, a spouse with a long-term illness, or aging or dying parents, juggling the realities of caregiving and work is a challenge faced every day by millions of Americans. This situation crosses all ideological, political, geographic, and faith boundaries. And when a challenge like this is such a common reality for millions of Americans, the ground is ripe for broad, bipartisan support for common sense solutions.

It seems cliché to mention the radical polarization plaguing our nation, but it’s real and it affects us all in our daily lives. Paid family leave, like parental leave, is an issue that should bring disparate groups together to advance the well-being of all American families and bring a modicum of unity along the way. Christians, especially, should be part of that conversation.

Evangelical, pro-family advocates have long supported the primacy of the family in public policy and the culture. From repealing the marriage penalty, to the child tax credit, to the family friendly ratings systems in popular culture, family friendly policies have been advanced because the family is the core institution of society. Its wellbeing affects churches, communities, states, and nations. The importance of family wellbeing is reflected in the multi-million-dollar, non-profit organizations that have encouraged people to focus on their families by prioritizing marriage and child rearing among competing priorities. Pro-life Christians have noted the importance of caring for elderly parents, rallied against a throwaway culture, and advocated for compassionate care.

All these commitments make pro-family advocates natural allies with their progressive neighbors who want our nation to make progress on paid family leave to help American families facing these deeply personal yet universal struggles.

One of the favorite quotes of pro-family advocates is from Mother Theresa: “What can you do to promote world peace?” She famously asked and answered. “Go home and love your family.” Paid family leave would enable countless more people to heed Mother Theresa’s words. And while there are many details to be determined to make it happen, evangelicals can help lead the way.

Many evangelicals express concern about the size and scope of government, but paid family leave solutions don’t need to break the bank. They do have to be prioritized, however, among competing interests. Evangelicals can help make that case. If family is as important as we know it is, the time is now to make progress in this area. It was a famous businessman, Walt Disney, who said “A man should never neglect his family for business.” Paid family leave can help make that possible for millions more American families.

Escambia County in 2020 clocked in a bit higher than the national murder rate, which itself spiked about 30%, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data, as the uncertainty of the pandemic, economic devastation and social unrest swept the nation.

“COVID-19 did not slow down the drug trade,” said Escambia County Sheriff Chip Simmons.

Escambia County closed out 2021 with a total of 28 homicides, the same number recorded in 2019 before the rate jumped by nearly 36% locally to 38 homicide deaths in 2020, according to vital statistics data from the Florida Department of Health.

For comparison, there were 19 homicides in 2018 and 27 such deaths in 2017.

In Escambia, firearms and drug activity go hand-in-hand in most cases.

“The vast majority of violent gun crimes that we see are drug-related or the result of risky behavior,” Simmons said.

Out of 28 homicides last year, public information officer Amber Southard confirmed four were considered justified.

“Some of the homicides reported are actually justified, and we don’t arrest people in homicides for defending themselves,” Simmons said.

Five of the cases from last year are still active.

Other gun violence generally occurs during domestic disputes and rarely between strangers. Simmons pointed out one violent incident can trigger other retaliatory events.

“The frustrating part to me is we have to talk to the victims' families and their neighborhoods, and you feel for what they’re going through,” Simmons said.

The Sheriff’s Office engages with the community through outreach initiatives, neighborhood association meetings and diversion programs to reach at-risk youth.

“Unfortunately, some people don’t want any part of that, and they continue down this dangerous path that ultimately ends up either getting them put in prison or in the ground,” Simmons said.

Only a few of the homicide cases each year fall into Pensacola Police Department’s jurisdiction. Mike Wood, PPD public information officer, echoed Simmons and said their homicide cases are mostly drug-related and domestic.

“Both of those are where firearms are used,” Wood said.

Wood added that there is no statistically reliable way to link violent crime that occurred in 2020 to the pandemic as the motives they encountered remained the same, and there wasn’t a spike in incidents during the period of lockdown.

While the FBI pointed out a definite increase in homicide deaths and violent crime nationally in 2020, the variables are different all over the map.

“We know that factors such as poverty and lack of education disproportionately impact certain communities, which also tend to experience higher rates of crime. We also know a small number of firearms dealers are responsible for selling the vast majority of guns used in violent crimes, and a small number of people and places are responsible for the vast majority of violence,” said Bryanna Fox, associate professor in the criminology department at the University of South Florida.

ECSO boosted efficiency in violent crime investigations by moving the gun crime unit to work more closely with the narcotics unit within the department’s major crimes division, as well as partnering with PPD and Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

Fox said that police alone cannot effectively intervene and solve problems related to violent crime.

“Research shows it is most effective to also partner with the community and service providers to help address the long- and short-term factors that are contributing to the increased level of violent crime,” Fox said.

What sometimes hampers investigations and law enforcement’s ability to clean up violent crime in Escambia is that victims sometimes refuse to talk or provide false narratives of circumstances around violent crimes, Simmons said.

“We are not giving up and taking anything lightly,” Simmons said. “If we get violence reported to us we will investigate it, and for those doing it our intention is to put them away for a long time.”",Q1

ATV businesses could be freed from regulation

In a last-minute move, the Senate passed an amended bill, HB 146 , to bar cities and counties in Utah from regulating ATV businesses. Sen. Curtis Bramble , R-Utah, introduced a broad amendment Tuesday to expand a House bill that originally pertained to food trucks. The legislation now strips the ability to enact many restrictions on ATVs, like limiting the number of them or revoking licenses based on traffic violations. While it affects the whole state, Grand County Attorney Christina Sloan said it targets Moab in particular. Local officials enacted restrictions on ATVs just last year in response to residents’ complaints, but those will be stripped away by the bill. In an interview with KZMU , Sloane said ATVs are a unique health risk in Moab and that Sen.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mumbai-pathankot-terror-attacks-victims-yet-to-get-justice-india-2759929,"Mumbai, Pathankot Terror Attacks Victims Yet To Get Justice: India","India has long borne the brunt of cross-border terrorism, with victims of the “dastardly” 2008 Mumbai terror attack and the 2016 Pathankot terror act, perpetrated by Pakistan-based terror groups, yet to get justice, New Delhi's envoy has told the UN Security Council.

Speaking in the Security Council briefing on ‘Threat to International Peace & Security Caused by Terrorist Acts' on Wednesday, Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti reiterated India's firm belief that terrorism in one part of the world is threat to peace and security of entire world.

He said that as a country that has long borne the brunt of cross-border terrorism, including the 2008 Mumbai terror attack and the 2016 Pathankot terror act, with victims of both these dastardly acts yet to get justice, “India is acutely aware of the human cost of terrorism and remains fully committed to bringing the perpetrators of these terror attacks to justice.” While condemning terror attacks, “our response should be unified, and unequivocal. We should not forget the fact that, even after 20 years of September 11 attacks, we have leaders who, without any remorse, continue to defend Osama Bin Laden as a martyr,” he said.

Mr Tirumurti was making a reference to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who had called the killed Al Qaeda chief a martyr.

Terrorists of Pakistan-based outfits Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) had carried out the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks and the January 2016 Pathankot airbase attack.

At the briefing, which took up Secretary General Antonio Guterres' 14th Report on Threat Posed by ISIL/Da'esh, Mr Tirumurti expressed heartfelt condolences to all the families of victims who lost their loved ones in recent terror attacks in Afghanistan, UAE, Iraq, Syria, Congo and Uganda.

Mr Tirumurti further told the Council that terrorism impacts everyone, irrespective of the place or origin.

“Unfortunately, it took us decades and then September 11 attacks, to come out of a flawed mindset of treating terrorism based on motivations behind terror acts,” he said.

He added that Security Council resolution 1566 of 2004 notes that terrorist acts are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature.

The resolution further underlines that terrorism seriously impairs the enjoyment of human rights and threatens social and economic development of all nations.

""It is essential that we keep this in mind as we look to further strengthen our counter terror architecture,” Mr Tirumurti said.

He voiced concern that today the terrorists' use of ICT, social media, emerging technologies such as new digital payment methods, encrypted messaging services, cryptocurrencies, crowdfunding platforms and Unmanned Aircraft Systems pose a “dynamic threat” for which most of the member states do not have adequate response capabilities.

“We have recently witnessed terror attacks through drones in our neighbourhood and now in UAE and Saudi Arabia, which have been condemned strongly by the Security Council. The recent Council resolution 2617 takes note of this threat posed by Unmanned Aircraft Systems. We need to work together to develop appropriate solutions and evolve global standards to address these threats,” he said.

In June last year, two drones dropped explosive material on the Indian Air Force station located at Jammu airport, injuring two personnel.

Lashkar-e-Taiba has been suspected to have been behind the drone attack. In August last year, a bomb-laden drone had targeted an airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia, wounding eight people and damaging a civilian plane.

In January this year, two Indians and a Pakistani national were killed and six others injured in a suspected Houthi drone attack near the Abu Dhabi airport.

Mr Tirumurti reiterated External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's 8-point action plan to combatting terrorism, including summoning political will and not justifying terrorism or glorifying terrorists, no double standards and no good or bad distinction being made and not placing blocks and holds on listing requests without reason.

Mr Tirumurti is currently Chair of the UN Counter Terrorism Committee (CTC) and said India will work closely with United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) and continue to take up this issue with all stakeholders so that a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism and its perpetrators becomes the norm of the international counter terror discourse.

https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2022/02/american_appeasement_of_russia_led_to_war_in_ukraine.html,American Appeasement of Russia Led to War in Ukraine,"As I write this, the first shells are exploding in Ukraine in what promises to be the bloodiest war in Europe since 1945. The most frustrating part is that this was all preventable. This was not an unseen, spontaneous natural disaster. The lessons of history are there for us to learn from, but the West has willfully ignored them. A long chain of appeasement that runs across administrations and countries has emboldened Putin and resurrected his dream of a revived Soviet Union.

It's important to understand the nature of Russia. For all intents and purposes, Russia is a dictatorship. Putin himself was a former KGB thug. He has the vast power of the government, economy, and media. Its ""elections"" are mere political theater. In 2011, massive crowds in Russia protested his rigged ""re-election."" The leading pro-democracy activist, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned by the Kremlin and now sits in jail. The Kremlin has killed former party members and dozens of journalists. The Russian government repeatedly sponsors cyber-attacks and has attempted to interfere with elections of Western countries. It supports dictators around the world, including in Iran, Syria, and Venezuela. In 2018, Russian mercenaries directly attacked U.S. forces in Syria. Now the world watches in horror as Putin's army launches an unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

Putin has begun all this for a couple of intertwined reasons: nationalism and power. He's said the collapse of the Soviet Union was ""a major geopolitical disaster of the century."" It is nationalism in the most primitive, tribal, Nazi-like form — the elevation of some mystical ""motherland"" above all rights of individuals, including Russians. Putin feels betrayed that the Ukrainians are increasingly sympathetic to the West, economically and spiritually. He wants to punish them and simultaneously send a message to his people. Freedom-loving people are a threat to his power. He sees former Soviet states like Poland, Romania, Lithuania, and others join the E.U. and become prosperous. Therefore, he tries to sow discontent in Western countries in any way he can. He can be seen then as the stable alternative and reassert Russia's sphere of influence. Because America is still seen as a symbol of freedom to people around the world, we are naturally his enemy.

So what have been the Wests' relations with Russia? Any discussion of this topic cannot leave out energy. Europe's pursuit of green energy has left it vulnerable to Russia. Forty percent of Europe's natural gas is supplied from Russia. This is a result of a combination of banning fracking in many countries, restricting imports of LNG (liquefied natural gas) combined with America restricting LNG exports, and the shutting down of nuclear and coal plants. Europe's dependence means it's feeding the bear that threatens it.

In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia. Shortly after, President Obama announced a ""reset"" policy with Russia. This was consistent with President Bush, who found Putin ""straightforward and trustworthy."" In 2014, Putin punished Ukraine for ousting its pro-Russian puppet president by annexing Crimea. The West responded with tepid sanctions. President Trump equated Putin's killings of journalists and dissidents with the actions of the United States not once, but twice. ""There are a lot of killers,"" Trump told Bill O'Reilly in a 2017 interview. ""You think our country's so innocent?"" In 2015, he said, ""I think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe, so you know."" He continued to describe Putin as a leader and someone whom he respects.

No, the United States isn't perfect. But the lack of moral clarity when equating a country that has representational government, freedom of speech, real elections, a mostly free economy, and a separation of church and state with the monstrosity of a dictator like Putin emboldens the Kremlin and does real damage. Putting Putin on an equal footing affects the way we think of our relations with him.

If someone were your moral equal, why would you hesitate to become largely dependent on him for natural gas? To Trump's credit, he did in fact warn Europe that this was not a good idea. But the point is that the lack of moral clarity dilutes our thinking. It would be like going into business with a known con man — you are only fooling yourself. It also gives the Kremlin the green light to accelerate thuggish tactics because it sends the message that we do not care. Trump's quote is indicative of the waffling Western leaders have shown toward Putin.

So what's wrong with the precedents set by all these administrations? The common denominator is that they negate the nature of Russia. The West views these events — the invasion of Georgia here, attacking American troops there — as episodic. Westerners haven't connected the dots.

In relation to other nations, the first question one should ask is, what type of country is this? Is it mostly free or controlled? Does it respect individual rights? How can its past inform us? What are its ambitions? Any honest assessment of Russia would have concluded that it was not a country to be trusted, much less become dependent upon for natural gas, as Europe has. Instead, we project our sense of life onto Russia and assume that the Russians think like us. Consider the context of Obama's ""reset"" policy. Stable, good-willed countries don't invade other countries for no reason. This should have been a huge clue for Obama that Putin and the Russian government are not like other foreign nations. Treating them as if they only sanctioned their behavior.

I am not saying we should have gone to war with Russia. I am saying there is plenty the West could have done to deter Russian aggression outside military action: sanctions with teeth, diversifying energy, and morally condemning the hell out of their aggression, for starters.

This last point is important. The power of the bully pulpit cannot be overstated. One of the best traits Ronald Reagan had was that he called a spade a spade. The ""evil empire"" is what he called the Soviet Union. After the Berlin wall fell, freedom fighters in the eastern bloc said his rhetoric had given them courage and hope. There is something motivating to knowing that the United States is on your side.

Today's leaders have lost that power of rhetoric. There is no animating love of freedom running through their veins. There are no spokesmen for the American story. The Russians and the Chinese fear it. They fear it because of the ideas it represents. At some level, they know freedom beats authoritarianism every time. They don't want that to be broadcast to the world. That's the kind of spirit that needs to be revived in America and in the West if we want to avoid the mistakes of the past.

https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2022/01/10/boulder-colorado-planning-local-gun-ban-waiting-periods-n54210,"Boulder, Colorado planning local gun ban, waiting periods","Colorado Democrats ditched the state’s firearm preemption law last year, allowing localities to impose their own gun control restrictions that go beyond the laws approved by the state legislature. While most municipalities didn’t immediately turn around and start passing new restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms, a number of cities have apparently been quietly working behind the scenes to craft local ordinances that are designed to impose new criminal sanctions on those exercising their Second Amendment rights.

Advertisement

Leading the way is Boulder, Colorado, which appears poised to reinstate a ban on so-called assault weapons that was previously struck down for violating the state’s now-voided preemption law.

The ban, originally instituted in 2018 in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was deemed invalid by Boulder District Court last year, 10 days before a gunman killed 10 people at the King Soopers on Table Mesa Drive. Judge Andrew Hartman ruled March 12 that only state or federal laws can prohibit the possession, sale and transfer of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. Colorado had passed laws “that are effectively a scheme preempting local governments from enacting municipal firearms and magazine possession ordinances,” according to court documents. However, following the King Soopers shooting, that changed. “Partly in response to that tragedy, the state Legislature repealed the preemption statute,” City Attorney Teresa Tate said. The original ban, which officials previously admitted would be hard to enforce, bans certain pistols and semiautomatic rifles with pistol grips, a folding or telescoping stock or any protruding grip that allows a weapon to be stabilized with the nontrigger hand. In addition to the assault weapons ban, the City Council on Tuesday directed city staff to work on additional regulations regarding firearms. Examples provided by Tate included strengthening regulations regarding open carrying, prohibiting the carry of firearms in sensitive areas and a waiting period for the purchase of firearms.

It’s not just Boulder. Other suburbs are also planning their own local ordinances, and the Daily Camera newspaper reports that some activists are suggesting a coordinated unveiling of the proposals on March 22nd, the one-year anniversary of the shootings at the Boulder grocery store.

Now, if these were serious proposals that actually had a chance of reducing violent crime or stopping active shooters, Boulder and the other Denver suburbs would be rushing to put these new ordinances in place. Instead, these city council members are happy to delay the official introduction (not to mention any attempt at enforcement) until a more symbolically significant time.

Unfortunately, while the implementation of these new proposals may be centered around symbolism, the ordinances themselves are likely to have very real consequences for gun owners in Colorado, who will soon have to deal with a patchwork quilt of local gun laws that can vary depending on what side of the street you might be driving. These local misdemeanors aren’t going to actually stop anyone with evil intentions, but they’re going to play hell with legal gun owners and firearm retailers.

Take the proposed waiting period for gun purchases that Boulder’s city attorney mentioned. The vast majority of criminals aren’t obtaining their firearms through commercial sales in the first place, so this is one of those ordinances that seems designed to be more of a burden on the law-abiding than anything else. It also has the potential to put Boulder gun stores out of business by imposing additional restrictions on the lawful purchase of a firearm; restrictions that might not exist if you don’t mind driving an extra 10 or 20 miles. How many gun owners in Boulder are going to continue shopping at their local gun shop if they can avoid dealing with the city’s nonsensical policy prescriptions just by getting in their car and heading to another suburb or the nearest rural county?

Of course for the city council in Boulder, that would be a bonus, not a bug in their legislation. They’d love to run gun stores out of town, closely followed by gun owners themselves.

Stay tuned, because just as Boulder’s last gun ban was struck down by the courts, I suspect that any new local ordinances imposed by that city or other Denver suburbs are going to be legally challenged as well; not as a violation of the state’s preemption law, but as a violation of the Second Amendment rights of Colorado residents.",Q1

Thomas claimed ""ballot fraud co-conspirators"" were on barges at Guantánamo Bay to be tried for sedition.

Thomas shared several QAnon-related conspiracy theories in texts obtained by the Washington Post.

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' wife floated an outlandish conspiracy that members of the ""Biden crime family"" and ""ballot fraud co-conspirators"" were being sent to barges off of Guantánamo Bay to face military trials for sedition in newly-uncovered text messages with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, texted Meadows in the days after the 2020 election, according to the messages obtained by the House Committee investigating January 6 and reported on by the Washington Post's Bob Woodward and CBS News' Robert Costa.

""Biden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators (elected officials, bureaucrats, social media censorship mongers, fake stream media reporters, etc) are being arrested & detained for ballot fraud right now & over coming days, & will be living in barges off GITMO to face military tribunals for sedition,"" Thomas wrote in a message on November 5, 2020, two days after the presidential election, according to the Post.

Adherents of the Q-Anon conspiracy movement spread those and similar conspiracy theories throughout late 2020 and early 2021, falsely claiming online that officials including Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff had been rounded up in mass arrests, sent to Guantánamo, and executed for treason.

No Biden allies, elected officials, bureaucrats, or journalists were ever sent to Guantánamo or put on trial for sedition in connection to the 2020 election.

Thomas espoused QAnon-adjacent theories in many of the nearly 30 texts reported on by the Post.

The first message Thomas sent Meadows referenced a since-removed YouTube video from Steve Pieczenik, a conspiracy theorist who has previously espoused the baseless theory that the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a ""false flag"" operation meant to gin up support for gun restrictions.

In another message reported by the Post, Thomas referenced a popular QAnon theory that Trump had deliberately ""watermarked"" mail ballots to find potential voter fraud.

""Watermarked ballots in over 12 states have been part of a huge Trump & military white hat sting operation in 12 key battleground states,"" she said.

The partisan review of the 2020 election results in Maricopa County, Arizona commissioned by the state Senate and conducted by the now-defunct firm Cyber Ninjas searched for such marks, but failed to uncover any evidence of ballots being watermarked.

In other texts, Thomas urged Meadows not to concede the election, privately trashed Republicans in Congress, rallied behind controversial lawyer Sidney Powell, and told Meadows to ""Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down.""

A New York Times story in February reported that Thomas had been involved in the planning of the rallies on January 6, including playing a ""uniting"" role between different rally organizers.

Thomas downplayed her connection to January 6 rally organizers in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon and said she left the Save America rally before Trump's speech because of the cold weather. But the texts show her deep interest in trying to overturn the 2020 election — in addition to her fervent belief in conspiracy theories that originated with the QAnon movement.",Q1
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/biden-throws-putin-a-nuclear-lifeline,Biden throws Putin a nuclear lifeline,"The Russian war of aggression in Ukraine has significantly encumbered the Biden administration’s drive to reach a renewed Iran nuclear deal. Seeing an opportunity to build leverage against the United States and Europe as they impose sanctions on Russia, Vladimir Putin threw a grenade into the Iran talks taking place in Vienna. The Russian strongman demanded a “white channel” with Tehran to circumvent international sanctions. This was apparently a bridge too far for U.S. diplomats, who had until that point seemed willing to cave on any and every Iranian demand to seal a deal.

The negotiators left Vienna to reassess their options, but that didn’t stop Russia and Iran from sending their counterparts clear messages. Since then, Russia has unleashed unspeakable violence on Ukraine, while the Iranian regime fired missiles near the American Consulate in northern Iraq. If the latest reports are true, the U.S. has just agreed to allow Russia to carry out nuclear work mandated under the 2015 nuclear deal: uranium swaps with Iran, work on the Fordow nuclear facility, and the provision of nuclear fuel to Iranian reactors.

The Biden White House is apparently indifferent to the terrible optics. While war rages on the edge of Europe and the U.S.-led world order hangs in the balance, a deal is now in the works that is set to empower Putin’s Russia and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s Islamic Republic.

If it wasn’t clear before, it should be now: This is no time for a deal with either of those authoritarian regimes.

Already under fire at home for its disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, the Biden administration is undeniably struggling to find its equilibrium after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is uncertain about imposing the most effective sanctions, such as cutting off all Russian banks from global commerce and tying up Russian energy revenues. And it is unwilling to deploy force. The White House thus appears content to rally the international community to express its collective outrage. But that will do little to stop Putin’s destruction of Ukraine, let alone mitigate Americans’ sticker shock at gas stations and supermarkets as oil and food prices soar. It also will not help preserve the American-led world order, which is increasingly under assault by Russia, Iran, and China.

There may have been a moment when the Biden White House believed a deal with Tehran might demonstrate American leadership amid the crisis in Ukraine. But that moment has passed, as Putin seems to have settled into the driver’s seat there as well. The Russian negotiator in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, has emerged as the dominant advocate for Iran’s case. Ulyanov recently boasted, “Iran got much more than it could expect in [the] Vienna talks.” This is now undeniably the truth. But Russia’s perks are not inconsiderable, either.

The American concession that enables Russia to conduct nuclear work with the Islamic Republic, even as Putin threatens to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, is foreign policy malpractice. It’s hard to argue otherwise. Still, some might say that at least the White House held firm and denied the Russian request for a sanctions “white channel” to trade with Iran. Yes, that was technically taken off the table. However, Russia will effectively get a white channel anyway because the Biden administration would never sanction Iranian entities transacting with Russian businesses once a deal is signed. Indeed, the administration has already surrendered to Iranian nuclear blackmail. Besides, it’s also possible that the U.S. will provide secret guarantees to Iran or even Russia in side letters. Washington struck secret side deals in the last agreement that were never made public. Nothing prevents the White House from doing so again.

Not to be left out, China reportedly is also asking for a special carve-out for Chinese entities previously sanctioned. Russia recently approached Beijing to help finance the war effort in Ukraine. Should Joe Biden agree to any of this, it would be a political collapse of epic proportions.

What makes this all so baffling is the fact that the Iran deal of 2015 was no great achievement in the first place. Tehran did not need to cheat to reach threshold nuclear-weapons capabilities. With key constraints set to sunset, the regime was prepared to wait for a decade while the terms of the deal yielded the regime an industrial-size enrichment program, a near-zero breakout time, an advanced centrifuge-powered clandestine path to a nuclear warhead, long-range ballistic missiles that could threaten America, and access to advanced conventional weaponry to target America’s allies across the Middle East. The estimated $150 billion in sanctions relief granted to Iran enabled it to fund its terrorist proxies to expand the regime’s regional dominance. Worse, those funds increasingly immunized the regime against future Western sanctions.

Former President Donald Trump exited the original deal in 2018. Biden’s team has vowed to restore it. But the “new” deal promises to be far worse than the original. Biden’s chief negotiator in Vienna, Rob Malley, reportedly aims to remove the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from the State Department’s list of terror groups; the Guard has been responsible for terrorist attacks worldwide. He was reportedly ready to cave on U.S. sanctions against the regime’s top human rights abusers, including the current president, Ebrahim Raisi, who is responsible for murdering thousands of Iranian dissidents in the 1980s. Biden was also prepared to lift sanctions on the office of Khamenei, a human rights abuser himself, along with his multibillion-dollar slush fund.

As our colleague Saeed Ghasseminejad calculated, under the new deal, the Islamic Republic could immediately gain access to a total sanctions relief package of up to $130 billion. And that doesn’t include tens of billions in additional perks as the regime plugs back into international banks and businesses. This is not only an outrage to our regional allies, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Israel, which are under constant threat of Iranian missiles and terrorism. It’s also an outrage to American gold star families of soldiers killed by Iran-backed terrorists. More than 1,000 of them have signed a letter urging Biden not to give the clerical regime this money, particularly when they are owed billions in damages for Iranian terrorist attacks in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and elsewhere. Biden has not answered their letter.

Team Biden has similarly shrugged off the controversy surrounding reports that the negotiators agreed to close one file currently open with the International Atomic Energy Agency involving the regime’s production of enriched uranium metal that is key to building the core of a nuclear bomb. On three other files related to undeclared nuclear materials and activities, Biden’s team agreed to let the IAEA keep trying to get answers until June. After that, based on past patterns, the Biden team will likely ignore Iran’s nuclear intransigence and block punitive action by the IAEA Board of Governors.

But perhaps the worst collapse by the Biden team in Vienna was the inclusion of an “inherent guarantee” to the regime. Reports out of Tehran and other Middle Eastern capitals suggest that the Biden team offered a written guarantee stipulating that if the Iranians say there is a breach of the agreement, including if a future administration exits the deal (as Trump did in 2018), the regime in Iran will have the right to enrich uranium at 60% and to install thousands of advanced centrifuges. In other words, the Biden administration has reportedly decided to legitimize Iranian nuclear blackmail. This guarantee will, in all likelihood, be part of a series of side letters. Just as it happened in 2015, the world will never see the text of these promises. Indeed, the American public may never know the extent of Biden’s concessions.

For the Biden White House, the point of these extreme concessions has always been to put the Iranian nuclear problem “in a box” so that Washington could pivot to contain the rise of the revisionist powers: Russia and China. But the agreement will feed the Iranian war machine in the Middle East. It’s also a jack-in-the-box; the Iranian nuclear program springs out once restrictions sunset. As Putin has just made crystal clear: An unhinged regional aggressor backed with nuclear weapons is a nightmare to contain. The clerical regime in Iran almost certainly seeks to follow his lead.

This may, in fact, be the plan. The terms of the new Iran agreement were brokered by Russia. Putin only agreed to it because it would help to undermine the U.S.-led world order. Tehran would never assent to a deal without Putin’s consent because the regime knows it will need Russia in the future.

The world has changed since Feb. 24, when Vladimir Putin ordered his army to invade Ukraine. Whatever the Biden White House thought it would achieve in Vienna, it must think again. This is the time for deterring, not empowering, rogue regimes.

Prosecutors in Michigan typically have to present some evidence to show there’s probable cause to send people to trial on felony charges, a low bar. Ethan Crumbley waived his right to go through that stage.

Crumbley, 15, is charged as an adult with murder and other crimes. Four students were killed and others were injured during a Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School, about 30 miles north of Detroit.

Crumbley’s court hearing lasted less than 10 minutes. Separately, his parents are due in court Friday afternoon to try to get their bond lowered to $100,000 from $500,000 and leave jail.

Jennifer and James Crumbley are charged with involuntary manslaughter. They’re accused of making a gun accessible to their son and refusing to take him home earlier that day when school counselors confronted them with distressing drawings of violence.

“The last thing they expected was that a school shooting would take place, or that their son would be responsible,” defense attorneys Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman said in a court filing.

Prosecutors are opposing the lower bond. They noted that the couple went missing for hours when charges were announced Dec. 3, before police found them miles away in a Detroit art studio early the next morning.

Smith said they had planned to appear in court Dec. 4.

The Crumbleys “will flee if they get the opportunity,” prosecutors said in a court filing, noting that they were behind on mortgage payments and had put their house up for sale.

Oxford High students are expected to return to school next week for the first time since the shooting but at a different building. The high school could reopen during the week of Jan. 23.",Q1

This convoy, unlike Canada’s so-called “Freedom Convoy,” claims it will be able to protect funds raised to help those participating by placing donations into an escrow account.

Canada’s truckers were of course undermined in their efforts after issues with the crowdfunding platforms GoFundMe and GiveSendGo.

The former dropped a campaign for the convoy, while the latter was hacked — leading to the names of those who donated becoming public.

On Newmax TV’s The Balance, Bolling shared an exclusive announcement that the U.S. convoy has not only organized, but that it will be cash-independent.

Bolling was joined by guests Dr. Ryan Cole, pilot Josh Yoder, and organizers of the convoy Brian Brase and Maureen Steele.

Cole represents a group of physicians who oppose mandates, while Yoder represents airplane pilots who intend to participate in what is being called the “People’s Convoy.”

Brase told Bolling he expects the moving protest to swell in size as it traverses the country toward Washington.

“I think you’re going to see it grow as we move across the country,” Brase said. “Initially, we’ve projected potentially a little over a thousand trucks right out the gate to start.”

Steele then explained how the People’s Convoy intends to evade relying on Big Tech for financing:

We have been able to really garner some of the best and brightest on our team to make sure that this convoy goes off without a hitch. We have a logistics specialist, tacticians, we’re ensuring we have fuel. We’ve brought on Exemplar Financial, which has seven offices throughout the country with lawyers and accountants that are overseeing our fundraising to make sure that’s buttoned up.

Because of how they’ve set up their fundraising, Steele concluded, “Our funds are not going to be able to be frozen or hijacked.”

The People’s Convoy will purportedly leave California for the country’s capital before the end of February.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1676912/ppp-workers-seek-long-march-stopover-in-gujrat,PPP workers seek long march stopover in Gujrat,"GUJRAT: The local cadres of the Pakistan People’s Party have asked senior party leaders to include a stopover of party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari-led long march in Gujrat city.

The march on Islamabad is due to start from Karachi on Feb 27.

A meeting of local party workers was held at the Pagganwala House to review the arrangements for mobilising the masses.

An important political development in the local politics of Gujrat was also observed in the meeting due to the presence of Chaudhry Faisal Mukhtar, the scion of former federal minister (late) Chaudhary Ahmed Mukhtar, as none of the family members of Mr Mukhtar’s family had earlier been active in the Gujrat politics since 2013.

However, the PPP chairman has nominated Faisal Mukhtar as a member of party’s logistics committee that is tasked with finalising route, stopovers and other relevant arrangements for the long march as Sharjeel Memon heads that committee.

Former PPP MNA Sameena Pagganwala, Mian Fakhar Mushtaq Pagganwala, city president Mir Anjum, district general secretary Dr Zahid Zaheer and other party workers stressed the need to include GTS Chowk stopover in the route plan and the party chairman should also deliver a speech.

Sources said that earlier it had been proposed that march should pass through Gujrat bypass with stopover in Lalamusa, the home town of party stalwart Qamar Zaman Kaira.

The PPP cadre from Gujrat and Jalalpur Jattan towns also lodged strong protest against the policy of ignoring Gujrat city that, according to them, had always been an important political station in central Punjab.

Faisal Mukhtar assured the workers that Gujrat city would have a stopover. The PPP workers asked Faisal to become active in Gujrat politics and assured him of their complete cooperation.

A participant of the meeting told Dawn that Faisal Mukhtar would himself lead the reception of long march in Gujrat city. He promised regular visits to the city in future to keep in touch with supporters of his late father.

Murdered: A man and a 20-year-old girl were found murdered at Harrar village of Karianwala police precincts on Thursday.

Police said the initial investigation suggested that a man had first shot the girl dead and later shot himself with the same pistol that was found lying near his body at the scene. The motive behind the incident is yet to be ascertained.

Reports said student Neelum was on her way back home after attending the college and tuition centre in a nearby town, when Ali Raza (25) of the same village intercepted her and opened fire, killing her on the spot.

Later on, Raza, a security guard at a petrol pump, committed suicide by shooting himself dead with the same pistol.

Police reached the spot and found the pistol lying beside his body.

The bodies were shifted to Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital (ABSTH) for autopsy whereas a team of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) collected the evidence from the crime scene.

Gujrat DPO Umar Salamat said police had launched the investigation.

Per Reuters , India acknowledges the missile originated within its borders, but a statement from the nation's Ministry of Defense claims the projectile out of the northern city of Sirsa, which landed in Pakistan's Punjab province, was shot off in error. ""In the course of a routine maintenance, a technical malfunction led to the accidental firing of a missile,"" the ministry says in a statement. ""While the incident is deeply regrettable, it is also a matter of relief that there has been no loss of life due to the accident.""

The ministry adds that a ""high-level"" government inquiry has been ordered. A member of the Pakistani air force says the missile flew at 44,000 feet for a distance of nearly 80 miles within Pakistan's airspace, before landing in the eastern Pakistani city of Mian Channu. The military there says there was some damage to the wall of a residential structure, but no fatalities, per the AP. Pakistan, naturally, is somewhat cranky over the incident. ""The flight path of this object endangered many national and international passenger flights both in Indian and Pakistani airspace, as well as human life and property on ground,"" a military spokesman says, per Reuters.

Maj. Gen. Babar Iftikhar of Pakistan, who says there were no sensitive military installations where the missile came down, is demanding an explanation, calling what happened a ""flagrant violation,"" reports the AP, which notes that India and Pakistan have had three wars with each other—two over the disputed region of Kashmir—since they separated and gained independence from Britain in 1947. Both countries have nuclear weapons, which is concerning, but some are praising them for how they handled this week's apparent mishap.

In a paper published in the Journal of Natural Products, van Breeman and colleagues showed these cannabinoid acids can prevent the very first phase of infection called the cell entry step.

“We proved the principle and established that small molecules can bind to the spike protein and if they bind in the right place, they can prevent the virus from infecting human cells in a manner similar to the way antibodies do,” said van Breeman.

After people get vaccinated, antibodies bind to the surface of a virus and prevent it from infecting human cells. In the case of the novel coronavirus, antibodies recognize the spike protein— the surface protein that gives the coronavirus type-2 its crown-like appearance. Those spikes are how the virus interacts with human cells and enables it to invade and infect.

In a lab at Oregon Health and Science University, van Breeman’s hemp compound hypothesis was tested in live coronavirus cultures. Researchers were able to show that cannabinoid acids— much smaller than human antibodies— effectively bound to very specific regions of the coronavirus spike protein and essentially disabled the virus.

Is a plant-based oral supplement to prevent coronavirus infection on the horizon? The next step is the clinical trials to prove efficacy.

“The good news about the discovery of these hemp compounds is that they’ve been used by people for thousands of years,” said van Breeman. “And in recent times we’ve studied their safety. We know these compounds can be absorbed to reach the bloodstream, if taken orally.”

There has been a vast amount of research already conducted on Cannabis sativa's use and that could possibly shave years off the time needed for van Breeman's clinical trials.

“These cannabinoid acids are abundant in hemp and in many hemp extracts,” van Breemen said. “They are not controlled substances like THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana,” van Breeman makes clear.

The hemp plant produces a large number of cannabinoids. Some cannabis varieties have been developed that produce more THC for marijuana purposes or fiber for rope producing purposes. But all varieties produce cannabinoids. One of the early bio-chemically synthesized forms of cannabinoids are the acids and these are the stars in van Breeman’s research.

Richard van Breeman said his team’s additional research showed the hemp compounds were equally effective against variants of SARS-CoV-2, including variant B.1.1.7, which was first detected in the United Kingdom, and variant B.1.351, first detected in South Africa. They have yet to test against the delta and Omicron variants but plan to do so. Even as Richard van Breeman and his team find collaborators to begin clinical trials of efficacy in people.

Richard van Breeman is a researcher with Oregon State’s Global Hemp Innovation Center, College of Pharmacy and Linus Pauling Institute.

Van Breemen, Ruth Muchiro of the College of Pharmacy and Linus Pauling Institute and five scientists from OHSU (Timothy Bates, Jules Weinstein, Hans Leier, Scotland Farley and Fikadu Tafesse) also contributed to the cannabinoid study which identified the two cannabinoid acids via a mass spectrometry-based screening technique invented in van Breemen’s laboratory.

Van Breemen’s team screened a range of botanicals used as dietary supplements including red clover, wild yam, hops and three species of licorice.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/story/2022-01-18/gun-tijuana-photojournalist,Gun used to kill Tijuana photojournalist linked to five other violent crimes,"TIJUANA — Veteran journalist Margarito Martínez Esquivel climbed into his truck Monday, just after lunch, heading out to cover yet another violent crime in one of the most dangerous cities in the world.

Moments later, he was shot dead in his driveway.

Hiram Sánchez Zamora, chief prosecutor for central Baja California, said Tuesday a 9mm handgun used to kill Martínez had been used in five other violent crimes in the Sanchez Taboada area of Tijuana since 2020.

That and the location of the victim’s gunshot wounds — one in the head and two in the chest — might point to a professional assassin. Law enforcement officials were also investigating reports of a possible dispute with one of his many neighbors, the prosecutor said.

Sánchez revealed some details of the investigation at a news conference Tuesday morning, saying state investigators were exploring all possible explanations for the shooting.

“We have not ruled out any line of investigation,” said Sánchez.

Meanwhile, dozens of soldiers with the National Guard and the Mexican Army guarded state investigators as they searched nearby homes in the Camino Verde neighborhood where Martínez lived.

Sánchez said investigators had not yet recovered or searched Martínez’s cell phone, but he wasn’t certain whether a family member had the phone. Three shell casings were recovered by forensic investigators at the crime scene on Monday afternoon.

The Tijuana-based press guild Yo Sí Soy Periodista (which translates in English as Yes, I AM a journalist) had expressed concern for Martínez’s safety just a month prior to the shooting when a man threatened the 49-year-old photographer online. That man accused Martínez of running Facebook pages that exposed criminals with ties to organized crime.

Martínez was in the process of seeking government protection through the Federal Protection Mechanism for Human Rights Defenders and Journalists, an agency formed in 2012 to address Mexico’s rising violence against activists and reporters.

The National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) of Mexico on Tuesday condemned the fatal attack.

“The CNDH repudiates the murder of photojournalist Alfonso Margarito Martínez Esquivel and calls on the competent authorities so that, within the framework of their powers, they carry out the pertinent investigations until they find the persons responsible,” the agency said in a written statement.

Baja California’s Human Rights Commission released a statement saying “any attack on journalists constitutes an attack on freedom of expression and the right of a society to be informed.”

Martínez, who had more than 20 years of experience working as a professional journalist covering crime, had collaborated with Baja California news agencies such as Semanario Zeta, Cadena Noticias, La Jornada Baja California and Punto Norte. He also worked with international media outlets, including the BBC, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post and The San Diego Union Tribune.",Q1

It would be funny if this kind of unserious idiocy was not going to get scores of our troops killed. In fact, scores of our troops have already gotten killed through gross incompetence, 13 of them in Afghanistan during Operation Utter Failure. And more will die. War is serious business and in America, it is being overseen by fatally unserious people obsessed with liberal wine women fetishes like “diversity, inclusion and equity” (DIE) instead of combat readiness. They will put the “die” in “DIE.”

I wish I had some good news for you, but there isn’t any. We have three more years of this diapered dementite as our alleged commander-in-chief and he’s too stupid and too stubborn to change. It’s bad enough when a smart, savvy man becomes senile, but Joe Biden started off as a moron, so he’s already got a huge head start as he degenerates into drooling incontinence. And our enemies know it. Let’s review a short and incomplete list of places our Pentagon, under his leadership, will lose wars during the next three years thanks to him and his incompetent flunkies.

There’s Ukraine, where we have zero good military options but Grandpa Badfinger and his coterie of quarter-wits think we should front as if we do. Do you imagine Putin, the ex-KGB colonel, has any illusions about what we can do there? He has something like 80 battalions supported by the full spectrum of battlefield operating systems in position around Ukraine like a noose around its neck. We have a couple of random battalions without all the good stuff that actually kills the enemy (like masses of artillery) parked in nearby countries as a “show of force.” It’s a show of farce. Ukraine persists because Putin deigns to allow it. What’s holding him back is not that America might cause him to lose but that our fecklessness would let him win. And then, like the terrier that catches the Camry, he would have to deal with what he caught. That’s the threat, not a few unsupported battalions of 82nd Airborne guys in Poland. Only a lunatic wants to buy an endless guerrilla war with vodka-fueled Ukrainians who will take their AKs home and start making life miserable for the invaders. I’ve worked with those guys – they may lack finesse but, unlike us, they are serious, particularly when they get their drink on.

Then there’s China. Who thinks Xi is going to wait to assimilate Taiwan until Biden departs? It’s not like Xi is going to face a less competent opponent next unless Kamala gets elected in 2024, and the chances of that are, charitably, low. This is his time. He knows it. The smart people here and in Taiwan know it. Does our failed national security state know it? Probably – anyone can see it – but our Pentagon is busy fighting the real enemy. You know, the weather and insurrectionist Americans who refuse to concede that some men can menstruate.

North Korea is firing missiles again. Iran is about to break out and light its own hot rock. Word is that there was a recent classified briefing for senators on Iranian capabilities and the solons staggered out of it pale and scared. But don’t worry, we can unleash a withering barrage of pronouns that will put those Shia fanatics in their place. And we totally outgun them all in “diversity, inclusion, and equity,” so we’ve got that going for us, which is nice.

Yeah, in a time of serious challenges, our punchline Pentagon is engaging in unserious posturing designed not to defeat America’s enemies but to garner more stars on the epaulets of a bunch of general officers who have not won a real war in 31 years.

I remember that. I was there in the desert, far in the rear at a corps headquarters, when America’s DIE-deficient military mauled an entire national army in 100 hours of ground combat. Our enemies feared us in the wake of our merciless triumph. But what are our foes to make of this word salad of faculty lounge clichés that we’re spewing today? They will assess, correctly, that we are not a serious military. Sure, we have some residual capabilities, but they are fading as time rolls on and Navy ships run into each other or catch fire in port. We are Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. Every day, we sit in Saigon getting wreaker and Charlie squats out there in the bush getting stronger.

“Diversity, equity, and inclusion” - what does this nonsense even mean? How about “lethality?” There’s a concept. Our struggles are supposed to be on the battlefield, not in struggle sessions in garrison. Once our military forcibly suppressed the worst aspects of civilian society to create a united force – “You recruits are all equally worthless!” But under the DIE paradigm, alleged differences are curated in order to create – what? A 'woke' Army where everyone checks his privilege and celebrates his grievances but can’t win a damn war? We’ve got plenty of grievances but a paucity of victories.

Understand that this essential unseriousness about our military is why you see all the focus on “special ops.” There’s got to be some aspect of the military that is still sort of serious, though the woke pathogen is invading the SOCOM community too. We pretend that America is strong because a glorified platoon of highly-trained highly-resourced guys – and it is all guys – goes in and smokes some terrorists. But news flash – the military is not the Rangers or Green Berets or SEALs. It’s regular companies of infantry. It’s swabbies making big ships go and zoomies making airplanes fly. And it's in the regular units that we’re failing.

Here’s the reality – soldiers do what the commander checks. If the commander checks combat readiness, then combat readiness is what he gets. But if he checks wokeness, if he prioritizes the CRT dogma that has wrecked academia and corporate America, then he gets a woke military that can’t win a war.

And we can’t win a war. Not against Russia, not against China, and not against the other petty dictators emboldened by our manifest weakness. Congratulations, all you folks who chose this human asterisk because Donald Trump was mean to Rosie O‘Donnell and that was unbearable. You got what you chose – a senile joke who is accelerating the already in-progress decline of what just a few decades ago was arguably the greatest military in human history.

https://euroradio.fm/en/how-much-will-belaruskali-lose-after-yara-withdraws,How much will Belaruskali lose after Yara withdraws?,"Yara is much bigger than the Norwegian market. According to Alyaksandr Yarashuk, chairman of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions, Belarus sold more than 11 million tons of potash last year. Yara bought about 1.3 million tons out of this amount, which is 11-12%. Then the Belarusian potash was sent to various countries of the world.

Since the data on how much Belarus earned from the sale of potash fertilizers in 2021 is closed, and the terms of the contracts are unknown, the calculations of the affected revenue from Yara's withdrawal can only be calculated approximately. If we consider the data of 2020, the 11-12% purchased by Yara is from $265 million to $289 million for the year.

According to experts, this is a significant amount for Belaruskali, but not critical. Belaruskali may be able to redirect exports to other countries.

""It will be painful, but not fatal. One should look at the Asian markets. It is very likely that there will be a way out of this situation. We will have to keep track of the contracts that have been signed since March because it's the dead season. There are standard contracts signed in February. March and April will show where and with whom Belaruskali will be backing itself up,"" said political analyst Ihar Tyshkevich.

""Yara operates around the world. It is a serious partner for Belaruskali. But, by my assessment, Yara's withdrawal from Belarus will not cause a collapse at Belaruskali,"" says Yarashuk.

Russia will help, while Yara may trade through its subsidiaries.

According to Ihar Tyshkevich, Belarus can send the extra volumes of raw materials not only to the biggest buyers like Brazil, India or China. There is also an option to sell the potassium to the Russian competitor, Uralchem. The fertilizer may even be supplied to Yara as if it were Russian.",Q1

However, an intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, said that the Intelligence Committee did already know about the agency’s classified collection of the data itself.

https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/03/08/lets-not-forget/,Let’s Not Forget,"My friend in Canada sent me a message yesterday, she wrote:

“This war in Ukraine must bring lots of painful memories of your own country.” I couldn’t respond to her message as I didn’t know which memory hurt me the most.

Since the Russian Ukraine war started, I’ve been thinking about wars that were launched on Iraq and other counties in the Middle East. During the first Gulf war in the early nineties I was a new immigrant to Canada. I watched my beloved country burning hence Wolf Blitzer the reporter from CNN described the sky of Baghdad as a Xmas tree. For more than a month I didn’t know who survived the continuous bombing on Baghdad where my family resided.

I thought of the sanction that was imposed on Iraq for thirteen years and the other wars the Americans launched along with their allies on Iraq.

The Iraqis lived since the early nineties in fear, the lack of basic living necessities was their norm. The image of the American soldiers putting their boats on the head of the innocent iraqi civilians, the faces of the terrified women and children while the soldiers were fetching their homes stayed in my memory all that time. Let’s not forget about Abou Ghraib prison and the ugly images of the torture and humiliation of the Iraqi prisoners shared by the media.

Abeer al Janabi the 14 year old Iraqi kid who was raped in front of her family members before murdering the whole family was another story of the American’s atrocities.

During the three decades I was a tax payer in Canada but was called a filthy immigrant, a terrorist and was asked to go back to my country. But at the same time I witnessed and involved in most of the rallies and walked side by side with the Canadians who called for justice and peace in the Middle East.

The media played and still playing an unfair role covering the news in the Middle East. The stories of the people who live in Iraq, Ghaza, Yemen and Syrian are/ were not covered with honesty and fairness.

I am an Iraqi Canadian women who feels for whoever will be killed in any war. At the end we are all equal we are not different from the European or the people who live in North America. Iraq was the cradle of civilization, Damascus was the oldest capital in the world and Yemen was called he land of milk and honey and the people in Gaza are fighting oppression and occupation.

We are not a third world nation, there is no difference between our colour or theirs. We have our prosperous people who lost their homes, dreams and hopes because of the wars and immigrated to Europe and North America but became successful citizens. So don’t label us you’re not better than us, we are all equal.

https://kion546.com/news/2022/03/10/florida-senate-passes-ban-on-schools-and-businesses-teaching-people-to-feel-guilty-for-racist-history/,Florida Senate passes GOP-backed ban on teaching students to ‘feel guilt’ for history,"By Steve Contorno, CNN

The Florida Senate voted Thursday to ban public schools and private businesses from teaching people to feel guilty for historical events committed by people of their race, addressing a top priority of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The bill, which passed the GOP-controlled state Senate by a vote of 24-15, would also prohibit instruction that says certain races or sexes are privileged or oppressed. The legislation previously passed the state House 74-41 and now heads to DeSantis’ desk, where he is expected to sign it.

The crackdown on certain teachings about race in Florida is part of a national effort by Republicans to remove critical race theory from school curricula, even where it doesn’t exist. The movement has mobilized conservative parents and voters and has turned schools into the front lines of a national cultural war leading up to the 2022 midterms.

DeSantis, who faces reelection this year and is a potential future presidential candidate, has led that charge. Last year, his administration banned critical race theory from K-12 schools. And in December, he called on lawmakers to extend the prohibition to all public schools, including colleges, and the workplace, in a proposal he named the Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees (W.O.K.E.) Act.

“We must protect Florida workers against the hostile work environment that is created when large corporations force their employees to endure CRT-inspired ‘training’ and indoctrination,” DeSantis said at the time.

The legislation does not specifically mention critical race theory, which acknowledges that racism is both systemic and institutional in American society and has benefited White people and oppressed Black and brown Americans. A bill analysis by state Senate staff, however, highlights the teaching of critical race theory as something that would be prohibited under the legislation.

“No one is teaching critical race theory,” state Sen. Audrey Gibson, a Black Democrat from Jacksonville, said during Thursday’s debate. “This is a bill in search of a problem that we don’t have.”

“This is politically driven,” she added. “This is designed to create division.”

On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers spent hours questioning the bill’s Republican sponsor, state Sen. Manny Díaz Jr., over what instruction would be allowed. They repeatedly asked Díaz for real world examples in Florida of where teachers or employers were indoctrinating people; he had little to provide.

The bill previously said instruction cannot make people feel “discomfort” for their race or sex, which drew widespread concern that it could lead to schools desensitizing historical events such as Jim Crow, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II or the Stonewall riots. However, that language was changed to now prohibit instruction that someone “must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress” for their race or sex.

The legislation headed to DeSantis attempts to make clear that schools can teach about slavery and the history of racial segregation and discrimination in an “age-appropriate manner” but the instruction cannot “indoctrinate or persuade students to a particular point of view.”

“If you tell a student in the classroom that because he’s a male, he is responsible for any sexist laws or actions that have been taken in the past, that is a violation of this bill,” Díaz said Wednesday when questioned about the bill. “If you tell a White student that they are responsible for slavery, that’s a violation of this bill. It doesn’t preclude you from covering the topic, giving your perspective, doing everything that needs to be done to educate these students, but it doesn’t give you the right as a teacher to impose that on to a student. Parents shouldn’t accept that and we shouldn’t.”

DeSantis had urged legislators to give parents the right to sue school districts that violate the policy. However, that was not included in the bill.

Bill Huizenga (R-MI).

“The IRS’ desire to use facial recognition software should be concerning to every American,” Rep. Huizenga said. “The federal government or a vendor it employs should not be requiring Americans to submit to facial recognition in order to access basic IRS services.”

Specifically, the Facial Authorization Cannot be Enforced (FACE) Act, H.R. 6609, which Rep. Huizenga introduced on Feb. 4, would prevent the IRS from using facial recognition software and storing the faces of American taxpayers in a database, according to a bill summary provided by the congressman’s staff.

Rep. Huizenga also pointed out that the IRS is prone to cyber attacks.

“This database would be a treasure trove of information that could be weaponized by cyber criminals, adversaries such as China or Russia, and based on the past targeting of conservative Americans, even the IRS itself,” he said. “The use of facial recognition technology by the IRS dramatically expands the federal government’s role in data collection and puts the privacy of American taxpayers at far too great a risk.”

Rep. Huizenga’s staff cited two recently published news stories explaining how the IRS plans to require taxpayers to use facial recognition software to access tools and services provided by the IRS through an $86 million contract with ID.me, which on its website says it provides secure identity proofing, authentication and group affiliation verification for government and businesses across sectors.

Several other lawmakers have denounced that contract, as well, including 15 U.S. Senate Republicans, who sent a Feb. 3 letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig questioning him about the IRS-ID.me collaboration.

Firefighters believe there is potential for an explosion of ammonium nitrate and have ordered residents living within a one-mile radius of the Weaver Fertilizer Plant on North Cherry Street to evacuate, WGHP reported.

Winston-Salem Fire Chief Try Mayo told the TV station crews have 'abandoned' the fire-fighting operation due to the large volume on ammonium nitrate at the facility.

Mayo said crews were not able to flow enough water volume to the factory to be 'reasonably certain' they could keep the facility cool enough to prevent a detonation.

The factory has collapsed and authorities are restricting access to the building. No injuries have been reported and the cause of the fire remains unknown.

Firefighters were called to the factory around 7pm Monday night.

The blaze was visible for miles, sending large clouds of black smoke into the night sky. Popping noises could be heard throughout the community, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.

Bystanders watched from nearby parking lots as the flames consumed the plant. However, they were ultimately instructed by police and firefighters to leave the area.

Authorities have closed off the factory with yellow police tape and have shut down the 4400 block of Cherry Street, from North Point Boulevard to Indiana Avenue. Drivers have also been asked to avoid the area.

The calls for evacuations went out around 8:30pm despite the fire appearing to be considerably diminished. Officials were utilizing a reverse-911 procedure to notify residents of the need to flee.

'We need people to get outside of that one-mile radius,' Ed McNeal, Marketing Communications official for the city of Winston-Salem, said in a social media update.

Wake Forest University, located less than two miles from the plant, told WFMY that some students living in off-campus housing near the plant have been told to evacuate.

The impacted areas includes off-campus housing north of Polo Road between Cherry Street and Long Drive.

Those living on campus have not be ordered to evacuate.

School leaders have also invited impacted students to bring a sleeping bag, pillow and/or blanket to the university to shelter in designated areas of campus as temperatures hovered near freezing.

Workers at nearby WestRock Co., a paper and packaging company, were also forced to evacuate their workplace.

WestRock employee Jeff Luman told the newspaper he knew something was wrong when he could smell the smoke coming from the fertilizer plant next door.

'I saw an orange glow, and that is all I needed,' he said.

Firefighters were called to the factory (pictured before the blaze) around 7pm Monday night

The blaze was reportedly visible for miles, sending large clouds of black smoke into the sky. Emergency responders expressed concerns over the fumes being released by the blaze as well as the potential for an explosion

Meanwhile, emergency responders are concerned about the fumes being released by the blaze, as well as the potential for an explosion.

Although ammonium nitrate, which is one of the world's most common fertilizers, isn't flammable itself, experts warn it is a main component in many types of explosives used in mining.

The chemical compound can cause a blast when it is mixed with fuel oil and detonated by an explosive charge. Experts say oxygen must also be present for combustion to occur.

Ammonium nitrate was used by Timothy McVeigh in a terror attack that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.

It can also decompose at high temperatures and create explosive gases such as nitrogen oxide and water vapor. Exposure to extreme heat, such as a fire, is also necessary for the rapid release of gases that can cause an explosion.

Weaver Company Inc., which utilizes the plant, was founded in Norfolk, Virginia in 1929. According to the company's website, the Winston-Salem plant was built in1939 and has been operational since January 1940.

The company specializes in its all-purpose plant food and specialty fertilizer, which is sold at Lowe's stores throughout the southeastern United States.

Winston-Salem police have asked anyone with information about the blaze to call (336) 773-7700 or Crime Stoppers at (336) 727-2800.",Q1

While most of the homeless are obviously in need of help in one form or another, the “tent cities” that they’ve erected are always hotbeds of crime and disease and voters are growing tired of dealing with the potential dangers they pose. From Seattle to Los Angeles and even New York City, homeless encampments are being cleared out, with officials scrambling to find places where the homeless can be dealt with and helped appropriately. But there’s one exception to that rule, and that’s in Baltimore. Maryland officials are now considering a bill that would bar police from clearing people from such public encampments, effectively making the tent cities a permanent fixture of modern life. (Free Beacon)

Some of the nation’s most liberal cities are cracking down on their homeless populations. But Maryland may soon ban police from removing homeless people from public property. A Democratic-backed bill in the Maryland statehouse would prevent police from enforcing Failure to Obey Lawful Orders laws, which critics say would permit homeless camps, known as “tent cities,” on public property. The sponsor of the bill, Democratic delegate Sheila Ruth, said in a committee hearing that these tent cities are not harmful or dangerous to communities. “We shouldn’t be destroying homeless encampments,” Ruth said.

These massive homeless encampments represent a danger not only to the surrounding communities but to the homeless themselves. Assaults and robberies are commonplace and few of the residents have any way to safeguard their few belongings. Prostitution, drug dealing, and robberies are regular occurrences and healthcare options for victims are minimal at best.

So why would Sheila Ruth and her Democratic colleagues be bucking a national trend and trying to prevent previously normal enforcement of Failure to Obey Lawful Orders laws and rules against establishing encampments on public sidewalks and in parks? This once again seems to be a case of the Democratic majority in the state legislature completely ignoring the obvious preferences of the public.

As the linked report reminds us, outgoing Republican Governor Larry Hogan has been aggressively pushing for a new “refund the police” program in his state. Current polling shows that a large majority of voters, including a majority of the residents of Baltimore and African-Americans in the city, strongly support the Governor’s efforts. And yet the state legislature (along with the municipal government of Baltimore) is once again pushing in the exact opposite direction.

I realize I’ve said this before about the Baltimore city government, but it seems to apply to the state legislature as well. When your elected leaders continue to enact bad policies with which you disagree and which make your lives worse, it’s your responsibility to dump them at the ballot box and elect someone more willing to get the job done. But that never seems to happen in Baltimore nor in the state as a whole. They keep sending the same progressive and frequently corrupt partisan players back to office time after time. So whose fault is this situation really? The responsibility rests on the shoulders of the voters. If you don’t like the crime, the violence, and the tent cities clogging your streets, you are the ones to blame for those conditions. And until you start picking better leaders and legislators, you’ll just have to continue to deal with it.",Q1

According to a statement released on Friday, this is part of a review being conducted by DHS Secretary Mayorkas. DHS is reviewing detention facilities “to assess whether their conditions are humane, meet applicable standards, and represent a responsible use of appropriated funding.”

The Alabama detention facility has “a long history of serious deficiencies identified during facility inspections and is of limited operational significance to the agency.” ICE is also ending detentions at Glades County Detention Center in Moore Haven, Florida. There are concerns about medical care at the facility. ICE will stop paying for a “guaranteed minimum” of 300 beds this month. If the county addresses the issues, ICE is open to using the detention center in the future. ICE will also limit the number of detentions at two other facilities – Alamance County Detention Facility in Graham, N.C., and Winn Correctional Center in Winnfield, La. Apparently, Mayorkas is doing all this in a quest to make detaining illegal aliens a kinder and gentler experience.

The statement issued by ICE explains the move for what it calls conditions that are more humane. In May 2021, Mayorkas sent out a memo on illegal immigrant detention. Since then, DHS has “taken significant additional steps to review the detention system, including observations, analysis, and expertise provided by personnel at ICE, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and others.”

ICE detains noncitizens during removal proceedings and pending removal, as required by law or when necessary to ensure public safety or address risk of flight. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas has committed to review detention facilities to assess whether their conditions are humane, meet applicable standards, and represent a responsible use of appropriated funding. The following actions reinforce that commitment: ICE will discontinue use of the Etowah County Detention Center as soon as possible, consistent with the 30-day termination notice requirement and any legal obligations. The Etowah County Detention Center has a long history of serious deficiencies identified during facility inspections and is of limited operational significance to the agency. In recent years, ICE has reduced its use of the Glades County Detention Center, in part due to persistent and ongoing concerns related to the provision of detainee medical care, and because the facility is of limited operational significance. Nevertheless, ICE has continued to pay for a minimum number of beds, many of which the agency has not and likely will not utilize. The agency will not extend the guaranteed minimum beds provision of the agreement. Any future use of the facility will be dependent on fully addressing any conditions that do not meet detention standards. The Alamance County Detention Facility, which is currently used for long-term detention, will only be used for short periods of custody (under 72 hours) if it meets applicable standards. This change is due to limited operational use and concerns about conditions, including a lack of outdoor recreation.

Acting Director Tae D. Johnson says that ICE personnel are being relocated as needed and detainees are being transferred to other facilities. ICE’s reviews of detention facilities will continue.

What ICE doesn’t say in its statement is that the need for these facilities has been reduced to the point that they can be closed or paused in taking in detainees because of Biden’s policies. Last December Biden announced that illegal migrant families would no longer be held in detention facilities. DHS is using tracking technology like ankle bracelets instead of holding detainees. There are no families being held in detention centers. Biden made a campaign promise to end holding families and that is what he did. A quick turnaround process is used and families are released within 72 hours.

The reality is that Border Patrol has released tens of thousands of families without so much as ankle bracelets or any tracking devices. They are released and remain in the United States, blending into communities and going about their lives. It’s no wonder Biden’s border crisis continues. Yet, at a time when illegal migration numbers are up and there are concerns about a “mass migration event” when Biden ends Title 42, Biden is closing facilities. He should be instructing DHS to increase the availability of detention centers, not limiting options. The Spring months are the busy season, if you will, for illegal migration. The Biden administration continues to show they are not serious at all about abiding by current immigration laws. The Biden border crisis is completely self-inflicted.

ICE arrests and deportations are down due to DHS priorities. ICE has been instructed to concentrate on only the most violent of illegal immigrants and on the most recent migrants. The number of immigration arrests and deportations in the interior of the United States fell to their lowest levels in decades last fiscal year. Biden claims this is a humanitarian victory but the truth is it is a public safety threat and a violation of law. Biden prioritizes illegal aliens over American citizens. His open border policies certainly have not eased the crisis on the southern border. It will only get worse as an imminent mass migration event is expected when Biden ends the use of Title 42 at the border.

FILE - This March 18, 2020 file photo taken in Idaho shows a form for the U.S. Census 2020. The Biden White House, on Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022, is calling for the protection of statistical agencies like the U.S. Census Bureau against political interference, at the same time newly-disclosed documents show that the Trump administration tried to exert “unprecedented"" influence on the 2020 census, a historically apolitical head count. (John Roark/The Idaho Post-Register via AP, File)

Original Publication Date January 18, 2022 - 11:46 AM

The Biden White House this month pushed to protect scientific and statistical agencies like the U.S. Census Bureau from political interference in a report issued just days before newly disclosed documents showed the “unprecedented"" extent of the Trump administration's efforts to gain politically from the 2020 headcount.

A report released last week by a White House task force said the American people have a right to expect from their government “accurate information, data, and evidence and scientifically-informed policies, practices, and communications.""

“This requires scientific integrity — based on rigorous scientific research that is free from politically motivated suppression or distortion,"" said the report from the Scientific Integrity Fast-Track Action Committee.

Shortly after the report came out, new documents released over the weekend revealed that political appointees in the Trump administration's Department of Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau, tried to exert unusual influence on the 2020 census, the nation's once-a-decade head count overseen by statisticians, demographers and government bureaucrats. The documents, made public through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Brennan Center for Justice and first reported by The New York Times, showed alarm bells going off within the Census Bureau about efforts by political appointees in the Commerce Department to interfere with the count.

“The department is demonstrating an unusually, high degree of engagement in technical matters, which is unprecedented relative to the previous censuses,"" said a September 2020 email from Ron Jarmin, who was the Census Bureau's deputy director, to other top agency officials.

At the time, Census Bureau officials were under pressure to carry out two orders from then-President Donald Trump.

The first Trump directive ordered that people in the country illegally should be excluded from the state population count used for divvying up congressional seats among the states, also known as the apportionment numbers. Even though the U.S. Constitution mandates that every U.S. resident be counted in censuses, Trump said at the time that including people in the country illegally was “part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of Americans citizens, and I will not stand for it.”

The second directive ordered the Census Bureau to gather citizenship information about every U.S. resident using administrative records after the Supreme Court nixed the Trump administration’s effort to add a citizenship question to the census questionnaire. Critics claim the citizenship question was inspired by a Republican redistricting expert, who believed using citizen voting-age population instead of the total population for the purpose of redrawing of congressional and legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites. The redistricting expert has since died, but some of the guidance he was giving on redistricting has surfaced publicly.

The deadline for the apportionment numbers was at the end of 2020, but in adjusting to delays from the pandemic, the Census Bureau had sought to release them in April 2021. The Department of Commerce was pushing the Census Bureau to finish by the Dec. 31 statutory deadline while Trump was still in the White House in a move that would have cut in half the time originally planned for data processing.

In August 2020, the Trump administration also decided to end the head count a month earlier than the Census Bureau planned to after making schedule adjustments for the pandemic. That decision was challenged by a coalition of municipalities and civil rights groups and led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to end census field operations two weeks earlier than planned. An Inspector General report around that time said the decision to speed up the schedule was not made by the Census Bureau and it could jeopardize a complete head count.

The emails released last weekend show bureau officials were “consistently pessimistic"" about being able to remove people in the country illegally from the apportionment count by the year-end deadline. Other documents from the records release showed that more than two dozens states had signed agreements to share administrative records on public assistance programs with the Trump administration and that Commerce Department officials were communicating with anti-immigrant and conservative think tanks about the census.

President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders upon taking office in January 2021. The apportionment numbers were released in April, and census numbers used for redrawing congressional and legislative districts were made public in August.

The report from the Biden White House task force used the 2020 census as a case study.

“Since census counts are used for the purpose of redistricting and reallocation of representation in the House of Representatives, these challenges to the 2020 census deadline were viewed as political interference that would undermine the integrity of the census counts,"" the report said. “To date, no individuals have been held accountable for these allegations.""

https://dissidentvoice.org/2022/01/a-short-history-of-the-us-pakistan-relationship/,A Short History of the US-Pakistan Relationship,"On January 10, 2022, National Security Advisor (NSA) Moeed Yusuf said, “It [Pakistan] is still not [free from US influence] and I doubt that there is any country which is free from it.” He added that the country does not have any financial independence, being dependent on loans from International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other foreign organizations. “When we cannot [fulfill] the demands, we seek foreign loans. When you procure loans, your economic sovereignty is compromised.” These comments are not entirely stunning; they encapsulate the ambivalent essence of the US-Pakistan relationship. While the Pakistani elite greatly enjoys its self-imposed subservience to the American empire, it never just sits back and rest on its laurels. It continuously tries to exploit what little room for maneuver it has within the bond of servility to further more selfish, regional interests – ones which either demand too much from the patron or don’t neatly align with the US’ hegemonic ambitions.

Anticommunism

Unlike the many postcolonial nations of the time which exuded a great degree of interest in the development of an independent project, Pakistan was totally craven; its creators displayed a surprising lack of enthusiasm in the paraphernalia of sovereignty. They were only interested in somehow securing money, regardless of the consequences which the people would have to face later. Every option was on the table. In The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power, Tariq Ali notes that “the new rulers of Pakistan developed an early communal awareness that to survive they had to rent their country.” Washington was approached as a possible buyer but it rejected the offer to buy Pakistan “as it was busy securing Western Europe and Japan, as well as keeping an eye on China, where the Eighth Route Army was beginning to threaten a Communist victory.” However, this did not stop Pakistan from trying to sell itself.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, continued to consistently market his country as an important ally against Soviet expansionism. Ali remarks that he hysterically “insisted that Soviet agents were present in Kalat and Gilgit in search of a base in Baluchistan.” These same sentiments were shared in a more sophisticated manner by then foreign minister Zafarullah Khan. “[H]e pleaded with the United States to shore up Pakistan, whose people were genetically anticommunist, since this was the best way to protect India against the Soviet Union, which would send its armies through the Khyber Pass.” Pakistan’s persistence in peddling threats about USSR paid off in May 1954 when it signed the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement, through which the US provided resources and training to the Pakistani army, with the general aim of turning the new nation into a pliant Third World state. In September 1954, Pakistan was officially anointed as a crusader against the godless Communists, joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization together with Thailand and the Philippines.

Exactly one year later, in September 1955, Pakistan joined another pro-Western organization known as the Baghdad Pact, which included King Faisal’s Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Britain. As Pakistan chummed up with its anti-Soviet friends, the inflows of money into the ruling class’ pockets increased. From 1953 to 1961, Pakistan received around $2 billion in assistance from the US. These wads of cash, however, did not signify a thoroughgoing bilateral camaraderie, one in which the imperialist benefactor would come to the help of its junior partner at all cost. Apart from acting as another chess piece in the anticommunist game, Pakistan served no other significant function for USA. Therefore, the latter felt no need for fulfilling all the demands of the former. In fact, what happened during the initial years of 1960s was the opposite. In United States and Pakistan in the 21st Century: Geostrategy and Geopolitics in South Asia, Syed Tahseen Raza writes:

The Sino-Indian Border struggle in 1962 paved the way for closer US-India ties because neutral India, desperate to have weapons in the immediate aftermath of Chinese aggression, made a frantic plea for US help. The US was pleased because this was an opportunity to wean India off the influence of the Soviet Union by offering help in a time of crisis. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s inching closer with China was not liked by the United States. When American finally decided to give arms aid to India in November 1962, Pakistan was not consulted before as was promised to them and this deeply offended the leaders of Pakistan. The [John F.] Kennedy administration, on the whole, tried to balance the American relationship with South Asia on equal footing and therefore did not view Pakistan as more important than India.

Feeling threatened by USA’s growing closeness with India, Pakistan extracted from the former, on November 5, 1962, a pledge “that it will come to Pakistan’s assistance in the event of aggression from India.” This pledge, nonetheless, did not help Pakistan during the Second Kashmir War (1965) when it undertook dangerous military adventures (Operation Gibraltar and Operation Grand Slam) against India. When the war started, the US cut aid to both Pakistan and India. A similar situation developed six years later. When New Delhi decisively intervened in East Pakistan’s civil war in late 1971, Washington was unwilling to directly support the Pakistani army’s Operation Searchlight against Bengali insurgents (though it did send part of its Seventh Fleet in the Bay of Bengal). The country’s eastern wing seceded to form the state of Bangladesh, dismembering Pakistan in a humiliating way. Spurred by this defeat, Pakistan’s governing caste realized that the continued existence of the nation was dependent on nuclear parity with India.

The development of nuclear weapons was smoothed by conjunctural reasons. In neighboring Afghanistan, the communists, who had backed the 1973 military coup by Prince Daoud after which a republic was proclaimed, withdrew their support from him. In April 1978, the Shah of Iran convinced Daoud to turn against the communist factions in his army and administration. In response to increasingly harsh state repression, left-wing officers in the military stormed the Presidential Palace in Kabul. The government was turned over to Noor Mohammed Taraki, a communist professor who became the President of the Revolutionary Council of Afghanistan. These developments – which were extensively supported by the USSR – came to be known as the Saur (April) Revolution. The US was terrified. It crafted a subversive plan that made General Zia’s dictatorship in Pakistan a principal node for sending jihadists to Afghanistan. Singularly focused on destabilizing Afghanistan’s communist regime, and, by extension, Soviet Union, USA cared less about Pakistan developing its nuclear programme in the 1980s.

War on Terror

America’s benign attitude toward Pakistan changed with the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the ultimate end of the Cold war. “[S]ans the American aim of defeating communism as their top priority,” comments Raza, “Pakistan was not given any extra consideration.” The “US Intelligence Report,” which had been indicting Pakistan for its nuclear quest, came to be invoked more frequently. When India conducted its Nuclear Test in March 1998, the Bill Clinton administration tried to prevent Pakistan from following suit, offering the resumption of the sale of F-16 aircraft (which had been frozen by George H.W. Bush when he did not certify Pakistan’s non-possession of nuclear devices) and economic and military aid. But Pakistan demanded more. Raza remarks: “Pakistan wanted tough punitive action against India. When the G-8 meeting on 17-18 May 1998 didn’t take very harsh measures against India in accordance with Pakistan’s expectations, bowing to public pressure, Pakistan decided to go for the Nuclear Test, which it ultimately carried out on 28 May, 1998.”

In response to Pakistan’s nuclear test, the US imposed sanctions, which included restriction of the provision of credits, military sales, economic assistance, and loans. These were, nevertheless, limited in scope and were not sustained. US-Pakistan relations exited this period of downturn in an explosive manner after 2001, thanks to the murky dynamics cultivated by imperialism in Afghanistan. After the USSR left in 1988, Pakistan maintained a strong footprint in Afghanistan to gain “strategic depth” against India, continuing to nurture the Islamist extremism that was earlier used to mobilize jihadist fighters from all over the world against USSR. These actions had severe repercussions. When hardhats of jihadism attacked New York in 2001 to express their disgruntlement with America’s bases in Saudi Arabia, the destruction of Iraq and support for Israel, Pakistan was caught in a dilemma. Networks of battle-hardened fighters that it had built along with the USA were now on the attack radar of its imperialist sponsor.

With limited options, Pakistan decided to join the US War on Terror, declaring support for the Hamid Karzai government in Kabul. “By providing the USA with help in the invasion of Afghanistan,” Justin Podur clarifies, “Pakistan was able to save its clients and its own personnel from destruction, as much of the Taliban and al-Qaeda crossed the border to Pakistan or went to ground and Afghanistan was taken over by US-friendly warlords.” This tactical move had its own disruptive consequences for Pakistan’s social osmosis. General Pervez Musharraf came to be accused of treason for supporting the USA against fellow Muslims in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This political effect complicated military operations. As the US and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) made the Pakistan army take action against insurgents operating in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, casualties increased, eroding the state’s legitimacy in the region. When Pakistan cooperated with the insurgents on the sly, it faced US threats.

Conflicts

The convoluted workings of the War on Terror have had a destructive impact on Pakistan’s economy. It has lost $150 billion – 41% or two-fifths of the country’s total economy size, more than the $13 billion that it received from the US between 1999 and 2013. Since the US invasion of Afghanistan, more than 80,000 Pakistani civilians, security forces personnel and women and children have been killed in gun, bomb and suicide attacks. On average, every year Pakistan suffered losses of $7.7 billion – more than the country’s total expenditures on education, health and other social safety schemes. With the growing advance of the Taliban in Afghanistan, current Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post in September 2021, saying: “Since 2001, I have repeatedly warned that the Afghan war was unwinnable. Given their history, Afghans would never accept a protracted foreign military presence, and no outsider, including Pakistan, could change this reality. Unfortunately, successive Pakistani governments after 9/11 sought to please the United States instead of pointing out the error of a military-dominated approach.”

Scarred by the War on Terror, Pakistan has been frustrated to see USA establish an alliance with India as part of an anti-China containment strategy. The US and Indian elites have found a common interest in countering China; India is embroiled in disputes on its land borders with China and the US and its allies are contesting China’s claim to maritime territories across shipping routes in the Indo-Pacific region. It is against this background that Pakistan has returned to China’s “all-weather friendship,” initiated in the 1960s by General Ayub Khan who felt betrayed by Washington’s overtures to India in the aftermath of the Sino-Indian border conflict. China has become Pakistan’s closest strategic ally, supplying it with modern defense equipment. Pakistan supports China’s stance on Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan, and China backs Pakistan on its Kashmir issue with India. Over the past five years, this cooperation has been further cemented by China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its local cognate China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), entailing over $60 billion worth of Chinese investments in infrastructure consisting mostly of loans.

Despite the economic heft of China, Pakistan still needs Washington’s support, both to get disbursements of its $6 billion bailout package from the IMF and to be removed from the terror-financing and money-laundering watchdog Financial Action Task Force’s “grey list,” a designation that encumbers Islamabad’s global financial operations. War on Terror cooperation had converted Pakistan into a major non-NATO ally of the US in 2004, granting it various military and financial privileges. The designation had also eased Pakistan’s access to IMF facilities. With the deterioration of Pakistan’s relationship with USA, accessing funds has become difficult. In October-November 2021, IMF withheld the release of a $1 billion tranche under an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to Pakistan until the government agreed to close commercial bank accounts held by the armed forces and other state entities and remitted $17 billion worth of public funds into a single treasury account. It is believed that USA, the single largest financial contributor to the IMF, had a hand in the reform demands.

In a June 2021 interview on HBO’s documentary news series Axios, Khan had said, “Pakistan will “absolutely not” allow the CIA to use bases on its soil for cross-border counterterrorism missions after American forces withdraw from Afghanistan.” To change this policy decision, USA started using IMF monetary policy as a bargaining chip to force cash-strapped Islamabad to agree to Joe Biden administration’s counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan. These events highlight the conflictual nature of the contemporary US-Pakistan relationship. And it seems that both the parties have failed to arrive at a proper resolution till now. Yusuf’s criticism is significant in this regard as he was the one chosen for mending ties with the US. He has spent a decade or more in the think tank and security policy circle in the US capital as associate vice president for Asia at the Institute of Peace, a US government-backed institution. The Pakistani government had recently elevated him from the position of Special Assistant to the Prime Minister to NSA to signal seriousness in creating a new rapport with the US.

Federal law says parole authority is to be used on a case-by-case basis for ""urgent humanitarian purposes"" and ""significant public benefit."" Typically, only a handful of parole cases are granted by officials, but the Biden administration has been using it more broadly to release tens of thousands of migrants into the interior as it looks to deal with a crisis that has seen monthly encounter numbers at more than 150,000-a-month for nearly a year.

MIGRANT NUMBERS PICKING MIGRANT NUMBERS PICKING UP STEAM AT THE BORDER AS DEMS PUSH BIDEN ADMIN TO END TITLE 42 RESTRICTIONS

Colombian single adults are being returned under Title 42, a public health order used since the Trump administration to expel migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden administration has kept it in place, returning more than half of all migrants encountered at the border in February, but is believed to be considering allowing the order to expire at the end of the month.

CBP said in a statement that those migrants who cannot be expelled under Title 42 and do not have a legal basis to stay in the U.S. are placed in removal proceedings.

""Although some facilities have reached capacity, CBP continues to safely, efficiently and effectively process individuals encountered in the Del Rio Sector,"" a spokesperson said, adding that migrants go thorough background checks in order to continue to keep public safety threats in custody.

DHS PUTS OUT CALL FOR EMPLOYEES TO VOLUNTEER AT SOUTHERN BORDER AMID ‘LARGE NUMBERS' OF MIGRANTS

The new releases come amid reports that the Biden administration is bracing for a dramatic surge in migrants at the border that could eclipse last year’s overwhelming surge -- particularly if the administration ends Title 42.

There were 164,973 encounters in February, compared to 101,099 encounters in February last year, a month that preceded a massive surge in numbers in the spring and summer months. The Washington Post reported this week that preliminary Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data indicates that authorities are on track to have encountered more than 200,000 in March, compared to 173,277 in March last year.

Meanwhile, a top Pentagon official on Thursday told lawmakers DHS had requested additional support from the Pentaton to help deal with a potential increase in migrants, while DHS officials have put out a call to staff to volunteer at the border as the agency says it ""continues to encounter large numbers of individuals at the Southwest Border.""

https://dailytimes.com.pk/889151/pakistan-at-75-a-symbol-of-resilience-with-a-tough-battle-ahead/,Pakistan at 75: A Symbol of Resilience with a Tough Battle Ahead,"The Islamic Republic of Pakistan stands tall at 75 after its independence from British India on 14 August 1947 facing a tougher battle ahead. Pakistan is now the fifth largest country with 220 million people of which nearly 65% are below the age of 35. In view of its immense strategic relevance in the region, Pakistan has large standing armed forces, with nuclear capability to maintain cross-domain deterrence to ensure territorial integrity against a five times larger adversary, India.

Pakistan’s history is replete with moments of internal and external crises and conflicts. No sooner did the country come into being as the world’s largest Muslim state, it faced an unjust distribution of resources and did not get its due share as per the Partition Plan. Similarly, the Boundary Commission, headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, failed to do justice and succumbed to the pressure of Indian leaders and hence, wrongfully awarded the District of Gurdaspur to India instead of Pakistan. This particular award gave direct access to the Indian military into Jammu and Kashmir and gave an upper hand to India over Pakistan when the two nations went to war over the territory. The people of now Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) were denied the Rights of Self-determination by India despite numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and the dispute remains on the UN Agenda even after 75 years.

The Pakistani nation has shown resilience in many other crises and conflicts over the last 75 years of its existence. While the Kashmir conundrum continues, Siachen and Sir Creek disputes have also not been resolved between the arch-rivals.

The low point in Pakistan’s short history came when the India-supported insurgency led to the creation of Bangladesh out of East Pakistan in December 1971. However, the people of Pakistan absorbed the shock and moved on to become a nuclear weapon state to thwart any existential threat.

No sooner did the country come into being as the world’s largest Muslim state, it faced an unjust distribution of resources.

In the domain of diplomacy, Pakistan suffered numerous setbacks when its Cold War ally, the United States (US) imposed military and economic sanctions soon after the 1965 war with India. The on and off relationship with the US continues even today, and Pakistan remains a potential target of its discriminatory policies on matters related to regional affairs.

In spite of these difficulties, Pakistan plays an active role in global politics due to its strategic location at the mouth of the warm waters of the Arabian Sea. The strategic port of Gwadar is being developed by China, as its transnational shipment point for which a China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is being built with Chinese investment and loans, as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It is widely expected that the many Central Asian States, along with Russia will join CPEC, once peace and normalcy return to Afghanistan under the new setup.

Pakistan’s economy is highly vulnerable to international shocks due to ever-widening external debts, and its dependence on foreign assistance to manage the Balance of Payments. Unfortunately, lack of emphasis on indigenisation and low priority given to industrialisation in the last three decades has led to heavy dependence on imported goods and services, which has caused serious current account deficit to as high as USD 20 billion in 2018; and which is now hovering at USD 9 billion.

Moreover, in spite of being an agricultural state due to abundance of land, water, favourable climate and an extremely hard-working rural population, Pakistan has failed to become a major exporter of value-added agricultural produce. Rather, it occasionally needs to import wheat, sugar, and cotton to meet local demand.

The four-decade-long wars and conflicts in Afghanistan have also had a toll on Pakistan’s economy and security, both internally and externally. Pakistan remained a prime target of the Soviet Union during the 1980s when it was supporting the Afghan struggle against Soviet occupation, whereas it became a target of Non-State Actors (NSAs) during US-NATO War on Terror in the post-9/11 environment. Pakistan has suffered immensely on account of the sociocultural and ideological aspects, urban development, civic facilities due to the exodus of refugees, and guns and drugs inflow along with them. Therefore, it is no surprise that Pakistan is leading the call for sustainable peace and development in Afghanistan now that the US and NATO forces have left the war-ravaged country.

While Pakistan may have become a nuclear weapon state, it has fared very poorly in the Human Development Index (HDI). It ranks at the bottom of nearly all major parameters of HDI, as well as on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), judiciary performance, passport ratings, and travel safety standards. This means that a lot needs to be done to convert this attribute of resilience into substantial development of its human resource which is extremely hard working and enterprising. All we need is to set the priorities right and that can be done by carrying out a dispassionate appraisal of the seven-plus decades and set pragmatic targets for the next 25 years. I have no doubt that given the right vision and leadership, this nation will rise to its true potential much sooner than anticipated.

AS high-risk anti-terrorism strategies go, it takes some beating.

A former CIA officer claims Scotland Yard wanted to allow jihadists plotting Britain’s worst-ever terror attack to board jumbo jets with their bombs.

8 Chief jet plotter Abdulla Ahmed Ali pictured in a propaganda video

8 The horrific scene as the second plane targets the World Trade Centre during the 9/11 attack

8 Baker’s son Rashid Rauf, who was around 25 at the time of the plot, rose to become an al-Qaeda terror operations chief and one of the biggest threats to innocent British lives

Met chiefs “wanted to play to the very edge” as they built a case against fanatics who were hell-bent on eclipsing 9/11 by blowing transatlantic planes out of the sky.

But US officials demanded the dangerous ploy be dropped as tensions between the allies hit boiling point.

And in one tense exchange, one angry White House anti-terror supremo told her UK counterparts to make arrests, blasting: “I don’t give a s**t if it blows the case.”

The extraordinary details are revealed in a new book, Disruption, by ex-CIA man Aki Peritz.

The 42-year-old terror expert spent a decade quizzing spies, top White House staffers and government officials to reveal the real story behind the 2006 “jet bombs” plot.

The conspiracy is still seen as the biggest ever to be foiled by MI5, MI6, GCHQ and the Met, aided by US and Pakistani spooks.

Up to 18 suicide bombers hoped to detonate bottle bombs on seven planes at 30,000ft. Experts say the death toll could have been in the thousands, halting global air travel and sparking a worldwide recession.

The attacks would have changed air travel for ever, with passengers still banned from taking liquids over 100ml on to planes 16 years on.

And just last month MI5 boss Ken McCallum told The Sun that smashing the terror cell remained one of the proudest moments in the security service’s history.

He added: “If that had happened, it would have ended in a global shock on the level of 9/11.”

Global carnage

Mr Peritz, who worked on the CIA hunt for Osama Bin Laden, also reveals how Rashid Rauf, the Brummie mastermind behind the plot, was not killed in 2008 as first thought.

Baker’s son Rauf, who was around 25 at the time of the plot, rose to become an al-Qaeda terror operations chief and one of the biggest threats to innocent British lives.

He had meticulously plotted the 7/7 London bombings in 2005, which killed 52, and also directed the failed 21/7 attacks two weeks later.

But after escaping Pakistani custody in 2007 he was reportedly killed by a US Predator drone a year later.

Yet Mr Peritz says spooks now believe Rauf — who he places in the “top ten” of al-Qaeda threats — survived for at least another 12 months, plotting further attacks.

In an exclusive interview, Mr Peritz told The Sun: “Had it been carried out, it would have been catastrophic.

“One very senior CIA official I talked to said they probably could have pulled it off if they had done it in 2002, 2003 or 2004.

“Even if Rauf had done this instead of 7/7 they probably would have gotten away with it because nobody was watching these guys at that time.

“There was very little information about them. Had they dared to dream bigger in 2005 they would have pulled it off, and that’s terrifying to me.”

Disruption tells how British investigators first began to take an interest in the jet bomb cell’s ringleader, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, in May 2005.

Ali, then 24 and father to an eight-month-old son, had travelled frequently to Pakistan, meeting Rauf and learning how to make bombs at al-Qaeda training camps.

8 The London cell, who spent weeks working out how to inject liquid explosives through the bottom of sealed Lucozade bottles to replace the original contents

From June that year, Ali was put under surveillance. Meanwhile Mr Peritz reveals how Rauf — dubbed Mr Talibrum — was planning global carnage even as his 7/7 cell struck in London that summer.

The kingpin and his cohorts realised the wave of attacks meant anyone buying large amounts of a key bomb-making ingredient, hydrogen peroxide, would be red-flagged. Instead, Rauf planned to send his recruits highly concentrated amounts in tiny bottles marked “Rosewater”, which could easily be smuggled across continents by plane.

Mr Peritz says in the book: “The next hurdle for Rauf and his colleagues was to move these rosewater bottles on to an airplane without detection. He personally researched the machines used in airports to detect explosives. Solid explosives were relatively easy to identify in international airports — they showed up as something nefarious and would set off alarms.

“But according to Rauf’s research, liquids were far easier to smuggle on to airplanes. And then the light bulb went on.”

Rauf’s murderous brainwave was passed to the London cell, who spent weeks working out how to inject liquid explosives through the bottom of sealed Lucozade bottles to replace the original contents.

Once filled, they could be taken on board a transatlantic jet completely undetected, then detonated mid-flight.

Investigators watching Ali’s cell knew of its links to Pakistan but still had no idea of their tactics or target.

Years later it emerged al-Qaeda had already carried out a “dry run” elsewhere in the world, flying without explosives to ensure the liquids were not checked.

MI6 first consulted the Americans in spring 2006 as they struggled to fathom the plot. But tensions quickly grew as the US agencies wanted to disrupt the cell immediately.

By contrast, the British were determined to wait to bring them to justice, knowing only a water-tight legal case could lead to hefty jail terms.

Mr Peritz reveals MI6 officers urged top CIA man Jose Rodriguez Jr, Director of the National Clandestine Service: “Don’t rush to judgment, trust us.” Rodriguez replied: “Famous last words.”

The bombers had already filmed their martyrdom videos and were as little as a fortnight from carrying out their deadly plan. But the US was already determined to act

Mr Peritz reveals how US officials finally “lost their minds” in early summer 2006 after covert audio probes picked out talk about “California”, “Dallas” and “Chicago”.

For the CIA, whose motto was “Every day is September 12”, it sparked a major problem.

Tipping point

Mr Peritz quotes Fran Townsend, President Bush’s Homeland Security Advisor, recalling: “It felt like August 2001 on steroids.”

Unbeknown to investigators, the plotters had already listed seven flights between Heathrow and six US and Canadian cities — San Francisco, Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, Washington and New York.

The bombers had already filmed their martyrdom videos and were as little as a fortnight from carrying out their deadly plan. But the US was already determined to act.

Mr Peritz reveals how President Bush was now calling Townsend twice a day, asking: “Are you comfortable letting the planes fly?” and demanding the UK make arrests.

CIA boss Michael Hayden was also “alarmed by British reticence”, telling the head of MI6: “Let’s just do it!”

But British intelligence agencies and Scotland Yard stayed calm in the face of the growing storm, even floating the idea of letting the bombers board aircraft before being arrested.

Even so the tipping point had been reached and Mr Peritz writes: “The CIA’s (Deputy Director) Steve Kappes noted, ‘In the post-9/11 environment, if Rashid Rauf was a threat, then we’d take action against him.’ The minute they found Rauf, they were going to grab him.

“The American view was, ‘Our citizens. Our planes’.” In the second week of August 2006 top CIA chiefs made the call that would blow the operation. Intelligence revealed that Rauf was on the move in Pakistan and they asked their Pakistani counterparts to arrest him.

US officials made the decision without first informing the UK, sparking fury. Rauf’s arrest triggered a wave of swoops across London and in High Wycombe, Bucks, with cops fearing that the plotters would realise their mastermind had “gone dark”.

A total of 24 people were held on the night of August 9, 2006. Seven were later convicted, including Ali. But Rauf remained a mystery.

He could not be extradited to the UK and mysteriously escaped from Pakistani custody while being transported by armed guard between court hearings in December 2007.

Despite the reports of his death in a 2008 drone strike Mr Peritz says spooks are now certain he survived, planning further plots — including one targeting then-PM Gordon Brown. He is now thought to have died in a 2009 Pakistani missile strike.

Mr Peritz believes Rauf’s 2007 escape “partially” pushed the US to act alone in its strike against Bin Laden in 2011 without informing Pakistan because of the loss of trust.

He told The Sun: “Rashid Rauf was so valuable to al-Qaeda that they allowed him a free hand.

“He had the connections to people who knew how to build bombs, he had people who wanted to kill and he put them all together and sent them back to the West.

“The fact that he was on the radar for such a long time — especially after 7/7, and we didn’t really catch this cell until 13 months later — well, that’s really quite remarkable.”

SWAIN COUNTY, North Carolina (WLOS) — A spokesperson with the North Carolina Forest Service said Sunday, March 27 that firefighters are making significant headway on two wildfires burning since Saturday afternoon in Swain County.

The smell of smoke was thick in the air near Bryson City on Sunday. According to District 9 Forester Ruthie Edwards, the Thomas Divide Complex Fire is comprised of two separate wildfires: the Stone Pile Fire and the Cooper Creek Fire. She said both were caused by fallen trees on power lines.

“That type of fire is very common when we have high winds,” Edwards said.

Saturday night, the fires had burned an estimated 100 acres and were 10% contained.

By Sunday night, the fires reached a combined total of 700 acres and were 30% contained. Despite windy conditions, Edwards said they are not expected to grow.

“We have definitely turned the corner on containing the fire,” Edwards said. “I think that we look to see a lot of improvement [Sunday night] with the relative humidity rising.” According to Edwards, no one has been injured and there has been only one report of minor damage to a home. Evacuation orders issued on Saturday have since been lifted.

Swain County residents Don Parks and Cora Fuller were forced to leave their house after fire crews came knocking.

“They said we needed to get out of there,” Parks recalled.

Fuller said it was her nose that first alerted her to the fire.

“I smelled smoke and I thought, ‘Oh my Lord.’ I went outside and the whole mountainside was just white, and I could see orange and pink color coming up,” Fuller said. “You couldn’t hardly see anything and, man, I was terrified.”

Fuller and Parks loaded their dogs Tootsie, Ash and Scruffy into their truck and headed to a family member’s house. Parks said his anxiety was through the roof on the drive back Sunday morning.

“I didn’t know what to expect,” Parks said. “So, it was great to see it in one piece.”

Relieved, the couple said they’re eager to get a good night’s sleep.

“I’m ready to go home and crash out,” Fuller said with a smile.

On Sunday afternoon, 60 firefighters continued to battle the flames, said Edwards.

“This is just old fashioned hard work,” Edwards said. “They’re all just digging hand line, and it can be slow and tedious — and it’s steep and hard work.”

Attempts to bring in additional resources were blocked over the weekend by mother nature, she added.

“We had a scout plane and a helicopter come over from the North Carolina Forest Service, and both came here and tried to do some work, but the winds were too strong,” Edwards said. “We weren’t able to use them.”

According to Edwards, they will attempt to operate with a skeleton crew overnight to give firefighters a rest before tackling the flames again Monday morning.

SmartAsset looked at 366 cities and ranked them in terms of the total number of breweries, breweries per 100,000 residents, the average number of beers per brewery, bars per 100,000 residents, and the average price of a pint.

When you add all of the numbers together, you find Rapid City at number 30 on the list.

South Dakota's second-largest city made the top 30 despite having only seven breweries in town. Only Appleton, Wisconsin (4); Athens, Georgia (5); Bloomington, Indiana (5); Lawrence, Kansas (6); and Springfield, Illinois (6) had fewer.

That small number of breweries also gave Rapid City one of the smallest selections among cities in the top 30, just 28.6 beers per location. Only Springfield, Illinois (17.8) and Spokane, Washington had fewer options to choose from.

One of the biggest things working in Rapid City's favor was cost. The average pint of beer was just $3.25, which is tied for the third-lowest among all of the cities in the top 30.

(Nebraska Examiner) — Students at the Nebraska State Capitol on Thursday demanded action on gun safety and called on the Legislature to halt efforts on a “permitless” concealed carry bill.

Various organizations, including Nebraskans Against Gun Violence, Huskers Against Gun Violence and Students Demand Action, connected Thursday’s news conference to National Walkout Day on March 14, 2018. On that day five years ago, nearly 3,000 students from coast to coast, including at schools from Omaha to North Platte in Nebraska, walked out of their classrooms.

Students demanded action because of the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people.

“Today, five years after students walked out of their schools, we walked into this Capitol building to demand that our legislators turn away from the extreme policies of NRA executives and prioritize common sense gun laws,” said 18-year-old Jayden Speed. “We must prioritize saving lives, not more guns. We cannot look away from this crisis.”

‘National epidemic’

Speed, who founded the Nebraska chapter of Students Demand Action, said he got involved in preventing gun violence at 13 years old in 2018 during those walkouts.

“Many of us were shaken by the very idea that our schools were a target in the national epidemic of gun violence,” Speed said.

Simone Hill said she founded Huskers Against Gun Violence because she was “tired of feeling powerless again.” Hill walked out in 2018 and said Thursday that youth voices need to be uplifted “now more than ever before.”

Speed, Hill and Melody Vaccaro, the executive director of Nebraskans Against Gun Violence, noted that gun violence is now the leading cause of death among children. Before 2020, deaths in motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death.

Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas, shooting last year, the first major legislation in nearly 30 years to combat gun violence.

However, Vaccaro said more must be done, including in Nebraska.

Vaccaro said senators are prioritizing legislation such as Legislative Bill 77, proposed by State Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon, as the number of bills able to be passed this session remains small.

“It is ghoulish. It is monstrous,” Vaccaro said. “And the children of Nebraska, the children of the United States, we all deserve better.”

Freshman senator vows to fight

LB 77 is Brewer’s long-fought effort to pass permitless concealed carry, which became central to Thursday’s news conference. Brewer’s bill passed the first of three required rounds of debate on March 3.

Brewer has stated his bill is intended to “clean up the laws” so people can more easily protect themselves and their families or business.

State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, who led the eight-hour filibuster against LB 77, said constituents need to demand that their senators vote no on Brewer’s bill because it would increase accessibility to guns.

Raybould instead voiced support for LB 482, the Suicide Risk Protection Order Act she proposed. The act would allow a court to intervene when a person has access to a firearm, has made threats of violence and is a danger to themselves or others.

Similar laws exist in at least 19 states and are sometimes referred to as “red flag” laws.

The Judiciary Committee considered the legislation Feb. 10, but there has been no movement.

“You are the greatest advocates in the world to help educate my fellow state senators on how important this issue [is], how important it is to the future of our state of Nebraska,” Raybould told students Thursday.

Raybould added that it is unacceptable for senators keeping their “head in the sand and ignoring the facts” about how students feel about their safety.

“We have to do more than what we’re doing now,” Raybould said.

Unsafe at school

La-Nayia Robinson, a junior at Lincoln High School, said she attended various schools that have had to put up protections for gun violence.

“Children shouldn’t be so scared of something that shouldn’t be an issue for them,” La-Nayia said.

Leah Nelson, an Omaha fifth-grader, talks about feeling unsafe in her school because of guns on Thursday, March 16, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)

Leah Nelson, a fifth-grader from Omaha, said she is scared every day to go to school, worried there may be a threat similar to the drills that her school facilitates.

Fifth graders such as her, Leah said, should not have to be concerned with how to get out of the building in the case of a shooting or be thinking of shootings generally.

“I feel really unsafe at school sometimes,” Leah said. “I feel like it’s unreasonable, and it’s just really scary.”

Laura Roberts, an elementary teacher in Lincoln, said students do ask about school shootings when they occur.

Roberts said that whenever there is a safety drill, she spends the rest of the day calming down her elementary students, not able to get any work done “because everybody is so freaked out.”

“The kids are not OK, and we should not be OK with this situation,” she said.

‘Itty bitty faces’

Maghie Miller-Jenkins said she has come to the Legislature multiple times this session to try to get senators to see the “humanity” in what they’re doing.

“There shouldn’t be a market for safety vests for children who are going to elementary school,” Miller-Jenkins said. “I shouldn’t worry about having to tell my 5-year-old that she needs to be prepared to hide under a desk for any reason other than tornado drills.”

Miller-Jenkins said that as she grew up in the 1980s, the only drills she practiced were for tornadoes and fires.

While speaking, Miller-Jenkins’ daughter, Atlyss, held onto her mother’s leg before her mother picked her up:

“[Legislators] need to look at these itty bitty faces because these little itty bitty faces are the faces on memorials. These itty bitty faces are the faces that parents have to be left remembering because they can only identify their children by their shoes,” Miller-Jenkins said.

“Your thoughts and prayers mean nothing,” she said, “because we’re still burying babies.”

Suzanne Morphew was last seen alive the afternoon of May 10, 2020 as she left her home in Chaffee County for a bike ride.

The missing mother’s disappearance prompted a widespread search effort and investigation, ultimately culminating in the arrest of her husband, Barry Morphew. He was charged earlier this year with tampering with physical evidence and an attempt to influence a public servant as well as murder, even though Suzanne’s body has not been found.

Barry Morphew

Morphew’s attorneys have since requested the charges against him be dropped, citing the skepticism voiced by Former Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Agent Joseph Cahill, once a co-lead investigator in the case.

During a December interview with internal affairs investigators, Cahill said he told supervisors there wasn’t enough evidence to arrest Morphew, according to court documents obtained by 9News on Tuesday. The motion to dismiss was initially filed on Feb. 9.

Cahill also said he voiced his concerns to supervisors and Chaffee County Sheriff John Spezze before taking Morphew into custody.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/938785-a-return-to-terror,A return to terror,"Horror visited Peshawar once again on Friday – this time in a Shia mosque in the city’s Qissa Khawani bazaar area during Friday prayers. With a high death toll and an even higher number of injured in the cowardly suicide attack, Peshawar – a city traumatised over and over again in the past few decades – once again saw the worst of terror, unleashed seemingly with ease. Scenes of mayhem and intense grief could be seen at the Lady Reading Hospital where the victims were taken. Once more, we see relatives mourn. Once more, we hear stories of people searching for bodies of their loved ones. Once more, we see images of bloodied survivors and those that are forever lost to a mindless hatred. And, once more, we hear statements of condemnation from the government and its representatives. According to what we know so far, two bombers entered the area, shot dead one of the policemen on duty, while the suicide bomber, who was a part of the duo, entered the mosque and detonated his device.

Regardless of which group is responsible for the attack, this attack clearly shows that our war against militancy is far from over. For every attack the state is able to thwart – and there is a long list of potential attacks that have been prevented – there is one such terror attack that strikes at the heart of a community. We had hoped to never again see those days in the early 2000s when terror attacks occurred on a regular basis, across the country. But we appear, once more, to be returning to those times. Militancy in the form of the TTP or the Islamic State of Khorasan or any of their allies is obviously a national problem, and while they attack indiscriminately, they bear a particular animosity for the Shia community that has been ruthlessly targeted since the 1980s with hundreds of sectarian attacks on places of worship in the last 15 years. From the Hazara Shia community that has suffered immense loss over the years to attacks such the one on Friday, sectarian-based terror has continued. This raises the questions of why the government has not done more to provide security to imambargahs or Shia mosques, especially on Fridays when militants are most likely to strike so that they can cause maximum casualties.

We also ask at this point, what has become of the National Action Plan worked out after the APS killings in December 2014. It doesn’t seem much has been achieved if terrorists can still kill at will and act without being deterred. The National Action Plan was intended to stop this. In the aftermath of this attack, the state has to dispassionately judge how well it has implemented the National Action Plan. While there have been successes in defeating militant groups in Fata, NAP was meant to be broader than just military operations. We were supposed to root out not just extremist groups but the extremist mindset that has flourished in the country. Pakistan’s security problems have continued for far too long. Some strategy needs to be devised to bring them to an end. While the interior minister instantly laid blame on the external forces, the fact is that these external forces would have needed inside help. We need to track down where that help came from, and how the attack was planned. We have to face this fact and move forward in a direction that can bring an end to the violence we now face once again, and which further destabilises an already shaky country. The war against militancy cannot be fought only on the battlefield. Defensive measures are especially essential to protect a vulnerable population. So far, the state has failed in this very basic of its duties. What we need is a refocus on combining the best of intelligence gathering with all that NAP was meant to do. It is only then that something as routine and regular as people congregating to pray does not end in the worst tragedy of their lives.",Q1

“We are angry and we are saddened,” landlord Brian Chin said. A memorial was shattered in a community already shattered by the killing of Christina Yuna Lee. “They targeted her memorial,” Chin said. Chin found the remnants in front of the Chrystie Street building Wednesday morning. “The street of full of smashed glass, candles knocked over, the signs were ripped off, flowers were scattered over the sidewalk,” Chin said. Chin immediately cleaned it up the damage that was left behind. “We retaped the signs to the trees, we wrote new messages, we replaced candles, we placed more flowers,” Chin said.

Former NYPD Commissioner Howard Safir blasted New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg for allowing Assamad Nash, a homeless man who had been arrested 5 times in the last year for various offenses, including assaulting a subway rider, to walk free due to liberal bail policies.

Fox News:

“You have a district attorney who has made it clear that he’s not going to prosecute criminals, that he is more involved in social justice than justice for criminals. We have a no-bail law which lets people out. I just noticed in the paper this morning a shoplifter arrested 167 times. That just points out what’s wrong with the criminal justice system when somebody is arrested 167 times and is out on the street. We need to reform bail and make sure that judges can hold people in jail if they’re a danger to the community.”

Safir had specific ideas about how to battle the violence.

“We have to go back to what made New York the safest large city in America in the late 90s and 2000s. We have to go back to stop, question and frisk. We have to go back to that sort of policing. We have to restore qualified immunity to police officers so they’re not afraid to do their jobs. We have to go back to what worked and it’s not working now. And if we don’t change things, New York is going to go right back to the bad old days of the 70s and 80s.”

That’s exactly where New York is headed. However, those policies are controversial, and some policies, like “stop and frisk,” have been declared unconstitutional.

But Safir is talking less about specifics and more about an attitude on the part of the police and the politicians who are supposed to have their backs. There must be less tolerance for violence no matter what color the perpetrator.

Otherwise, New York will become as unlivable as Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are getting to be.",Q1

Celina landmark to include restaurant, bar

By William Kincaid

CELINA - The James Watson House, a restaurant and bar named after Celina founder James Watson Riley, is expected to open later this year on Main Street.

It will be housed in the first floor of a 140-year-old downtown building that was once facing demolition but has since undergone substantial structural upgrades.

The eatery will serve up steaks, fresh seafood and other classic American foods, beer, cocktails and spirits, all while adding fuel to a downtown revitalization.

Chris and Cassie Campbell, co-owners of the award-winning restaurant The Merchant House in Greenville, will operate The James Watson House, according to building owners Michael Hoying and Phil Moeller.

Hoying, a St. Henry native, is vice president and partner of Dayton-based construction business Brackett Builders. Moeller lives in Maria Stein and owns Moeller Real Estate. The restaurant and bar alone reflects an investment of $1.13 million and will create 20 full-time equivalent jobs, according to city documents.

""The James Watson House will be the perfect addition to our 202 Main Street Building and the downtown Celina area,"" Hoying said. ""It's a great feeling knowing your partnering with a team that not only delivers a quality product but cares equally about the experience provided to the community.""

Hoying and Moeller, who own the the new restaurant and bar along with the Campbells, gave the newspaper a tour of the building this week. The two men will focus their efforts on developing the restaurant before turning their attention to the building's second and third floors that will house commercial, retail or office tenants.

""That's really going to drive almost the design for the rest of the floors so we wanted to do that first,"" Hoying said of the restaurant, noting the three levels will interact act with and compliment one another.





The James Watson House

The James Watson House aims to offer new-American style foods such as house-aged steaks, fresh seafood, sandwiches, pastas, salads and other American classics, Chris Campbell said.

""Here will be some of those American classics with kind of a James Watson feel to them,"" he said. ""There'll be a twist to it using local ingredients.""

The owners also plan for an expansive bar with more than 20 beers on tap, cocktails and spirits.

""You want to be that place where people can go just for after work and maybe for just a bite to eat for lunch but you also want to be that first place people think of when they have a special occasion,"" Chris Campbell said. ""We want to kind of be both. We want to be that place where you can just get a bite. We also want to be that place where you can sit for two hours, have a couple nice cocktails, have a great steak and celebrate a special occasion.""

Cassie Campbell said The James Watson House will not only be a place to drink and dine but an experience unto itself informed by the service, ambience and aesthetic. She described the eatery as rustic industrial with modern flourishes.

The owners also took note of the building's ""charming exterior, high ceilings and raw material originally found in the space.""





A perfect match

Photo by Paige Sutter/The Daily Standard The restaurant also will include a large outdoor patio on the north side of the building for dinning and drinking.

When Moeller and Hoying, working as 202 South Main St., LLC, purchased the building, they had in mind offering food service. They sought out the people behind one of their favorite restaurants, The Merchant House in Greenville.

""We've always loved going there, first and foremost. We've always had the vision for the first floor to have a restaurant in use,"" Hoying said. ""Being a customer of theirs and just loving the product they put forth, we reached out actively to them just to see if they had any interest.""

Plus, the Merchant House just happened to be located in a historic building with architectural elements and building dimensions similar to the 202 Main Street building, Hoying said.

The Campbells, it turned out, were seeking to branch out.

""Chris and I have since we opened the Merchant House always wanted to do multiple restaurants,"" Cassie Campbell said, adding the two have more than 40 years of combined restaurant experience. ""We've been actively looking at other options for while.""

Upon sitting down with Moeller and Hoying, the parties immediately hit it off and the Campbells realized they had found an ideal avenue for taking on another restaurant.





Rich with history

The Merchant House, which the Campbells founded in 2015 with Georgianne and Randy Lambright, is the three-time winner of Ohio Magazine's Best Casual Dinning Award, according to a news release issued by Moeller.

The building at 202 Main Street has formerly operated as an opera house, cigar factory, grocery and Lininger Brothers Big Bargain Hardware. The downtown fixture fell into a state of disrepair over the years.

City safety service director Tom Hitchcock sent a letter dated Feb. 26, 2019, to the former owners notifying them the building was unsafe, citing violations that included interior or exterior walls or other vertical structural elements that list, lean or buckle. The owners were ordered to make necessary repairs to make the building safe or to raze and remove it. Failure to do so would have resulted in the city's assumption of repairs or demolition.

Not wanting to lose a historic downtown building, county officials reached out to the state and learned of the Target of Opportunity Program run through the Ohio Development Services Agency.





A new future

Submitted Photo County community development director Jared Ebbing on behalf of the county successfully applied for a $250,000 grant. The owners were required to provide a 20% match. The building was rehabilitated.

With assistance from a $195,000 county revolving loan and other sources, Moeller and Hoying working as 202 South Main St., LLC purchased the building and made interior improvements. They planned to open a food service business on the first floor and mixed use on the upper floors.

""We see the momentum, a lot of positive activity going on whether that's different restaurants, different boutiques,"" Moeller said. ""There's a lot of positive momentum and we want to kind of fit into that.""

Though the building is now structurally sound, its three floors must now be refurbished.

""In addition, the team plans to work original parts of what is reported to be one of the first elevators in Mercer County and other building contents into the improvements,"" the release states.

With Brackett Builders, Hoying has overseen high profile restorations, among them the Delco Lofts project in downtown Dayton involving a sixth floor corner office and the addition of 133 loft apartments, parking and brewery space in the Water Street District.

""We've done a lot of work in downtown Dayton and Columbus throughout Central Ohio,"" Hoying said. ""I always had a passion for these types of projects so to see them restored, brought back to life, it's just awesome to be a part of it.""

The two thanked Celina officials for their help in facilitating the project.

""When you're working with business friendly communities, cities, municipalities, it's going to continue to grow and we're excited to be a part of that,"" Moeller said.",Q1
https://www.businessinsider.com/new-oligarchs-russia-putin-seizure-nationalization-western-assets-2022-3,"A new class of oligarchs could rise from Putin's seizure of Western assets, says an expert in Russian finance","Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to take over assets of foreign companies that leave the country.

The assets could be auctioned off, Russia's Economy Ministry has suggested.

A fire sale of the assets could create a new class of oligarchs, said a Russian finance expert.

Russia has announced it's considering seizing the assets of foreign companies that exit the country — and it could create a new class of oligarchs, an expert on Russian finance told Insider.

Those who manage to acquire ownership of seized assets at fire-sale prices through state auctions could become the new class of tycoons, said Hassan Malik, a senior sovereign analyst at Boston-based investment management consultancy Loomis Sayles.

""There's certainly a risk that you just see the creation of a new class of crony capitalists or oligarchs,"" Malik told Insider.

As international companies exit Russia en masse, they are leaving behind assets such as factories and offices that are in working condition. Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to take over such idle but productive assets, telling government officials the Kremlin would seek to ""introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who actually want to work,"" according to the Associated Press.

Russia's Economy Ministry has suggested the assets could be auctioned off, Bloomberg reported on March 10. The auctions could mirror a controversial 1990s ""loans-for-shares"" program launched by former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, Malik told Insider. At the time, rich Russian businessmen and banks close to the authorities lent the government money in exchange for stakes in state-owned industrial companies. The shares were acquired at ""dirt-cheap prices,"" The New York Times wrote in 1996.

Malik described the deals as ""sweetheart deals"" because when the Russian state ""predictably defaulted"" on the loans, the creditors seized their shares. This created a generation of outrageously rich oligarchs, said Malik, who is also the author of ""Bankers and Bolsheviks,"" a book about finance in the early 1900s during the Russian Revolution.

Russia's richest man, Vladimir Potanin, built up his vast fortune through the ""loans-for-share"" scheme when he acquired metals giant Nornickel. Potanin has a net worth of $24.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Billionaire Roman Abramovich (net worth $14.5 billion) acquired a controlling stake in oil company Sibneft through the program.

Today, the Russian government — in need of funds amid sweeping international sanctions over the Ukraine war — could offload seized foreign assets to favored investors at a discount again, Malik told Insider. ""I think it's a real risk given Russia's history,"" he said.

Some foreign investors could be eyeing Russia

The Kremlin may also open such auctions up to foreign players, which could entice opportunistic investors eyeing a way into the market, said Malik.

""There may be players from countries where they feel relatively insulated from the threat of Western sanctions,"" he said.

Potential investors could hail from China, India, or countries in the Middle East that have not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, said Malik.

Among them, China is most likely to take an active role in pursuing investments in Russia, as it has more leverage in its power relations with the West than do many other countries, said Malik. Large, state-owned companies are unlikely to take the risk of running afoul of international sanctions, but investors could set up a holdings company that only operates and trades in China and Russia to get around restrictions, he said.

China appears to be eyeing opportunities in the Russian market already.

Chinese ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, told a group of business leaders in Moscow on Sunday to seize opportunities presented by a ""void"" in the country, the Russia Confucius Culture Promotion Association wrote on its official WeChat account.

Zhang did not mention sanctions, but told business leaders the international situation was ""complex,"" with large companies facing issues in supply chains and payments. ""This is a time when private, small- and medium-sized enterprises can play a role,"" said Zhang.

On this particular Sunday afternoon – Jan. 3, 2021 – the topic was darker and much more urgent.

Members of so-called “patriot” and militia groups from across Pennsylvania and New Jersey strategized about how they would communicate with each other in the event of a major catastrophe. The failure of the electrical grid. An epic natural disaster. An armed clash with their own government.

Many in the room believed the collapse of American society was ""inevitable,"" that the American political process was broken.

The meeting, described in detail for the first time by two participants, plays a central role in the federal government’s prosecution of a New Jersey man, James Breheny, who attended that meeting and was caught on video storming the U.S. Capitol three days later, during the armed insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.

The new details, obtained through months of reporting, provide the clearest picture to date of the mysterious Jan. 3 gathering in southern Lancaster County, which has been the subject of intense speculation since it was first disclosed in a federal criminal complaint related to the insurrection.

While the participants who spoke to LNP | LancasterOnline said the Quarryville meeting’s objectives were broad and focused on communication tactics – the group talked about the best handheld satellite radios and amateur radio bands to use in any emergency – they also acknowledged that some, including Breheny, spoke of traveling to the nation’s capital to attend then-president Donald Trump’s planned “Stop the Steal” rally.

“I know I heard one or two people were interested in (coordinating Jan. 6 communications),” said one of the participants. He said Breheny and others asked questions about specific communications plans for Jan. 6 after a slideshow presentation on communications techniques.

“That whole meeting had nothing to do with Jan. 6. It could have fed into it, but that wasn’t the purpose,” the participant said.

He confirmed the time, location and other details of the Quarryville meeting on the condition he not be identified because he did not want to be targeted by others in attendance that day. LNP | LancasterOnline granted him anonymity because the details he provided could not otherwise be obtained.

A reporter independently corroborated many of the details with Solanco Fairgrounds staff and a second participant.

In addition, a top state Oath Keepers official told LNP | LancasterOnline that he has evidence participants in the Quarryville meeting were sharing a list that day of supplies to carry to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6. The list included cargo vans, survival kits and medical supplies, he said.

LNP | LancasterOnline was not able to determine whether others who attended the Quarryville meeting joined Breheny in traveling to Washington, D.C., three days later. The participants who spoke about the Jan. 3 meeting said they did not go to the nation’s capital on Jan. 6.

Disputing links to Jan. 6

Regardless of the Quarryville meeting’s stated objective, it is clear that at least some of the participants inside the Solanco Fairgrounds’ Hoffman Building were preparing for events similar to those that would take place three days later.

A slideshow presentation, obtained by LNP | LancasterOnline in recent weeks, instructed the group on the tactics of “4th & 5th Generation Warfare.” It stated, in part: “A resistance force to a larger, well equipped military force needs to be light and agile. We are likely not going to be able to compete with money, technology, numbers of troops.

The slideshow did not refer to plans for Jan. 6. But federal law enforcement officials allege Breheny, an Oath Keeper, described the Quarryville gathering as a crucial planning session for Trump’s rally in Washington, D.C.

Story continues below PowerPoint.

Editor's Note: The PowerPoint was provided to LNP|LancasterOnline on the condition that certain information in it not be released. Between slides 17 and 18, six slides that contained personally identifiable information were removed. They explained Winlink messaging, the Automatic Packet Reporting System, JS8Call and WebSDR. One slide between slides 19 and 20 — which showed the Garmin InReach web app — was also removed because of personally identifiable information. Three slides at the end of the presentation — which were a recommendation for what licensed/unlicensed tools were best as well as a ""Comms Schedule"" which showed specific frequencies — were also removed.

“This will be the day we get our comms on point with multiple other patriot groups, share rally points etc. This one is important and I believe this is our last chance to organize before the show,” Breheny wrote to Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes, according to federal charging documents. “This meeting will be for leaders only.”

Rhodes did not attend the Quarryville meeting.

Les Mahan, a Chester County resident who rented the Solanco Fairgrounds building for the meeting, said most attendees were interested in “prepping” for natural disaster or societal collapse, and that radio communications is a vital component of those plans.

He said that after a slideshow presentation as people prepared to leave, one attendee stood up and asked that anyone planning to go to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 share their phone numbers. Mahan said about half a dozen people did so.

“I don’t think many people from the meeting went (to Washington, D.C.) because I don’t think many people were interested,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that one guy who attended the meeting (Breheny) did something stupid. Literally out of everyone, there was only one guy (who got arrested at the Capitol).”

Mahan, who lives about 19 miles southeast of Quarryville in Oxford, Chester County, described himself as a “prepper” but said he is not a member of a militia. He said planning for the Quarryville meeting began in mid-December, prior to when he said he saw a Jan. 1 tweet by Trump inviting supporters to the capital.

“There was a lot of info out there in 2020 about election fraud and martial law, and of course it was nonsense, but there were a lot of guys who were talking about getting food” to prepare for such a breakdown, he said. “That was a lot of the conversation (at that meeting) ... being worried about martial law.”

He added that similar meetings — where communications and disaster preparations — are held frequently, including recently in Oxford, and that they are open to anyone who wants to come.

Breheny’s attorney, Harley Breite of Paterson, New Jersey, similarly denied the objective of the Quarryville meeting was to plan for an assault on the U.S. Capitol.

“The meeting had nothing to do with January 6,” Breite said. “My client is an expert in communications – HAM radio, that type of thing – and what my client was trying to do was to help secure communications lines in case of some natural emergency or some power failure.”

Breite said his client was asked to attend the Quarryville meeting by northern New Jersey Oath Keepers director Edward Durfee Jr. Durfee declined to comment when contacted by LNP | LancasterOnline.

Breite said his client asked other attendees of the Quarryville meeting if they were going to Washington, D.C., three days later, but said his client did not discuss how different groups would communicate that day.

Breheny was indicted in May by the FBI on a charge of illegally entering the U.S. Capitol and impeding an official proceeding. The mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol tried to stop the routine, ceremonial certification of election results that showed Democrat Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election.

The investigation

Quarryville Borough officials confirmed that the Jan. 3 meeting took place at the Solanco Fairgrounds.

Clark Bearinger, Quarryville’s police chief at the time, said one of his officers noticed a large group meeting in the Hoffman Building that day. He added that it’s not unusual for fairgrounds buildings to be used by outside groups.

Bearinger, who is now a magisterial district judge, said the FBI called him in the spring to ask about the meeting. He said he referred the FBI to borough manager Scott Peiffer, who also serves as the general manager of the fair association.

Peiffer and Bearinger both said they were not aware of the exact nature of the meeting.

“We don’t typically ask what groups rent the building; we just get a calendar,” Peiffer said.

He told the FBI the group paid cash; the building costs between $350 and $475 to rent.

The FBI declined to comment.

A leader in Pennsylvania’s Oath Keepers organization, who said he did not attend the Quarryville meeting, told LNP|LancasterOnline that he saw evidence that participants did, in fact, talk about how to prepare for potential violence in Washington, D.C., three days later.

Hons Garrison, who was serving as the Pennsylvania Oath Keepers’ state membership director at the time and, until December, was the group’s president, said he was shown a photograph of meeting notes listing bulleted items needed for Jan. 6, including two cargo vans, walking sticks, survival kits vehicles and “e packs,” or medical emergency kits. Garrison would not provide the photo to LNP | LancasterOnline.

“What I heard was it was a planning meeting (for Jan. 6) – where we’re going to be, where we’re going to stay, where we’re going to meet up if we get split up,” Garrison said.

LNP | LancasterOnline could not independently verify his account; the two attendees who spoke with the newspaper said Jan. 6 was only mentioned in passing.

Garrison said his members were not in attendance, and court records show no one publicly associated with the Pennsylvania Oath Keepers has been arrested in connection to the Jan. 6 riots.

The House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack recently subpoenaed leaders of the national Oath Keepers organization, seeking documents and testimony concerning their role in the riots. A spokesperson for the committee did not respond to a request for comment on whether the Quarryville meeting is part of the panel’s investigation.

The committee is planning to begin holding more public hearings this year, with the hopes of producing a report by the summer.

https://classicrock1051.com/maurice-mom-drink-and-drive/,Maurice Mom’s Emotional Plea: Don’t Drink and Drive,"A grieving Maurice mother who lost her step-daughter in a drunk driving incident earlier this year made an emotional plea on social media: please don't drink and drive.

Kristi Baumgardner made the post on the 2-month anniversary of the death of her step-daughter, Ramsie Kate Baumgardner, who was to graduate from North Vermilion this year.

Ramsie was killed in a head-on crash on Louisiana Highway 167 near Abbeville when a drunk driver, Brandon Isaac of Carencro, entered the divided highway driving in the wrong direction.

In her post, Ramsie's step-mom first talks about what it has been like for her and her family after losing Ramsie in the crash.

The elder Baumgardner talks about the sleepless nights and forgetful days, the feeling of being lost and being in a twilight zone, of sorts. She talks about how her family's world was shattered.

2 months of excruciating heartache. 2 months of sleepless nights & forgetful days. 2 months of trying to be strong while our other 2 daughters & our 2 sons take their turn either falling apart or totally shutting down. 2 months of mad panic every time the phone rings. 2 months of pushing thru the days feeling lost, like we’re walking around in a twilight zone. In a nutshell, it’s been 2 months since our entire world was shattered & completely turned upside down. - Kristi Baumgardner, via Facebook

Ramsie was killed when Isaac made the decision to drive after he had been drinking. Ramsie's parents, after rolling through what I am sure was a flood of different emotions, made the decision to forgive Isaac for his actions.

Baumgardner says that the decision to forgive Isaac came after realizing that being angry or having hate for him would not bring Ramsie back. Being angry or having hate would only compound the continued misery the parents are feeling.

I can not speak for everyone, but I can speak for Brian & I when I say that we have chosen to forgive. Most of you already knew that. That was our decision to make. NO ONE ELSE’s & we honestly aren’t interested in anyone’s opinion concerning it. Being angry would only add to the misery that we have to face daily & at the end of each day, the outcome of that night remains the same. - Kristi Baumgardner, via Facebook

The decision to forgive Isaac, I would think, took a huge burden off of Bryan and Kristi Baumgardner, and I commend them for looking at him as a man who made a mistake. A mistake that affected 2 families.

Baumgardner Family Baumgardner Family loading...

In the words of Kristi, he was ""a good person, a hard worker and a great father.""

Ramsie is still gone & another beautiful 6 year old is now without her father that she absolutely adored. He made a mistake. He was a good person, a hard worker and a great father. Two families are desperately trying to cope with their loss, not just one.

Baumgardner's post goes on to talk about the life we live here in south Louisiana, and how that lifestyle frequently revolves around alcohol and how many don't think twice about driving after drinking.

It’s also no secret that many have gotten behind the wheel after having those drinks. Happens all the time. Every single day someone does it. How many of you can stop reading for a second & think to yourself “well I’ve NEVER done that” and are actually being completely honest?

""Every single day someone does it.""

It's a lifestyle that needs to change, and Baumgardner knows that's not likely to happen. She is asking, though, for people to put more thought into having a few drinks.

ViewApart ViewApart loading...

If one can't limit the amount they drink, then they should have the foresight to make certain that they don't drive after they have been drinking.

I’m not delusional. Nothing we post or say is ever going to put an end to drinking & driving. That’s been a losing battle for years. But I will not stop trying to deter people & reminding them of the devastating consequences of one wrong decision.

Baumgardner's loss, her total devastation, comes out clearly in her words. So does her sincerity in asking others to not make the same mistake as Isaac. The decision to drink and drive not only has the potential to affect your life through fines/imprisonment/public humiliation/injury/death, but it also has the potential to affect dozens of other lives: the lives of anyone you injure or kill due to your selfishness. The lives of their families. The lives of their friends.

North-Vermilion-High-School1 loading...

The timing for Baumgardner's post is perfect, and that was intentional: it's North Vermilion's prom this weekend.

I chose this week to post because our school will celebrate their Junior/Senior prom this weekend as well as probably many other schools. Ramsie’s brother will go to his prom without her there. They were both supposed to be doing this together. We will attend with only one of our children there. That’s not how it was supposed be. This crushes us. There’s been enough loss, so please, let’s make it our mission to spare any other families from the same heartache.

Please: for your sake, for the sake of your family, and for the sake of anyone you may affect with your decisions, designate a driver. Get an Uber or Lyft. Stay put. Have someone hide your keys. Spare lives, heartache, and the futures of those around you.

Don't drink and drive.

Arkoosh, chairwoman of the Montgomery County commissioners, started holding daily briefings on Zoom virtual conferences in March 2020 just as Pennsylvania's first coronavirus outbreak occurred in her county. She made the difficult decision to put the county on lockdown, the first in the state.

Arkoosh is also a doctor. In those first briefings, watched by frightened Montgomery County residents, she stood alone at a podium with charts of climbing case counts next to her, pleading for the public to social distance and wear a mask.

Looking back, she describes the last two years ""as a very challenging time for me personally.""

But she says something that happened this past weekend gives her hope for the future.

""We have this wonderful theater in Norristown called the Theatre Horizon. We got to see our first show in two years there on Sunday,"" Arkoosh said. ""My husband and I both love to see shows. They require masks in the theater, which we are supportive of, and proof of vaccination. The show and the cast (of 'TJ Loves Sally 4 Ever') were terrific.""

It's been a long adjustment period dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, which on Friday turns two years old. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic.

The world has changed in all types of ways, from how we dine out to how we hug to where we work. Everyone is a bit of a novice epidemiologist these days, more familiar then we're probably comfortable with when it comes to germs. Who even uses the word, germ, anymore? We talk in terms of viruses and bacteria.

There is also the toll we can see with our eyes, whether it was talking to scared elderly relatives through a window at the nursing home or hearing that Central Park in New York City and the Liacouras Center at Temple University in Philadelphia were turned into makeshift, emergency hospitals.

Since March 2020, more than 79 million cases have been confirmed in the United States and most epidemiologists think it's likely there were many more unconfirmed cases. More than 960,000 Americans have died.

Drexel University epidemiologist Michael LeVasseur said in an interview Thursday that the number of infections is likely much greater than the confirmed cases, ""probably even by orders of magnitude.""

LaVasseur has been studying the coronavirus since March 2020. He was one of the first experts to talk with NBC10 about how the pandemic could play out.

Not everything we worried about in the first, frantic days of wiping down groceries turned out to be valid.

Still, other concerns like whether COVID-19 traveled by aerosol was found to be true, with dire consequences. In addition to our gained collective knowledge of infectious diseases, LeVasseur thinks the past two years have also provided the public with valuable insights into vaccines.

But medical experts still struggle with identifying traits of coronavirus variants, and how to convey knowledge of invisible viruses to the public.

""It’s been a constant game of understanding what our limitations of knowledge are as scientists and what the public expects,"" LeVasseur said Thursday.

As public health officials and virologists started to solve some of the medical riddles by the summer of 2020, the focus shifted to the mental health toll on workers, parents, children, nurses and others who beared a particularly heavy brunt of the pandemic.

Masking in schools turned into hundreds of legal battles across Pennsylvania and the rest of the country. Working from home indirectly led to what economists now call ""The Great Resignation.""

Americans' work-life balance was shaken up, and is being reimagined.

In a glass-half-full view of people's outlook, a poll released Thursday found that employees are happier with their work-life balance than before COVID struck.

Nearly seven in 10 people polled by Qualtrics, a business software management company, say they have grown closer to family members over the past two years. About 9 out of 10 people who have kids and have been working remotely, say their kids are happier when their parents are working from home.

The picture painted by the survey of workers' overall mental health is a bit cloudier.

The people polled who say they are better off is exactly the same as the people who say they are worse off than before the pandemic: 31%, according to the survey.

""It’s clear that the past two years have brought lasting change to work-life for American employees,“ head of employee experience advisory services at Qualtrics, Benjamin Granger, said. “As we enter a new phase of COVID, where measures like remote work and social distancing may become optional, it’s time for us to take stock of what we’ve learned so we can be intentional about what changes from the pandemic are worth keeping and which should be discarded. It’s critical that leaders don’t forget how flexibility and new ways of working have made life better for employees.”

It's also important not to forget what healthcare shortcomings were revealed by the pandemic, Arkoosh said.

That includes being better prepared for the next global health crisis and becoming more self-reliant as a country, she said.

""As I look forward, I hope to help solve some of the real challenges we experienced during the pandemic. I want to improve the public health infrastructure. We need new IT systems and improvements to modernize our public health departments,"" Arkoosh said. ""And we need to start making what we need in a emergency in this country.""

She think Montgomery County is ready to move forward into year three with confidence that the toughest part of the pandemic is behind us.

""It's nothing short of a miracle how effective these vaccines have been. It has allowed us to move away from the prevention of transmission to the prevention of serious infection,"" Arkoosh said. ""We’ve been able to shift the goals and the consequence of that is people can take the masks off. We know people are going to get minor cases. I had a minor case myself, thank God. Now, our focus is, 'Let’s prevent serious infections.' That’s how we move forward.""",Q1
https://theweek.com/tech/1009270/the-case-against-surveillance-advertising,The case against surveillance advertising,"Senate Democrats recently advanced a bill that would ban surveillance advertising — the core of the business model of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and several other tech companies. The Senate Judiciary Committee committee voted for the bill this week — and on a bipartisan basis, no less. In response, of course, armies of tech lobbyists are swarming Congress.

They shouldn't succeed in their aim to derail this legislation, which ought to be passed as soon as possible. Surveillance advertising is pointless, dystopian, and socially poisonous.

The scale of surveillance advertising alone is horrifying when you stop to think about it. Big Tech has created a pervasive, inescapable panopticon beyond the wildest dreams of the East German secret police. Virtually everyone's communication, friend networks, buying habits, and physical location are tracked in minute detail every minute of every day. The fact that the resulting information is usually only used to try to convince people to buy things is no comfort whatsoever — it's still incredibly creepy.

Tech apologists often argue that surveillance is fine because customers have (usually) consented to it by clicking a box at at the end of a 900-page end user license agreement. This is ridiculous. There's usually no way to use use tech hardware and services — much of it a near or absolute necessity for modern life, employment, and education — without mindlessly accepting the entire document.

No one reads or thinks about those terms because there's no real choice. Saying people have meaningfully ""consented"" to this is like Gilded Age oligarchs claiming workers ""consented"" to giving up their unionization rights with a yellow dog contract. If you ask people directly about the idea instead of burying it in a long, mandatory legal document, four in five say surveillance advertising should be banned.

Moreover, the mere existence of such a system is a violation of privacy and practically an engraved invitation to blackmail, including by the state. In the 1960s, when the FBI was attempting to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. into committing suicide, it took years and a ton of money and work to assemble a dossier of compromising personal information. (Incidentally, there was quite a lot of that — a reminder that even great moral exemplars often have unfortunate vices that are nevertheless no business of the cops or the public.) Now, far more extensive information is available to the FBI or CIA, which are arguably more lawless today than they were 70 years ago, at the click of a button. The same is true of innumerable employees at Big Tech firms as well as hackers who might gain access to their data systems.

It's true that behemoths like Google and Facebook make lots of money from surveillance advertising, and banning it would seriously disrupt their approach. But it's not as though they'd go out of business — they could still sell ads against traffic, and they'd still be the biggest players in a game where surveillance advertising would be banned for their competitors, too.

And anyway, it's not hard to see how making these companies less powerful and profitable would serve the public good. The rise of Google and Facebook came at the cost of tremendous damage to the journalism industry. As David Dayen points out at The American Prospect, news outlets used to sell themselves to advertisers with audience research — that is, general demographic information rather than personalized, individual dossiers. Giant tech platforms destroyed that business model and took most of the advertising money. As a result, publications of all sorts have been ruined, especially local news. Many small and even mid-sized cities have functionally no local politics coverage anymore, and that void in many cases has been filled by paranoid Facebook and Nextdoor groups.

Finally, it's not even clear whether targeted advertising is any better for businesses than the normal kind. These platforms have a lot of dazzling hype about the alleged ultra-accuracy of their Big Brother machine, but we've all been targeted with ads for things we'd never consider buying. (I constantly get car insurance ads despite having never owned a car in my life.) Or there's the ones that follow you around for weeks flogging something you already bought.

Both Google and Facebook have been caught repeatedly lying about their metrics, too. They allegedly conspired against advertisers to rig online ad markets, and one study found advertisers pay a large premium for targeted ads that are only 4 percent more effective than non-targeted ones. Where these ads are ""successful"" is even worse: The targeting function has enabled advertisers to discriminate illegally, showing housing and employement ads, for example, only to users in certain demographics.

Normal advertising, for all its problems, doesn't come with those risks. And it's not like it was hard to advertise when the only options were television, newspapers, radio, magazines, billboards, leaflets, non-targeted web ads, and word of mouth. Let's stop Big Tech from selling our details and enjoy some good old privacy again.",Q1
https://www.newser.com/story/315914/cops-mom-arrested-after-kicking-kids-out-during-storm.html,Cops: Mom Arrested After Kicking Kids Out During Storm,"An Ohio mom is facing child endangerment charges after being accused of kicking her two kids out during a snowstorm. Per WKBN , the alleged incident took place Monday, when police say they were called to the Warren home of 38-year-old Eva Harris just after 8am over a fight between the woman and her 17-year-old daughter. According to a police report, when the cops arrived, they could hear a fight taking place inside the residence, and when a perturbed Harris opened the door, she told police her daughter ""needed to go"" because she'd been disrespectful and poured a drink on her, per the Tribune Chronicle .

Police say the girl, clad in a thin jacket, emerged a few minutes later with a trash bag filled with her belongings, crying and wailing ""I have nowhere to go"" as she trudged through the 18 inches of snow on the ground. The temperature was said to be in the 20s at the time. Cops took the teen to the local police station but were soon summoned back to the house after a report that Harris had also kicked out her 16-year-old son. Police say they found him outside the home, also with a garbage bag full of his stuff. He told cops his mom had been upset with his sister over a boyfriend being at the house, and that he'd earned her ire for trying to stop them from arguing over it.

Police contacted Trumbull County Children Services then decided to arrest Harris after she wouldn't answer the door. She was finally taken into custody around 9:45am. Cops say there was another report on file with the agency about the family from September. According to jail records, Harris was released from custody later Monday on her own recognizance and arraigned Tuesday. She faces two counts of child endangerment, to which she pleaded not guilty. She's next due in court on March 1. (More weird crimes stories.)",Q1

AUSTIN, Texas — Texas will hold its 2022 primary elections March 1. Here are all of the candidates who have filed for the Democratic and Republican primary elections, according to the Secretary of State.

The video above is from related reporting.

Each party will choose its candidate for seven statewide seats — governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, land commissioner, agriculture commissioner, comptroller, and one of three seats on the Railroad Commission.

Republicans and Democrats will also choose their candidates to face off in November for district-based congressional and legislative offices, the State Board of Education, and judicial seats.

Texas has redrawn its political districts. Our map page shows which district your home is within.

Early voting begins Feb. 14. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the primary, the top two vote-getters will compete in a runoff on May 24. Texas is an open primary state, so voters can decide every two years whether to pick Republican or Democratic nominees (or hold out and go to third-party conventions).

Of note: Whatever primary you decide to vote in, you can vote only in that same party’s runoff. You can vote for either party's candidate in the general election.

Elections in Texas are run by 254 different counties, and each county determines the order of candidate names on ballots printed there. To see the ballot order for the primary in each county, visit the Texas Secretary of State’s site.

You can see the complete ballot list on The Texas Tribune website.

Governor

The governor is the chief executive of Texas. The seat has not been held by a Democrat since 1995, and Republican Greg Abbott is seeking a third term. His primary challengers include former state Sen. Don Huffines and former Texas GOP chairman Allen West. On the Democratic ticket, former El Paso congressman Beto O’Rourke has statewide name recognition after his 2018 U.S. Senate and 2020 presidential runs.

Lieutenant Governor

The lieutenant governor, the second-highest executive in the state, presides over the state Senate and heavily influences the state budget. Republican Dan Patrick is seeking a third term. Mike Collier is running against him and was the Democratic nominee in 2018.

See the complete list of candidates for statewide offices here.

Attorney General

The attorney general is the top lawyer in Texas, representing the state in mostly civil litigation. Ken Paxton is seeking a third term, and his tenure has been clouded by a high-profile securities fraud indictment and FBI investigation into claims of malfeasance in office. He has attracted three primary foes who are well known in Texas politics.

Land Commissioner

The land commissioner manages mineral rights for public lands in Texas and oversees the Alamo. The race is wide open as incumbent George P. Bush is running for attorney general.

Agriculture Commissioner

The agriculture department supports farmers, regulates fuel pumps, and administers school lunch programs. Sid Miller is seeking a third term.

Comptroller

The comptroller is the state official responsible for collecting taxes, overseeing the state treasury, and forecasting the amount of money that’s available for the state’s two-year budget. Republican Glenn Hegar is running for a third term.

U.S. House

Texas has a new 38-district congressional map that incorporates two new House seats the state gained due to population growth. U.S. representatives serve two-year terms, and 31 sitting members are running again. The state’s current delegation consists of 23 Republicans and 13 Democrats. The new map increases the number of districts that hypothetically would have voted for Donald Trump in 2020 from 22 to 25.

Railroad Commissioner

In Texas, the Railroad Commission regulates the oil and gas industry. Members of the three-person board are elected statewide. One seat is up for election in 2022.

Supreme Court of Texas

Three of the nine seats on the Supreme Court are up for election in 2022. Justices are elected statewide, and Republicans currently hold all the seats.

Texas Court Of Criminal Appeals

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is the state's highest criminal court. The nine members are elected statewide and are currently all Republican. Three seats are up for election this year.

State Board Of Education

There are 15 districts within the State Board of Education. Nine are held by Republicans, and six are held by Democrats.

Texas Senate

Every seat in the 31-member Texas Senate is up for election this year because the districts were redrawn by current legislators. Sixteen Republican incumbents were drawn into safe districts for reelection, and two additional Senate seats being vacated by Republicans would almost certainly go to new GOP candidates over Democrats next year based on the percentage of voters in the district who voted for Donald Trump over Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race. Senators serve four-year terms.

Texas House

There are 150 members of the Texas state House. Each state representative serves a two-year term. The election takes place under a new map drawn by current legislators which creates 85 districts that would have favored Trump in 2020 and 65 that would have voted for Biden. The current partisan breakdown of the House is 83 Republicans and 67 Democrats, though Trump won only 76 of the current districts in 2020.

Richard Acosta Jr., 33, was indicted on a capital murder of multiple persons charge by a Dallas County grand jury Thursday.

RELATED: Police charge man seen on video for Garland gas station murders

The shooting happened on the day after Christmas, when police said Acosta’s son, 14-year-old Abel Elias Acosta, opened fire in a Garland Texaco, killing three other teenagers and injuring one other person.

Authorities said Richard didn't pull the trigger, but he did help his son commit the murders.

He is accused of driving his son to the Texaco gas station, where police said the 14-year-old is seen on video firing multiple gunshots.

""In the video, it’s clear as day, Abel Acosta was the one to pull the trigger. The father was in the car and he is still charged with capital murder,"" Garland PD Lt. Pedro Barineau said. ""There are certain parts of investigations and involvements in cases, where even though someone may not have caused the injury or damage, they too can be charged with the exact same crime.""

RELATED: Shooting inside Garland convenience store leaves 3 dead, 1 injured

Police identified Richard by using surveillance video and he turned himself in after seeing his image on the news after the shooting, but Abel has been on the run since the shooting.

""We have not gotten any assistance from him. We have gotten nothing in leading to where Abel Acosta is,"" Barineau said.

A $10,000 reward has been offered for information on the teen, but police have not yet received any concrete leads into his whereabouts.

Investigators said they are regularly getting tips as to where the teenager may be, but none so far have resulted in finding him.

They don't even know if he's still in the country.

""He is 14, yes, which leads us to believe he is reliant on some people, but we can’t prove that,"" Barineau said. ""The fact that he is nowhere around and no one is coming forward leads us to believe someone is helping.""

While tips have not been fruitful yet, Barineau said detectives won’t stop until they get justice for the victims.

""They don’t rest well because, as police officer’s our job is to keep our community safe. So when there is someone we know is armed and dangerous, who has committed such a horrendous act, killing three people, wounding a fourth, shooting multiple times, they are still out there, that’s hard for us because we know that people can’t rest,"" he added.

BONDURANT, Iowa — More than a month after a woman was found dead outside of Courtyard Estates at Hawthorne Crossing, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office announced an employee at the facility has been charged with Dependent Adult Abuse – Intentional/Reckless Abuse.

Detectives said they charged 30-year-old Catherine Forkpa of Ankeny in relation to the death of Lynne Harriet Stewart after reviewing hours of video, conducting interviews and examining other evidence including phone records.

Forkpa intentionally committed abuse by neglecting her responsibilities at Courtyard Estates, according to a criminal compliant. On the night of Jan. 20 into Jan. 21, Forkpa allegedly was not carrying an iPad that sent notifications of alarms occurring within the memory care unit. Since she should have had the iPad, but did not, Forkpa could not respond to the alarms.

The complaint says Stewart was found on the ground outside around 6:10 a.m. on Jan. 21 ""with items frozen to her body."" The door that she was next to had been in alarm mode since 11:34 p.m. on Jan. 20.

Stewart had apparently been taking clothes out of her room during the night and putting the items by the door. She then went out through the door and couldn't get back in due to the security system locking it behind her.

""During this time the alarm was sending notifications to the iPad saying the door was still in alarm. While the alarm was still active the system was unable to send any other alarms until that first one was cleared for the Exterior Door,"" according to the complaint.

Stewart's door alarm was also activated around 4:30 p.m. on the 20th.

The complaint lists her cause of death as hypothermia and cardiac arrest, saying temperatures ranged from -3 degrees to -8 degrees that night.

The complaint also alleges Forkpa failed to walk down the east corridor of the facility to check on patients or alarms there throughout the night.",Q1

Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was a central figure in the Clinton administration, died at age 84, according to her family in a statement released Wednesday.

“We are heartbroken to announce that Dr. Madeleine K. Albright, the 64th U.S. Secretary of State ... passed away earlier today,” her family said. “The cause was cancer. She was surrounded by family and friends.”

Albright, who was secretary of state between 1997 and 2001 under then-President Bill Clinton, was a major champion of NATO’s expansion eastward into former Soviet countries as well as the NATO campaign in 1999 to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. She also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997.

“We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future, and we see the danger here to all of us,” she told NBC News in a 1998 interview. “I know that the American men and women in uniform are always prepared to sacrifice for freedom, democracy, and the American way of life.”

A day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Albright wrote that Moscow would be making a “historic error” by escalating the conflict, warning that the invasion would trigger “massive sanctions.”

“What is sure to be a bloody and catastrophic war will drain Russian resources and cost Russian lives—while creating an urgent incentive for Europe to slash its dangerous reliance on Russian energy ... That has already begun with Germany’s move to halt certification of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline,” she wrote for the New York Times.

And “such an act of aggression would almost certainly drive NATO to significantly reinforce its eastern flank and to consider permanently stationing forces in the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania,” Albright continued.

In June 2018, Albright, however, conceded that the Chinese regime is a larger threat to the United States than Russia.

“The new [National] Defense Strategy of the United States has now said that Russia and China are our major adversaries. I think that is a gift to [Russian President Vladimir Putin], because they are not the equivalent of China,” said Albright, “China is really a power that is evolving in a big way, penetrating various places. The Russians are not there.”

Early in the Clinton administration, she unsuccessfully advocated for a quicker, stronger response in Bosnia. But she backed a United Nations war crimes tribunal that eventually put the architects of that war, including Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leaders, in jail, James O'Brien, a senior adviser to Albright during the Bosnian war, told Reuters.

During efforts to press North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program, which were eventually unsuccessful, Albright traveled to Pyongyang in 2000 to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, becoming the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the secretive communist-run country.

EL PASO COUNTY, Colo. — During a hearing Friday afternoon, the defense for Letecia Stauch, who is charged with first-degree murder related to the 2020 death of her 11-year-old stepson Gannon Stauch, asked to change her plea to not guilty by reason of insanity.

Right after that, defense attorney Josh Tolini said they have an expert from out of state who recently agreed to assist and said that the expert believes there is a high likelihood of ""psychosis.""

He said they did not bring this up with the intent to delay the case, but said it was Stauch's best defense.

Prosecutors did not challenge the request but noted the decision not to challenge does mean they believe the claim.

>The video above is from September when a judge ruled there was enough evidence to go to trial.

Under Colorado law, the not guilty by reason of insanity plea must be entered at the time of arraignment but could be changed later if there is ""good cause,"" Judge Gregory Werner explained.

He ultimately ruled to allow the change of plea which resets the date for a ""speedy trial"" to occur. However, that timeline won't start until after the court receives the initial evaluation, Werner said.

Werner told Stauch as a result of the new plea, she could be given a polygraph during the evaluation and said any confession she makes will be admissible in court. He also explained that by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity she's waiving any confidentially of previous mental health records.

However, the defense filed a motion asking to waive a jury trial citing concerns over the massive amount of pre-trial publicity and the ability to find a fair jury pool.

The prosecution said they're not consenting to that at this time. District Attorney Michael Allen said he wanted to see the results of the evaluation first and said the motion was ""premature.""

Werner said he would not make a decision Friday and said he may not be able to rule on that until they get to jury selection.

Stauch's trial was set for March 28, but during Friday's hearing, both sides indicated they didn't believe they'd be ready to proceed at that time and Werner vacated that date. A new date was not set.

Stauch was already found competent to stand trial for murder after two separate mental health evaluations. Her next court date is set for March 17.

Stauch faces numerous charges in connection with the death of her stepson in January 2020. Gannon was reported missing from the Lorson Ranch neighborhood on Jan. 27, 2020, which is the day that prosecutors allege Stauch killed the boy in his bedroom.

Stauch was arrested in South Carolina on March 2, 2020. Gannon's remains were found later that same month in a suitcase near a Florida highway. They were found about six weeks after Stauch drove there in a Budget Rental van, according to prior court testimony.

Since her arrest, Stauch has been held without bond on felony charges. They include:

First-degree murder after deliberation

First-degree murder of a person under 12 by someone in a position of trust

Child abuse resulting in death

Tampering with a deceased human body

Tampering with physical evidence

Seven counts of a crime of violence for using a weapon (the weapons listed in the complaint include a firearm, blunt object and sharp object)

One count of crime of violence – causing severe bodily injury or death

She's also accused of slipping out of handcuffs and attacking a deputy as she was transported to Colorado from South Carolina following her arrest and plotting an escape from the El Paso County Jail. A separate criminal case is pending against her related to those incidents.",Q1
https://www.dawn.com/news/1667472/several-injured-as-rival-groups-clash-in-islamabads-islamic-university,Several injured as rival groups clash in Islamabad's Islamic University,"ISLAMABAD: Fear and panic gripped International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) after two groups of students clashed, leaving several students injured on Monday.

University officials said the clash erupted between students affiliated with Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba (IJT) and Pashtoon Council, which has support from students belonging to Gilgit-Baltistan, south Punjab, AJK and other areas.

The officials said that last month the two groups had also clashed at Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU).

Both the groups staged a protest demonstration at the IIUI on Monday. One of the groups held a rally at the main gate and on Kashmir Highway while a number of students belonging to the other group were camped outside the university’s administration block.

Pashtoon Council members claimed that students affiliated with Jamiat attacked their rally first. However, the IJT students denied this and said those involved in the murder of one of their colleagues at the university two years ago were still roaming freely.

IIUI Rector Dr Masoom Yasinzai said: “The Islamabad administration and police have brought the situation under control. Tomorrow, the university will remain open. Today’s unfortunate incident was fallout of a recent fight between IJT and Pashtoon Council at QAU.”

He said IIUI will not allow any student groups to promote its political agenda on the campus.

“We support the concept of student unions which should be meant for highlighting students’ issues and rights but these people are hooligans and they have nothing to do with student politics,” the rector added.

He added that the IIUI board of governors had already decided that the university will not recognise these groups.

The rector said the capital administration will take action against those involved in the incident.

“We are sharing CCTV footage with the police and the administration,” he said, adding the student disciplinary committee had also been asked to investigate the incident.

“We have around 30,000 students and out of them there are 30 hooligans, so we will not allow them to disturb the environment of the university,” he said.

Meanwhile, a press release issued by the police said heavy contingent rushed to the IIUI to control the situation, adding no one would be allowed to violate the law.

https://theintercept.com/2022/02/15/afghanistan-central-bank-911-lawsuit/,Biden’s Afghanistan Counsel Left the White House in January. Now He’s Poised to Reap Financial Windfall From Billions in Seized Afghan Assets.,"A lead attorney for some families of 9/11 victims who sued the Taliban — plaintiffs who could receive billions of dollars as a result of the Biden administration’s decision to seize the reserves of the Afghanistan central bank — also worked until January at the Biden White House on Afghanistan issues. Lee Wolosky, co-chair of the litigation department at the law firm Jenner & Block LLP, was appointed to help with Afghan evacuees in September 2021 and returned to his firm last month.

After the fall of Kabul, the U.S. government seized the assets of the country’s central bank, and last week the administration announced it would hold half of the roughly $7 billion for families who had brought suit against the Taliban, and deploy the other half at some undetermined point in time “for the benefit of the Afghan people.”

On Monday, Wolosky himself signed a brief asking the judges in the families’ case against the Taliban to move forward with enforcing the settlement. The long-running lawsuit stands to be a lucrative payday for the high-powered attorneys working on the once long-shot case. Lawyers often take a percentage of damages awarded, which in this case easily puts the payout into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Neither Jenner & Block nor Wiggins Childs Quinn & Pantazis LLC, two of the lead law firms representing the victims seeking compensation from the Afghanistan government, responded to a request for comment on the role of Wolosky or the firms’ fee structure for the decision. A representative of Wolosky referred questions to the White House.

In September, when Wolosky joined the administration, Axios reported he would be involved in resettlement of refugees “as well as other issues related to the U.S. drawdown from Afghanistan.” Wolosky was reportedly hired as a “special government employee,” a role that allows temporary appointments for up to 130 days in a year. Wolosky officially signed onto the 9/11 victims’ case on January 13, 2021, according to his filing with the court.

The White House said that Wolosky recused himself from discussions over whether the Afghan central bank reserves should be seized and handed over to him and his clients. “Lee Wolosky’s service as an SGE at the White House Counsel’s Office ended on January 6, 2022. Lee was formally recused from all matters related to Jenner & Block during his time as an SGE,” a White House spokesperson said. “Given his past representation of the victims of 9/11, he was specifically recused and walled off from any and all discussions related to any litigation related to the victims of 9/11, including but not limited to the disposition of the Afghan reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.”

Prior to his role at Jenner & Block, Wolosky was a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he also represented the families of 9/11 victims in an effort to seize funds from the Iranian central bank held in Luxembourg, arguing that Iran had aided Al Qaeda. Luxembourg ultimately ruled that the sovereign immunity of Iran took precedence over the plaintiff’s claim. Before that, Wolosky was appointed by former President Barack Obama to lead the ultimately failed effort to close the Guantánamo Bay prison.

The Afghanistan central bank was designed largely by the United States during the occupation and was modeled on the Federal Reserve. It remains in operation today, and two members of its board are Afghan American. By law, it is independent of the government and can’t be raided for pet government projects or to patch deficits. Its mandate is limited to price and currency stability. President Joe Biden’s use of the reserves to pay off a legal judgment for the clients of a recent senior administration official puts the administration’s criticism of the previous Afghan government as hopelessly corrupt in a new light.

The consequences of seizing the reserves of the central bank have been similar in Afghanistan to what would happen to the U.S. economy if the Federal Reserve was suddenly shut down. Businesses have been unable to secure loans, depositors have been unable to access money held in banks, importers have been unable to fund imports, the currency has collapsed, and prices have soared. More than a million refugees have fled starvation since the fall.

“The administration’s executive order on the frozen funds is tantamount to brazen theft and a death sentence for countless Afghans,” said Arash Azizzada, co-founder of Afghans for a Better Tomorrow, in a written statement. “It’s shortsight[ed], cruel and will serve to worsen the catastrophe currently unfolding in Afghanistan.”

“Taking money which rightfully belongs to the Afghan people,” he added, “will not bring justice but ensure more misery and death in Afghanistan.”",Q1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/iowa-tornado-victims-family-winterset,Iowa: four members of family killed as home razed by tornado,"Four of the seven people killed in devastating storms that tore through central Iowa on Saturday were members of the same family who sought shelter inside a home that was razed by a powerful tornado, authorities said.

Two children, their father and grandmother died when the tornado hit the grandmother’s home near Winterset on Saturday afternoon, the Madison county sheriff, Jason Barnes, told television station KCCI.

The children and their parents, from Blue Springs, Missouri, were visiting their grandmother, Melissa Bazley, 63. The storm killed Bazley, 37-year-old Michael Bolger and two of his three young children.

A GoFundMe page for the family said Kuri Bolger, the children’s mother and Bazley’s daughter, was seriously injured. Other family members who sought shelter in the home’s pantry were injured.

Two others killed in the tornado – Rodney Clark, 64, and Cecilia Lloyd, 72 – lived just down the street from Bazley in homes also hit by the tornado. The twister was rated an EF-3, with peak winds of 138mph, by the National Weather Service (NWS).

The seventh death on Saturday came from Lucas county, about 54 miles south-east of Des Moines, when a tornado struck less than an hour later, injuring several other people. The Iowa department of natural resources said the person who died was in an RV at a campground at Red Haw state park in Chariton, Iowa.

The storms were the deadliest in Iowa since May 2008, when a tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine in the northern city of Parkersburg. Another tornado a month later killed four boys at the Little Sioux Boy Scout ranch in western Iowa.

The storms on Saturday damaged or destroyed other homes and downed power lines and trees, causing some power outages. The tornadoes were followed by winter storms that dropped about 5in of snow in central Iowa and 6.5in in Mount Vernon in eastern Iowa.

The NWS said the storms generated an EF-1 tornado in south-eastern Wisconsin near Stoughton that included winds up to 80mph. The storm flattened trees, snapped power poles and blew out windows in homes. No injuries were reported.",Q1

Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernandez, detained pending a decision on his extradition to the United States on drug trafficking charges, will appear Wednesday before a judge in Tegucigalpa assigned to determine his fate.

Hernandez surrendered to police Tuesday, hours after the judge — whose name authorities are withholding for his own protection — issued a warrant for his arrest.

The former president is wanted in the United States over claims that he facilitated the trafficking of 500 tons of cocaine.

In power for eight years until three weeks ago, when leftist Xiomara Castro was sworn in as Honduras’s first woman president, Hernandez spent Tuesday night in the custody of the police special forces.

The 53-year-old rightwing politician, who served two successive terms clouded by corruption claims, was arrested hours earlier at his house in the capital Tegucigalpa by Honduran police in coordination with American agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration.

He offered no resistance, and allowed officers to cuff his hands and feet and fit him out in a bullet-proof vest.

Dozens of people with banners celebrated outside Hernandez’s home, while in other cities, people took to the streets with loudspeakers singing “Juancho goes to New York,” using his nickname.

The US embassy in Tegucigalpa said in a statement Hernandez is accused of trafficking some 500 tons of cocaine through Honduras, knowing it would end up in the United States.

– ‘Defend myself’ –

The ex-president faces three charges: conspiracy to import a controlled substance into the United States, using or carrying firearms including machine guns, and conspiracy to use or carry firearms in support of the conspiracy to traffic narcotics.

Hernandez is accused of having conspired with his brother, former Honduran congressman Tony Hernandez, who was in March 2021 given life in prison in the United States for drug trafficking.

Spokesman Melvin Duarte said Hernandez’s appearance Tuesday was to start the process for the judge to weigh information received from the United States.

Previous extradition requests had taken no more than four months to adjudicate, he added.

Hernandez vowed Tuesday to cooperate with domestic authorities, saying in an audio message on Twitter he was ready to appear in court and “defend myself.”

Though Hernandez had portrayed himself as an ally of the US war on drugs during his tenure, traffickers caught in the United States claimed to have paid bribes to the president’s inner circle.

Alleged associate Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez was sentenced in the United States last week to life in prison and a fine of $151.7 million for smuggling tons of cocaine into the country — with Hernandez’s aid, according to prosecutors.

In that trial, a prosecutor said the then-president had received millions of dollars from drug traffickers for protection — including from Mexican narco kingpin Joaquin “Chapo” Guzman.

Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that “according to multiple, credible media reports,” Hernandez “has engaged in significant corruption by committing or facilitating acts of corruption and narco-trafficking and using the proceeds of illicit activity to facilitate political campaigns.”

Hernandez denies the claims, which he said were part of a revenge plot by traffickers that his government had captured or extradited to the United States.

– ‘Bankrupt’ state –

His lawyer, Hermes Ramirez insisted Monday that his client enjoyed immunity from prosecution as a member of the Guatemala-based Central American Parliament, Parlacen.

Hernandez joined Parlacen hours after leaving office on January 27.

But some analysts told AFP the Parlacen charter gives members, in their country of origin, the same immunity they would have enjoyed as members of their own parliament, which in Honduras, does not exist.

They also said that any immunity conferred by Parlacen membership could be waived at the request of a national government.

During his term, Hernandez was accused of unjustly expanding presidential powers, including over the justice system and the country’s election tribunal.

His re-election in 2017 was met with widespread protests against an alleged fraudulent campaign in the poverty- and violence-ridden country.",Q1
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/covid-19-in-the-workplace-current-2354297/,COVID-19 in the Workplace: Current Trends and Legislation,"The COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant challenge in California. As of December 2021, California experienced the fastest increase in COVID-19 cases during the entire pandemic with 18.3 new cases per 100,000 people per day, and case rates increasing nine-fold within two months. At that time, the Delta variant was the most common variant causing those infections, but as of January 2022, the Omicron variant surpassed the Delta variant, accounting for more than 99.5 percent of new infections in the United States.

In response to the ongoing pandemic, laws and guidelines related to workplace safety continue to change rapidly. This article covers current California guidance on workplace masking, testing, quarantining, returning to work and supplemental sick pay as well as recent cases involving workplace rules and liability and California Senate Bill 606 which creates two new categories of employer occupational violations and puts employers at enhanced risk of incurring monetary fines.

Guidance on Masking, Testing, Quarantining, Returning to Work and Sick Pay

The COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards (ETS) are still in effect. In addition to these requirements, employers must follow public health orders on COVID-19.

Masking

On February 7, 2022, citing a decline in cases and hospitalization, the California Department of Public Health announced that the state’s near-universal indoor making requirement will end on February 15, 2022 for individuals who are fully vaccinated. Local areas may have their own indoor masking requirements, like San Francisco’s Health Order No. C19-07y, and many of these local orders are set to end or have their requirements reduced in coordination with the state guidance.

In workplaces, employers will still need to follow the ETS which mandates face coverings in a number of situations. Generally, employees do not need to wear a mask if they are fully vaccinated. Employers are required to provide unvaccinated employees with face coverings and ensure that they are worn indoors. Unvaccinated employees are permitted to remove their mask when they are alone in a room or while eating or drinking so long as they maintain six feet from others.

Testing

If there is an outbreak at work, employers need to make FDA-approved COVID tests available to exposed employees at no cost, during paid time, for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees exposed. Tests can no longer be self-administered and self-read, so workers cannot take a test at home by themselves.

Isolation/Quarantine and Returning to Work

If someone is exposed to COVID at work, state law requires that employers send the employee home, and maintain their usual pay until they meet the return to work criteria set forth by the California Department of Public Health. The CDC and the California Department of Public Health have shortened the isolation period to five-days for individuals who test COVID positive, regardless of vaccination status, if symptoms are not present or resolving, and if an antigen test collected on day five or later is negative. Otherwise, if the person does not test and symptoms resolve, isolation may end after Day 10.

Supplemental COVID Sick Pay Reinstated

On February 9, 2022, Governor. Newsom signed California State Bill 114 which allows up to 80 hours of COVID supplemental paid sick leave for employees at companies with more than 25 employees. The bill provides for two potential separate 40-hour periods of pay. The first being related to several situations where, for example, the employee, or a family member is subject to a quarantine or isolation period related to COVID, or the employee is ill and in the process of confirming a diagnosis. The second potential period applies when the employee tests positive or the employee’s family member for who the employee is providing care, tests positive. The bill creates Labor Code sections 248.6 and 248.7, and is retroactive to January 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022, taking effect on February 19, 2022.

The bill was negotiated after prior COVID specific sick pay had expired in September 2021, and is similar but not identical to the prior law. It provides new qualifying reasons for leave which include being advised to quarantine, caring for COVID-impacted family members, and attending a COVID-19 vaccination appointment. There is no direct tax or financial relief to employers who are largely responsible for bearing the burden of the cost, which the Legislative Analyst’s Office estimated as between $500 million and $1 billion.

Recent Cases Related to COVID-19 Workplace Safety

In January, the United States Supreme Court blocked an OSHA rule requiring employers with 100 or more workers to either vaccinate workers or test them weekly with the federal government footing the bill. The mandate, which has since been formally withdrawn, would have covered some 80 million private sector employees, and claimed that it would have saved over 6,500 lives and prevented over 250,000 hospitalizations in 6 months.

The Court’s majority found the mandate amounted to a “general public health measure” and not an occupational safety or health standard, and was beyond OSHA’s authority. The dissent argued that OSHA is responsible for responding to workplace health emergencies, and cited that COVID has killed nearly one million Americans, hospitalized around four million and is a “menace in work settings,” spreading where individuals have little control and little capacity to mitigate risk.

In December, the California Court of Appeal in See’s Candies, Inc., et. al., v Superior Court of California rejected an employer’s demurrer based on the “exclusive remedy defense.” According to the lawsuit, an employee alleged she contracted COVID at work due to her employer’s failure to implement adequate safety measures, including social distancing, and that after becoming infected, she stayed home where she infected her daughter and 72-year-old husband. Her husband died the following month.

The employer argued that the negligence and premises liability claims related to the husband’s death would not have occurred without the workplace exposure and were therefore barred by the exclusivity of the Workers Compensation Act as “collateral to or derivative of’ such an injury.” In rejecting this, the court said the defense does not preempt any injury causally linked to an employee injury, but that it remained yet undetermined whether the employer owed a duty of care to nonemployees infected as a result of workplace exposure.

Cal/OSHA’s Enhanced Enforcement Measures Under SB 606

Effective January 1, 2022, Senate Bill 606 extends the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health’s (Cal/OSHA’s) scope of enforcement, allowing OSHA to issue subpoenas and creating two new categories of violations: “enterprise-wide” violations and “egregious” violations with new penalties for workplace safety compliance. Proponents of the bill cited the need to hold large employers accountable for COVID related workplace hazards and protect essential workers from failures to provide personal protective equipment, access to paid sick leave and enforcement of adequate social distances guidelines.

Enterprise-wide Violations

Under SB 606, employers with more than one worksite will now face a rebuttable presumption that a violation at one location is actually “enterprise-wide” if either of the following are true: (1) the employer has a written policy or procedure that violates a safety or health standard; or (2) Cal/OSHA has evidence of a pattern or practice of the same violation or violations committed by that employer involving more than one of the employer’s worksites.

If the employer fails to rebut this presumption, Cal/OSHA is authorized to issue an enterprise-wide citation requiring enterprise-wide abatement. Enterprise-wide violations are subject to the same penalty provisions as “willful” or “repeat” violations. This means that such a violation puts the employer at risk of receiving a civil penalty of up to $124,709.

Egregious Violations

Cal/OSHA has also introduced “egregious violations” that can lead to exponential penalties for employers. If an inspection or investigation leads Cal/OSHA to conclude that an employer has “willfully and egregiously violated” a safety or health standard, then Cal/OSHA “shall issue a citation to that employer for each egregious violation.” Moreover, “each instance of an employee exposed to that violation shall be considered a separate violation for purposes of issuance of fines and penalties.”

The scope of what constitutes an “egregious violation” is broad and includes “persistently high rates” of injuries or illnesses, “an extensive history” of prior violations, or “a large number of violations” that “significantly undermine the effectiveness” of safety and health programs however the bill does not provide guidance on what the threshold would be.

What Does this Mean for Employers?

Employers should familiarize themselves with this guidance and new rules as soon as possible to mitigate potential exposure. Employers with multiple worksites should ensure that their written policies and procedures are up to date. Given the uncertainty over what constitutes an “egregious violation” employers should err on the side of caution when reviewing their policies and procedures for compliance with relevant safety and health standards. This may include offering additional health and safety training to personnel. Employers must also be prepared to respond to inquiries from Cal/OSHA, including requests for documentation, and carefully manage all Cal/OSHA inspections from start to finish.",Q1

Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson are set to begin Monday, and Republicans are already signaling their plan to attack her for providing legal representation to people imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay. In doing so, lawmakers are revealing a belief that certain people don’t deserve a quality legal defense — undermining a key pillar of the U.S. judicial system.

The GOP concedes that in her role as a Washington, D.C., public defender, Jackson did not choose her clients, but nonetheless accuses her of being too enthusiastic in their defense. “Jackson’s advocacy for these terrorists was ’zealous,’ going beyond just giving them a competent defense,” the Republican National Committee says on its website in a takedown of Jackson.

Advertisement

The implication is that Jackson should not have tried as hard at her job because of who she was representing: brown men from predominantly Muslim countries held without charge in an offshore detention facility. The D.C. bar’s rules of professional conduct explicitly instruct lawyers to represent their clients “zealously and diligently.” Even if every person held at Guantánamo Bay had committed acts of terrorism, they would be entitled to vigorous representation.

“That concept is fundamentally American, going back to John Adams’ representation of the British soldiers after the Boston Massacre,” said Alka Pradhan, a human rights lawyer who has represented several people imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay.

Perhaps aware of the flawed logic of attacking a public defender for capably representing her assigned clients, some Republican lawmakers are focusing their criticism on Jackson’s decision to continue her Guantánamo work after she left the public defender’s office and became a private attorney.

“She volunteered to continue that representation in private practice, which I think is interesting,” said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). “And frankly, from my point of view, a little concerning.”

(Hawley’s views on law and order appear somewhat muddled. He infamously saluted rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and recently began selling a coffee mug depicting that salute.)

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas.) told reporters that he was “curious” how Jackson ended up on Guantánamo cases and said “it might make a difference to me whether it was something she sought out.”

Lawyers often choose to represent people who have done horrible things in order to uphold a basic principle of due process, and to ensure that the government always adheres to it. Further, the idea that every person detained at Guantánamo Bay had done something wrong is patently false. Of the nearly 780 people detained there over the years, nearly all have been deemed safe to release, and very few have been charged with a crime.

In the spring of 2002, Maj. Gen. Michael Dunlavey, then the operational commander of Guantánamo Bay, traveled to Afghanistan to complain that too many “Mickey Mouse” detainees were being sent to the offshore prison. Even President George W. Bush knew that most of the Guantánamo detainees should not have been there, a senior Bush administration aide wrote in a 2010 court declaration.

By August 2002, it was apparent “that many of the prisoners detained at Guantánamo had been taken into custody without regard to whether they were truly enemy combatants, or in fact whether many of them were enemies at all,” wrote Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Colin Powell, in the 2010 court filing. Adding to the problem, Wilkerson wrote, was that many Guantánamo detainees ended up in U.S. custody after being turned over in exchange for bounties, sometimes as much as $5,000 per person.

“In numerous habeas corpus cases, we have proven over and over and over again that the U.S. paid bounties for detainees at Guantánamo Bay to partners in Pakistan,” Pradhan said. “Defense at Guantánamo Bay is not only necessary because everyone deserves a lawyer, but it underscores the fact that if we did not have representation of these people, a lot of these mistakes would not have been discovered, which fundamentally undermines the entire justice system.”

As a public defender, Jackson represented an Afghan national named Khi Ali Gul, who was detained without charge and confined to his cell for 23 hours a day. Gul has said that he actually fought with U.S. forces in Tora Bora, Afghanistan, and that he was wrongfully detained. He was freed from Guantánamo in 2014, after nearly 12 years of detention — and several years after an Obama administration task force determined him safe to release. There is no evidence that he has engaged in terrorism since. In a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire, Jackson listed Gul’s defense as one of the 10 most significant cases she has handled.

As a private lawyer, Jackson co-wrote two amicus briefs for Guantanamo cases. One, filed on behalf of the Cato Institute, the Constitution Project and the Rutherford Institute, argued that the U.S. government’s executive branch did not have the authority to indefinitely detain without charge people who were lawfully in the U.S. The second was filed on behalf of 20 former federal judges in support of the petitioners in Boumediene v.

Boumediene v. Bush “reaffirmed this concept of habeas corpus,” Pradhan said. “The idea that anyone — whether the Jan. 6 perpetrators or the Proud Boys and Black Americans who protest — would not be able to challenge the basis of their detention is contrary to U.S. history and U.S. values.”

NEW HANOVER COUNTY (WWAY) — Millions of dollars are heading to the Cape Fear to fight the opioid crisis after a massive settlement with drug makers.

This litigation against three major drug corporations ended with a $26 billion settlement toward opioid addiction prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and support services.

After battling drug addiction while pregnant, Hayley Vandegrift says she’s lucky to be alive.

After Vandegrift gave birth, she was one of the first to enroll in Wilmington Tides, a program that rehabilitates opioid addicted pregnant women.

“I was homeless and didn’t really have anywhere to go to stay sober and just had had this baby,” she said. “I didn’t even expect to you know, be in long term recovery. Never thought it was even possible, and I owe all of it to them. I don’t know where I would be without it.”

Vandegrift is one of millions battling opioid addiction. That number skyrocketed in North Carolina at the start of the pandemic. In New Hanover County, 41.4 residents for every 100,000 died of drug overdoses in 2020, according to North Carolina Health and Human Services. That’s almost 72 percent higher than the statewide rate. Drug overdoses and suicides also increased.

Coastal Horizons’ Kenny House says it’s more important than ever to treat those in need on the spot.

“With additives like fentanyl in both things like heroin and as well as into other drugs sold on the street, people are dying,” said House. “So instead of them resurfacing for treatment, more often we’re hearing about them passing away.”

Coastal Horizons treated between 250 and 300 patients at a time before the pandemic. Now, they’re treating closer to 650 for opioid addiction.

With $18.4 million of the $750 million opioid settlement coming to New Hanover County, Attorney General Josh Stein believes these funds could help turn the tide.

“There will be people alive next year who have a chance for a long, healthy happy life, who otherwise wouldn’t have made it it because of the lack of funding for important services that because of this, are going to be provided,” said Stein.

Since graduating the Wilmington Tides program, Vandegrift has kicked her addiction, fallen in love, begun raising a family and and found work helping women through the very program that helped her. She counts her blessings every day.

“I’m just glad that I got offered that second chance at being a mother and you know, a second chance at life really,” she said.

New Hanover County does not yet have an outline for how they plan to spend this money, which will be disbursed over the next 18 years. Stein says they’ll begin receiving those funds in April.",Q1

Special to the Daily Commercial

TAVARES — Jeremy Main, who reportedly called his wife at work and said, “You’re going to have a bad day,” goes on trial this week.

He's charged with killing their baby girl before that phone call to spite her for seeking a divorce.

Main told authorities, “I ruined my life,” but if prosecutors have their way, his life will be shortened by an executioner on death row.

'She was no longer with us'

Main’s wife, Holly Farrington, recalled in her deposition asking him why she was going to have a bad day on Oct. 9, 2017.

“And he went to telling me how he tried to kill himself. You know, he tried to kill himself like his dad, and that he’d tried to slit his wrists, but he was unsuccessful,"" Farrington said. ""But that he was successful in that he was going to give me my divorce, but that I wouldn’t have Makenzie, that she was no longer with us.”

Farrington called 911. Lake County sheriff’s deputies rushed to the home on Redbud Road in Lady Lake, kicked in the door, and were horrified by what they saw. The 17-month-old child, who was wearing a diaper, was floating face down in the bathtub.

“Throughout 20 years, you think you’ve seen the worst of the worst, then you see something like this, and you wonder what would take a person’s humanity to do something like that,” LCSO Lt. Fred Jones said at the time. “It’s hard on the detectives down there, hard on the crime scene investigators, the road patrol guys. We are all mothers and fathers, and it impacts us.”

Picking a jury

The nature of the crime will impact the jury pool, too. That’s why the clerk of court’s office sent out jury summons to 950 people.

By Tuesday afternoon, jury management had a workable list of 474 possible jurors.

It could take three or more days to select the 12-member jury and a few alternates. The trial could end up taking three weeks to complete. Fifth Circuit Judge James Baxley is presiding.

The state has listed four statutory death penalty aggravators, factors of the crime that lend themselves to a harsher sentence: the crime was especially heinous, atrocious and cruel; it was cold, calculated and premeditated, the victim was younger than 12; and she was especially vulnerable because Main was in a position of familial authority.

Among the potential jurors that will be dismissed are those who are morally opposed to the death penalty.

Assistant State Attorney Ryan Williams will be arguing for the ultimate punishment.

Main, who is now 43 years old, did not help his case.

He drove to a Sumter County Sheriff’s Office substation in The Villages and told two non-law enforcement officers at the front desk: “I killed my daughter and failed to kill myself.”

He later told a Lake County detective that he had made “a big mistake” and that he had “ruined” his life. He had superficial cuts on his wrists when he was handcuffed.

A look at the case

The state has also listed two jail-house informants among its witnesses.

John Spivey, executive assistant public defender, will argue that it is a case of aggravated manslaughter, or culpable negligence, and not first-degree murder.

Among his witnesses will be an engineer who concluded in his report, “It is biomechanically feasible that Makenzie Main climbed into the bathtub independently.”

Mental health experts have also been consulted.

Farrington’s statements have been gut-wrenching.

She said she never dreamed that there was a ticking time bomb behind the warm Facebook pictures, the little swing set in the back yard and neighbors seeing him pushing his daughter in a stroller.

She said she knew he was an “underachiever” when they married in July 2015, and soon learned that he was controlling and paranoid.

The weekend before Makenzie died, Farrington took her to Cocoa Beach.

She said Main told her: “You know, I can’t believe I messed up and lost the most important thing in the world.”

“You know, you really haven’t,” Farrington said she replied. “I shouldn’t be the most important thing in the world, you know. She should be.”

He replied: “You know, you really don’t know me, do you?”",Q1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/madeleine-albright-trumps-initial-reaction-coronavirus-huge/,Madeleine Albright: 'Trump's initial reaction to coronavirus was a huge mistake. I was appalled',"Albright’s bullishness in the face of petty and sometimes insufferable misogyny in office and beyond will make the reader laugh out loud. ‘And actually I had more problems with the men in our own government,’ she points out, ‘partially, I think, because they had known me too long. I had them to my house for dinner and passed their plates around. I had been a staffer and xeroxed and made a lot of coffee, so they must have thought, “How did she get to be Secretary of State?” That feeling was evident initially in the way that I was put down when I was a cabinet member and would be arguing for doing something in Bosnia. “Don’t be so emotional,” the men would say. And there were always ways of putting me down, but I learnt to argue in a way that didn’t get that reaction from them.’

If being among the highest-ranking women in the history of the US government wasn’t enough to quash the male sneers, nothing would. And when Albright was first asked to join the board of the New York Stock Exchange in 2003, she recalls overhearing a conversation between two male members, unaware she was on the other end of a conference call: ‘I am sure she can learn,’ said the first. ‘Yeah, right,’ replied the other. ‘And I can teach a monkey to play the piano.’

Any young woman t o day would be straight on to HR, if not an employment lawyer, I tell her. ‘Yes, but honestly I learnt to put aside things like that,’ she says without even a trace of residual anger. ‘Sometimes you do have to call men out on something, but it depends on how irritating it is. For me it was always more about trying to get the agenda through, and not caring so much about how I was being treated.’ Albright’s words remind me of those of St Paul’s Girls’ School’s former headmistress Clarissa Farr, who caused an outcry last year when she urged girls to see sexism in the workplace as an ‘attractive challenge’ rather than waste too much time complaining and developing a ‘hostile attitude’ towards men. ‘I agree with that,’ says Albright. ‘There are so many things that can be done to rectify a situation, and I do think it’s counterproductive to be permanently angry about something. Far better to sort out the problem – solve it.’

It’s apparent in Hell and Other Destinations how much its author enjoys the company of men. ‘I have a lot of male friends,’ she tells me when I ask whether her power made it hard to have close personal relationships with men after her divorce. She tells me about a group she created with her former colleagues, called the Aspen Ministers Forum. ‘Its unofficial name is “Madeleine and her exes”,’ and she assures me that she has remained a very sociable person. ‘I did love what I was doing though, so I have never felt a loss in that regard.’

It would be all of our loss, she insists, however, if we stoke the division between the sexes. ‘And I really do think that there is this division between us. But we can’t all be the same. We’re different. And I’m fascinated by why men are afraid of us. I do think we’re very hard working and caring and good at multitasking, but I am convinced that the world works better when we work together. And I don’t think we can blame it all on men.’",Q1

But have you heard of Kashirsky and Kashirsky?

In a FOX 32 Special Report, we introduce you to a pair of west suburban streaming super sleuths.

Scott Peterson to Drew Peterson — those are just a few of the cases Mark Kashirsky and his wife Jamie re-examined with their podcast listeners, offering them a perspective few get to see.

Mark is a retired south suburban police detective and Jamie is a paramedic.

Ten months ago, they decided to combine their unique careers and launch a podcast that takes their listeners inside the investigations in to not only well known cold cases, but some that have been solved too.

""That’s my goal. I want to find stuff that people have not heard before,"" Jamie said.

When she’s not at her regular job or taking care of their two kids, Jamie spends what little spare time she has researching the next case they are going to profile on their podcast.

""I don’t sleep. He’s laughing because he wakes up at 2 in the morning and is like, ‘seriously go to bed,’"" Jamie said.

In the roughly 45 weeks they have been on the air, they have produced 40 episodes. Many of them are at the requests of listeners.

""The first two we did, we did local. Because we knew them. We had ties to them,"" Jamie said.

Those two cases were Drew Peterson and Jaclyn Dowaliby.

In 1988, a 7-year-old girl was taken from her Midlothian home in the middle of the night. Her body was found just days later in Blue Island.

After reading through dozens of documents in the Peterson case, Jamie says she learned this about Stacy Peterson’s disappearance.

""He took and parked her car at Clow Airport and she called him – supposedly, according to him – she called him and said she left her car at the airport and he needed to go pick it up,"" Jamie said.

And with the Dowaliby case, it was a chance to tell people about an investigation they might not know about from a very unique perspective.

""My father was the agent assigned to the case. So when we did that podcast, we had a lot of inside information from my father,"" Mark said.

They hope to help police solve a case one day. For Mark, he'd like it to be the Dowaliby case — while Jamie would like it to be the Delphi murders out of Indiana.

In the meantime, their podcast is helping the community in other ways.

""I just received not too long ago another subject who believes his nephew was murdered and is asking for help on the case,"" Mark said.

Before that, a woman from Alabama contacted them about her sister's death.

""I helped her with the medical records and stuff and he’s helped her with FOIA’s, who to talk to, what to say and how to get information from the district attorney,"" Jamie said.

Even though the podcast is called ""Death Do Us Part,"" it seems to have a rejuvenating aspect to it.

""I liked the idea,"" Mark said. ""Plus, it made me feel like I was still doing the job.""

Mark retired not that long ago from the Riverdale Police Department, following complications from back surgery. So now it’s this podcast and listeners from across the country that keep him on his toes.

Mark and Jamie's ""Death Do Us Part"" podcast is available on most streaming platforms.

https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/2022/01/10/human-trafficking-documentary-produced-mary-baldwin-senior/9156291002/,Human trafficking: Mary Baldwin senior provides education on issue through new documentary,"STAUNTON — Kaitlyn Savage wants to bring awareness to what she believes is a major problem in the United States and around the world — human trafficking.

According to the Organization for World Peace, while statistics vary, by some estimates there are up to 300,000 individuals trafficked each year in the United States.

The Mary Baldwin University senior and graduate of Staunton High School applied for and won a $1,000 grant to use for a research project of her choice. Savage knew she wanted to do a documentary to help bring awareness to the issue of human trafficking.

This past summer she worked for a Freedom 4/24, a nonprofit organization based in Lynchburg and focused on that very issue.

According to the organization’s website, human trafficking is a “form of modern day slavery involving the commercial exploitation of vulnerable women, men and children through force, coercion or deception.” The organization said that while human trafficking includes all forced labor, a vast majority of victims are sold for sex.

Savage wanted to find out why Virginia hasn’t passed effective anti-trafficking legislation. She said the state is behind many others in this area.

“My hypothesis was that there’s a lack of education amongst legislators that deters them from being proactive in the anti-trafficking war,” said Savage, an international affairs and political science major.

She interviewed 14 individuals, including current members of Virginia’s House of Delegates. She used her interviews to write her senior thesis and then the recorded interviews that she had done on Zoom to create a documentary for her honors thesis. The documentary is titled “Unveiling Human Trafficking: A Call to Action"" and is available to view on YouTube.

“There’s a lot of misconceptions,” she said. “It’s not the kidnapping version, it’s not like the movie ‘Taken.' It’s relationships and grooming tactics.”

Savage said many times the grooming begins through social media when an older person compliments a photo of a minor. That makes the minor feel good that someone is paying attention to them and the two begin a conversation.

Patrick McKenna with the Virginia Coalition Against Human Trafficking told Savage for her documentary that it's mostly an exploitation of some vulnerability. Maybe a minor posts on social media that they had a fight with their parents. Or they don't feel attractive enough. Or maybe they post a video of them singing.

The trafficker come along and tells the minor that he understands what it's like to fight with parents or that she's beautiful or they have a great singing voice.

""That vulnerability ... that need or that desire that somebody uses for their purposes in order to somehow profit for themselves,"" McKenna said.

Sometimes it feels like a romantic relationship for the minor, but is simply a tactic for the trafficker to make a connection.

The legislators she spoke with, even if they didn’t have a firm understanding of the issue, were willing to listen and learn, Savage said.

“We just need to education people,” Savage said. “That’s the purpose of the documentary. I just want a lot of people to watch it.”

Karrie Delaney, who represents Virginia's 67th District in the House of Delegate, told Savage that a lot of people don't realize human trafficking happens in the United States.

""They think about something happening in other countries, in developing nations,"" she said.

One of the people Savage spoke with is former delegate Chris Saxman. He told Savage that a lot of times bills on this topic don’t gain traction simply because of politics. The growing divide between the two political parties means they just won’t cooperate even if the subject isn’t inherently a political one. That surprised Savage, and it’s a topic she wants to explore further.

Savage said one word that kept coming up in her interviews was “community.” There’s a need for law enforcement officers, educators, attorneys and legislators to all work together. Getting all groups on the same page is an important part of getting and enforcing effective legislation.

She said Virginia was the last state to pass legislation defining sex trafficking. Virginia also doesn’t have safe harbor laws preventing minors from being prosecuted for prostitution. Often the victims are criminalized for things they were forced to do.

What Savage found through her research is that Virginia is lacking in these areas of law simply because of a lack of education as well as a belief by some that it’s just not a problem in Virginia.

“It’s easier if it’s out of sight, out of mind,” said Savage, who hopes her documentary will help bring light to the subject.

“The more people are aware,” she said, “the more people can prevent it.”

The year 2022 appears to have favoured the political fortunes of the ruling DMK , which saw the third generation politician in the M Karunanidhi family - Udhayanidhi Stalin - getting elevated as a state minister while the political fortunes of the opposition AIADMK was in retrograde marked by gross mudslinging, opportunism and disunity. The once back-bencher of Tamil Nadu politics - the BJP - emerged as a significant player hogging the limelight. The saffron party emerged as a vociferous critic of the DMK, donning the role of the principal opposition party much to the indignant AIADMK, which crossed all limits for a rapprochement among the warring factions.The October 23 Coimbatore car explosion in a communally sensitive area in the city, which witnessed deadly serial blasts in 1998 coinciding with BJP veteran LK Advani's visit, created a scare before the state government handed over the probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).At least four personalities- K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam - both former Chief Ministers - and expelled V K Sasikala and her nephew T T V Dhinarakan-, projected themselves as leaders carrying on the legacy of AIADMK founder, the late chief minister M G Ramachandran and late J Jayalalithaa.But in reality, post Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and Dhinakaran have become insignificant to the dominant faction of the AIADMK led by its interim general secretary Palaniswami, for whom Panneerselvam too joins the troika with the two expelled leaders.The die is cast for the dynamic political environment in the state to culminate to a poll mode at the year-end. A strong socialist character has been the soul of politics in Tamil Nadu where the BJP is going the extra mile by whipping up nationalism. Freebies, sugar coated as welfare measures, have been the hallmark of politics in Tamil Nadu.Political rhetoric often indulged in by the DMK has helped the BJP to gain ground leaving the AIADMK to harp only on the DMK's unfulfilled poll assurances.With his party confronted with a crucial ideological battle against the ruling DMK, and a disunited AIADMK frantically engrossed in leadership tussle as ally, BJP Tamil Nadu chief K Annamalai hopes to cruise through politically turbulent waters to ensure the lotus blooms in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.He has set the goals high for the party members, mandating them to perform or give way to talented persons, who may be newcomers.His analogy of accommodating new passengers if some passengers get off the bus, is seen as a warning to the party members to perform or give way to others. ""It is very crucial for the party cadres to sustain the momentum built by Annamalai who has made the BJP a strong force in the state,"" says BJP state vice-president M Chakravarthy.The Lok Sabha elections and also the 2026 Assembly polls will turn out to be a straight contest between the BJP and the DMK, he claims.Stalin, who piloted the DMK combine to win 38 out of 39 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 election, and also stormed to power in the state in 2021 Assembly polls, after being in the opposition for a decade, has set his eyes on winning all the 39 seats and in addition the lone Puducherry seat.He is gearing up for the poll with the catchphrase: Narpathum namathe, naadum namathe, meaning ""all 40 seats and state should belong to us.""Despite several challenges like NEET waiver and new education policy, Stalin rose to become a tall leader in Tamil Nadu politics, and has succeeded in keeping his DMK and the alliance intact.A disunited AIADMK is likely to make it a cakewalk for the DMK to post a spectacular win at the hustings. A divided AIADMK may embarrass the BJP, which may think of going solo in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections to test its electoral strength.Palaniswami has closed all avenues for rapprochement with Panneerselvam, whom he accused of rendering the AIADMK dysfunctional.""Without the Two Leaves symbol, the AIADMK is nothing and it would not be in a position to take on the ruling DMK in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,"" says Dhinakaran, general secretary of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).Not only the party cadres but also the public would solidly back the leader retaining this symbol, he claimed.The year also saw actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan join the Bharat Jodo Yatra of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, apparently hoping to improve his position among key political players in TN.The State hogged the national headlines for the wrong reason due to the Coimbatore car explosion in October. The case was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The state reported about 45,000 cyber crime cases till November 2022 displaying an increasing trend in cyber crimes.Tamil Nadu reported 1,368 murders till October and this is 15 per cent less than the murders reported during the corresponding period last year. Among the murders, the alleged killing of a college student at St Thomas Mount Railway Station, who was pushed in front of the train allegedly by her stalker, shook the state.The Arignar Anna Zoological Park (AAZP) at Vandalur , has been rated ""very good"" in terms of Management Effectiveness Evaluation for Indian Zoos for 2022.The state government won appreciation from various quarters for conducting the 44th Chess Olympiad at Mamallapuram in July-August.The Idol Wing unit of the police cracked several cases and traced the stolen idols to international auction houses.A trial court in Kumbakonam convicted international antique dealer Subhash Chandra Kapoor and five of his accomplices to 10 years imprisonment in the Udayarpalayam burglary and illegal export of 19 antique idols valued over Rs 94 crore to the Art of the Past Gallery, New York, USA.The Special Court Judge also imposed penalty on all the six accused - Subash Chandra Kapoor, Sanjivi Asokan, Marichamy, Packiya Kumar, Sri Ram alias Ulagu and Parthiban under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy).Kapoor, a US national, was arraigned as the first accused for his alleged involvement in burgling and illegally exporting 19 antique idols totally valued above Rs 94 crore to the Art of the Past Gallery, owned by him.Though coronavirus continued to circulate, people took the pandemic lightly giving a miss to face masks.

Brookings, S.D. — For their efforts in creating the state’s first 4-H Legislature, the South Dakota 4-H Legislature Program committee received the Citizenship in 4-H Youth Development Award at the 2021 National Association of Extension 4-H Youth Development Professionals conference held in Memphis, Tennessee.

The NAE4-HYDP is the professional organization for those dedicated to promoting, strengthening, enhancing and advocating for the 4-H youth development profession.

“Sometimes we get stuck in the mindset that good ideas only come from other places,” said Tim Tanner, South Dakota 4-H program director. “This team wasn’t afraid to challenge themselves and our 4-H program to try something new.”

Committee members include Caroline Hansen, 4-H Youth Program Advisor in Davison and Hanson counties; Jenae Hansen, 4-H Volunteer Development Field Specialist; Hilary Risner, Program Manager and Regional 4-H Youth Program Advisor; and Amber Erickson, former 4-H Field Operations Coordinator.

Risner and Hansen attended the NAE4-HYDP conference to accept the award, network with other 4-H youth development professionals and attend sessions facilitated by colleagues from around the country. In addition, the pair presented on the South Dakota 4-H Legislature Program during the Global Civic Engagement Luncheon hosted by the NAE4-HYDP Civic Engagement Working Group.

After identifying a need to provide more civic education opportunities for South Dakota youth, committee members launched the South Dakota 4-H Legislature to help 4-H members gain a better understanding of how state government operates. Created in 2020, the program mirrors many aspects of how the South Dakota legislative branch functions, and it enables members to learn how they can impact laws and policies in the state, while serving as a voice for strengthening the South Dakota 4-H program.

“Our county 4-H programs are funded by county commissions, their city parks are created by city councils, and their everyday school day is affected by the local school board,” said Caroline Hansen. “Understanding why and how those individuals got into those roles and understanding the importance of all those levels can help them have a more-comprehensive understanding of civics in the country.”

4-H members can get involved in the program by serving as a candidate/legislator or as a constituent. Legislative candidates include senior age division 4-H members interested in becoming directly involved in the program’s leadership opportunities. All enrolled South Dakota 4-H members serve as constituents for the program and can engage in the process by signing petitions, voting for candidates, voicing their concerns to their elected legislators and observing the legislative process.

While running for office, candidates collect petition signatures and run a campaign. Once elected, legislators participate in a series of webinars to learn more about the legislative process before they begin writing bills for the mock legislative session. During the legislative session, legislators present their bills in committee meetings, hear proponent and opponent testimony on each, and vote whether to send the bill to the house floor, where the bill will be discussed and voted on, much like how bills make their way through the South Dakota Legislature. The session, held on the floor of the South Dakota House of Representatives, also provides 4-H members with the opportunity to sit in the same seats as state lawmakers.

Because bill topics are about 4-H, legislators’ ideas, bills and resolutions have shaped some of the statewide and local 4-H initiatives.

In its first year, 318 4-H members voted for 24 elected legislators. Jenae Hansen notes how the program has evolved over the past two years.

“We’ve seen our 4-H legislators express interest in running for office as adults, take interest in serving as pages with the South Dakota legislature and take additional interest in shadowing South Dakota legislators during session,” said Jenae Hansen. “These are opportunities they may not have had or known about without the program.”

“To see their creativity and hard work payoff is rewarding,” said Tanner. “Our entire 4-H team celebrates them in this well-deserved national recognition!”

Scholz is always perfectly prepared, people say, sometimes in awe, sometimes in annoyance. And that was true this time as well. Ahead of his trip to Kyiv and Moscow, the chancellor spent days speaking with Russia experts both in Germany and abroad. He spoke with Merkel at length and worked his way through Putin biographies and the 2015 Minsk Agreement.

Confidants say that Scholz is usually a step ahead. He can be patient for extended periods, allowing others to drone on and on. And then, once everyone else is exhausted, he’ll unexpectedly pull out a new proposal. Scholz has been negotiating his entire career. And he is self-confident enough to believe that he could find success on the international stage as well. In the most important European negotiating duo, Scholz’s role is that of the cool-headed pragmatist, while Macron prefers to draw up grand schemes. They complement each other well in that regard. Whereas the Americans and British sketch out horrific, worst-case scenarios, the Germans and the French search for concrete solutions.

NATO and the East

The dispute over NATO’s influence in Eastern Europe is hardly a new one, with the alliance’s last major eastward expansion coming 18 years ago. Why Russia has decided now to call for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Eastern Europe – including Poland, Romania and the Baltic States – cannot be explained by any recent development.

The possible entry of the former Soviet states of Ukraine and Georgia was negotiated at a NATO summit in Bucharest back in spring 2008. Then U.S. President George W. Bush was pushing for the expansion, while France and Germany expressed strong reservations. Merkel, the German chancellor at the time, believed it would be a big mistake to promise those nations future NATO membership. The negotiations ended with a compromise: NATO accession was established as a possibility for the two countries, but a ""Membership Action Plan"" as demanded by Bush was not pursued. Still, it was enough to anger Russian leadership, and since then, Moscow’s relationship to the Western military alliance has been seriously strained.

It is surely no coincidence that Russia has embroiled those two states – Georgia and Ukraine – in border conflicts that make their entry into NATO unlikely in the long term. And at the same time, Ukraine has oriented itself ever more strongly toward the West and the EU since the Russian annexation of Crimea and since the Moscow-backed war in the Donbas. The support in Ukraine for the country’s entry into NATO and the EU has never been so high.

Ukraine is slipping further and further away from Russia, quite independently of the question of NATO accession. There is much to suggest that this is the reason for Russia’s threatening moves in recent weeks. Putin’s goal is likely that of regaining political influence in Ukraine.",Q1

LAS VEGAS (KVVU) — There has been a rise in homicides throughout the valley, and the increase is impacting families and funeral home directors.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police released the number of murders reported in 2021. The Homicide Investigations unit reported 147 murders — an increase of 44% since 2020.

At 20 years old, Courtney Hemphill is one of, if not the youngest, licensed funeral arrangers in the state of Nevada. Hemphill works for Giddens Memorial Chapel. He said they noticed it was a very violent summer.

“Fourth of July weekend between the third and the fourth, we saw several young people about my age that came through our doors and having to sit across the table from their families with my young self sitting there it’s something that I will never forget that experience just sitting there and having to oversee their services,” Hemphill said.

Before Metro’s murder stats were out, Hemphill said funeral directors at Giddens Memorial Chapel saw a need to create change.

In November, the Funeral Directors and Morticians Association of Nevada held a hearse procession and community march called Stop the Violence. Seven different funeral homes participated and around 150 showed up.

“Taking the power back is the best way that I can explain it you know a lot of these families were left broken in shambles after this and left with the questions and there were questions to us and I’ve had people ask me how do I go on? How do I move forward?,” Hemphill said.

They wanted to rally behind the families and let them know they’re fighting the cause to increase peace with them.

”The most terrifying sound that I’ve ever heard was of a grieving parent,” Hemphill said.

According to Metro’s murder 2021 stats, the majority of killings involved gunshots.

“It adds that tragic factor into it that’s when you deal with the extra heartbreak, that’s when you deal with the extra emotions the anger that comes with that because sometimes- and we don’t ever take it personal but I’ve been on the receiving end of that anger and grief makes people do and say some pretty crazy things,” Hemphill said.

A huge increase in gun sales in 2020 seems to be a contributing factor into the recent rise in homicides.

The state’s Point of Contact Firearms Program processes background checks. They released the amount processed from 2019. There was a big jump from 2019 to 2020, but a decline in 2021.

Calendar year 2019: total transfers processed: 102,096

Calendar year 2020 total transfers processed: 185,629

Calendar year 2021 total transfers processed: 139,815

https://www.idsnews.com/article/2022/02/sunrise-bloomington-holds-rally-to-pressure-iu-foundation-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels,Sunrise Bloomington holds rally to pressure IU Foundation to divest from fossil fuels,"Sunrise Bloomington, a local climate action organization, held a protest Tuesday to call on the IU Foundation to divest from fossil fuel companies.

Divestment is defined as disclosing current investments in the fossil fuel industry, removing those investments, and reinvesting that money into companies that encourage sustainability and protection of the environment, according to a petition created by Sunrise Bloomington.

The event took place on the lawn of the Harlos House, where the IU Foundation often meets on campus.

Around 140 students, both from IU and local high schools, attended the rally, as well as faculty, staff and other members of the Bloomington community, Sunrise Bloomington member Sanjana Agarwal said.

Demonstrators carried signs that had phrases such as “IU CO2 burns your future” and “Where is IU’s climate action plan?”

“We are tired of the IU Foundation refusing to discuss divestment with us,” member Joleena Mundy said.

In the fall 2021 semester, the IU Foundation pulled out of a planned meeting with Sunrise to discuss divestment, according to IndyStar.

The rally came just one day before representatives from IU Student Government, Sunrise Bloomington and Students for a New Green World were scheduled to meet with IU President Pamela Whitten about IU’s plans to address climate change.

“IU is letting its students down by not having a solid climate action plan,” said IU senior Abbey Krulik. “We would like to have a future on this planet.”

Many other schools in the Big Ten conference have already made commitments to stop climate change, including Illinois, Nebraska and Michigan.

“Divestment is an important step in addressing the fundamental, unavoidable climate change challenges that the IU Foundation must face,” said Isak Nti Asare, Democratic Candidate for Indiana’s 9th District.

A group of students from Bloomington High School South walked out of their classes to join the rally.

“We are tired of hearing that nothing can be done, we don’t buy it,” Bloomington South student Alex Kutza said.

There have been calls for IU to divest from fossil fuel companies, dating back to at least 2015 with the group Reinvest IU.

“They failed to meet these demands and have still made investment choices that jeopardize our future, we won’t stand for it,” Kutza said.",Q1

https://bearingarms.com/tomknighton/2022/02/22/baldwin-fired-n55704,Rust DA believes it's possible Baldwin fired accidentally,"Actor Alec Baldwin has been under fire for a little while now, ever since the fatal shooting of a young cinematographer on the set of the movie Rust.

Baldwin has maintained that he never pulled the trigger on the gun when it “just went off” as so many people claim their’s did.

However, the New Mexico DA looking into the case thinks the actor may be right.

Meanwhile, Santa Fe’s district attorney, Mary Carmack-Altwies — who has worked as a public defender and later in a private capacity — spoke with Vanity Fair and told the publication that in her estimation following an “unofficial test” from her team, it is possible for a live round to be discharged from a firearm without the trigger being pulled. Carmack-Altwies has yet to file criminal charges, and a full forensic report is expected in late-February, which many anticipate will speak to the make and type of ammunition that was used in the prop weapon, which was supposed to be housing blank dummy rounds. … “One of the investigators in my office happens to have a very old type revolver, and so he brought it, at my request, so that we could look at it and see if that was at all possible,” she told the outlet, adding that the room was cleared and two independent inspectors looked over the weapon — one who supplied the piece and another who verified it was empty. “Then they visually showed me you can pull the hammer back without actually pulling the trigger and without actually locking it,” Carmack-Altwies explained. “So you pull it back partway, it doesn’t lock, and then if you let it go, the firing pin can hit the primer of the bullet.” Meanwhile, in December, Sheriff Adan Mendoza told Fox News Digital,”Guns don’t just go off. So whatever needs to happen to manipulate the firearm, he did that, and it was in his hands.”

So which is it?

Well, both Mendoza and Carmack-Altwies are correct as far as it goes.

This “unofficial” test doesn’t actually tell us anything that we didn’t already know. Yes, some older models of guns had no safety features to prevent that kind of thing from happening. We’ve long known this.

However, you can’t pick up a random “older” gun and conduct a test with it and it tell you anything about the gun Baldwin had in his hand at that exact moment. After all, it’s unlikely it was an antique firearm being used on that set. It’s far more likely it was a newer model that looked like the older guns but has the relevant safety features.

And why is Carmack-Altwies and her office conducting tests on different guns than the one used to killed Halyna Hutchinson? Don’t they have some degree of access to the actual weapon in question? If so, why not test that one to see if it could happen, rather than some random gun someone in the office has?

If not, why not?

As for Sheriff Mendoza arguing that guns don’t just go off, he’s not wrong. Even if it’s just a case of the hammer slipping out of someone’s finger, it’s still a case of someone manipulating the gun. It didn’t just go off.

It would also seem to me that if this is a case of Baldwin just playing with the gun and the hammer slipping out of his fingers, that’s still manslaughter. He’s been in too many movies where he handled guns to have never been told that you don’t just fidget with a gun. If he did and it went off and someone died as a result of that negligence, that’s not much different than a cop grabbing her handgun rather than her taser, at least in my opinion.

Of course, I’m not a prosecutor, and Carmack-Altwies and her test have me concerned that Hutchinson won’t get the justice she deserves because the supposed prosecutor isn’t really doing her job and using half-assed experiments with completely different guns to justify not prosecuting a big movie star.

I hope I’m wrong on that, but this latest news doesn’t fill me with confidence.",Q1
https://www.dawn.com/news/1673407/three-terrorists-killed-in-kech-during-operation-against-panjgur-attackers,Three terrorists killed in Kech during operation against Panjgur attackers,"QUETTA: Three terrorists, including two high-value targets, were killed on Friday in an operation carried out by security forces in Kech district of Balochistan to hunt down those involved in late Wednesday night attacks on their two camps in Nushki and Panjgur.

Levies personnel along with security forces also launched a search operation in the Roghani area after a grenade attack on a check-post in the border town of Chaman left two Levies Force personnel and four civilians injured.

The ambush came as a grim reminder of the last week attack claimed by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in which a soldier of Levies Force was martyred.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) in a statement issued late Friday evening explained that security forces conducted a follow-up operation in the Balgatar area of Kech and surrounded a makeshift hideout of the terrorists linked with the recent terrorist activities in Panjgur.

In the intelligence-based operation, security forces encircled a trench being used as hideout by terrorists and in an ensuing exchange of fire killed all the three terrorists later identified as Summair alias Bahar and Altaf alias Lalik besides the terrorist commander, Phailan Baloch, who was involved in attacks on security forces in Hoshab, Panjgur and other areas.

According to the military’s media wing, they were involved in terrorist activities across Balochistan. Also, a “cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from the hideout,” the ISPR stated.

Giles, 34, is on trial in the Sept. 8, 2018, death of her estranged husband, 30-year-old Thomas Coutee Jr. She faces charges of second-degree murder and obstruction of justice.

The last person to testify before lunch Tuesday was Andrew Bergeron, a special agent and investigator with the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation within the Louisiana Attorney General's Office, which is prosecuting the case.

Louisiana Assistant Attorney General Joseph LeBeau presented Bergeron with multiple documents related to the divorce and custody battle between Giles and Coutee. When LeBeau tried to have Bergeron read a specific part of the first document, the matrimonial agreement, George Higgins III, Giles' attorney, objected.

Higgins told 9th Judicial District Judge Greg Beard that he wanted jurors to read the document for themselves, so copies of all the documents introduced during Bergeron's testimony were given to the jurors.

Higgins did not object to any of the documents being entered as evidence.

Trial Day 2 morning coverage:Kayla Giles' 2nd-degree murder trial continues with crime scene testimony

Gun was purchased, protective order box wasn't checked

LeBeau asked Bergeron if there were any attachments on the joint custody order, and he said there were two protective orders — one with Coutee as the petitioner, the other with Giles as the petitioner.

The state also introduced the motion for a new trial in the custody case that Coutee filed, a notice of service to Giles dated on Sept. 7, 2018, and a federal firearms transaction form that showed Giles had bought the Ruger LCP .380 pistol used to kill Coutee in Dallas 12 days before the shooting.

LeBeau asked Bergeron if there was a section on the federal form that asked potential buyers if they were the subject of a protective order. He said there was, but it was not checked.

Bergeron also testified that a National Instant Criminal Background (NICS) check was not done on the Ruger sale. Giles was given an exemption because she had a valid permit in Texas.

Trial Day 1 coverage:State says Kayla Giles is 'cold, calculating,' but defense says she was protecting herself

She and Coutee lived in Waco, Texas, before moving to Alexandria.

LeBeau asked Bergeron if Giles could have bought the gun if a NICS check had been done. He replied no.

At that point, both sides conferred with Beard. Then LeBeau asked Bergeron if he was affiliated with the Alexandria Police Department. He said no.

After another discussion with Beard, a lunch recess was called. After the jury left the courtroom, Higgins said he needed time to do some research. Beard told both sides to be back in court 15 minutes before the jury.

Giles' attorney said it was proof she committed federal crime

When everyone returned, Higgins asked for a mistrial.

He contended that whether the state could introduce the evidence that Giles had not checked the box regarding protective orders on the federal form was information that should have been the subject of a hearing before trial.

What Bergeron had done, and what the jury had read, was evidence that Giles had committed a federal crime, he said.

LeBeau disagreed, saying the phrase ""lied on the form"" had never been spoken. He said what Giles did was an integral part of the homicide, arguing that if she hadn't bought the gun that Coutee never would have been shot.

""This act shows specific intent,"" he said. ""Judge, quite simply, no gun, no murder.""

He also pointed out that Higgins did not object to the introduction of the evidence.

Higgins argued again that, while telling jurors about the gun purchase was OK, the protective order information was not.

Beard spent about an hour considering the arguments and researching case law before returning. In denying the motion, he agreed with the state that the act was so connected to the offense that it did not need to be argued in a separate hearing.

A ripple of relief could be heard from Coutee's family and friends in four rows in the gallery.

Jurors hear recorded fight between Giles, Coutee

Jurors came back into court at 3 p.m., and Higgins briefly cross examined Bergeron.

The next person to testify was lead Detective William Butler. With him on the stand, the state played the surveillance videos from Walmart and Sonic. Both videos captured the pair arriving for the child swap, but neither showed a close-up view of the shooting.

After the lengthy videos, LeBeau asked Butler if he helped search Giles' home with crime scene investigator Chris Fonville, who spent most of Tuesday morning testifying.

And he asked about a Sony voice recorder that had been entered into evidence earlier in the day.

Butler said the recorder was found at the Oakdale home of Giles' sister. She consented to a search of her home without a warrant, he testified.

Initial coverage:Wife served court order before deadly Louisiana Walmart shooting

The only recording played on Tuesday was from an unknown date when Giles turned over their daughter to Coutee. The two spoke about the girl when he arrived, but it soon devolved into a profanity-filled argument about who provided better care for her, the court case between them and the men Coutee alleged Giles was bringing around the child.

As Coutee left, Giles called to him and told him he did not want to mess around with one man she referred to by name.

Giles can be heard laughing as she left, saying, ""Thomas is playing with fire, and I recorded it all.""

Court was recessed for the day after that, and Butler will be on the stand again Wednesday morning.",Q1

Davis and the Bridgeway Foundation are credited with playing a pivotal role in mobilizing awareness, civilian protection and recovery efforts against a notorious Ugandan warlord and his rebel army that terrorized civilians across Central and East Africa in a decades-long campaign of brutality.

Joseph Kony and the Lord’s Resistance Army were responsible for killing more than 100,000 people, displacing millions, and abducting tens of thousands of children to become soldiers, laborers and sex slaves.

Kony, who is still a fugitive , was indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2005 on 12 counts of crimes against humanity and 21 counts of war crimes. Only one of the five LRA members charged by the ICC is in custody.

How did Davis and her coalition achieve success where others had failed? What inspired her to step outside the bounds of her traditional work to help undercut Kony’s power?

What did the experience teach Davis about the meaning of justice and role of humanitarianism? How has she incorporated those lessons into her work since?

What does it mean to be a “global citizen” in 2022? How can we be better global citizens and humanitarians here in San Antonio?

The World Affairs Council of San Antonio named Davis its International Citizen of the Year for 2022 and will celebrate her March 2 at an award dinner to support the council’s mission to promote public understanding of world affairs and enhance San Antonio’s participation in a global community.

https://news.yahoo.com/missouri-lawmaker-seeks-prohibit-residents-201454274.html,Missouri lawmaker seeks to prohibit residents from obtaining abortions out of state,"The pattern emerges whenever a Republican-led state imposes new restrictions on abortion: People seeking the procedure cross state lines to find treatment in places with less-restrictive laws.

Now, a prominent antiabortion lawmaker in Missouri, where thousands of residents have traveled to next-door Illinois to receive abortions since Missouri passed one of the country's strictest abortion laws in 2019, believes she has found a solution.

An unusual new provision, introduced by Republican state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, would allow private citizens to sue anyone who helps a Missouri resident obtain an abortion out of state, using the novel legal strategy behind the restrictive Texas law that has banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy since September.

Coleman has attached the measure as an amendment to several abortion-related bills that have made it through committee and are waiting to be heard on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Abortion rights advocates say the measure is unconstitutional because it would effectively allow states to enact laws beyond their jurisdictions, but the Republican-led Missouri legislature has been supportive of creative approaches to antiabortion legislation in the past. The measure could signal a new strategy by the antiabortion movement to extend its influence beyond the conservative states poised to tighten restrictions if the Supreme Court moves this summer to overturn its landmark precedent protecting abortion rights.

""If your neighboring state doesn't have pro-life protections, it minimizes the ability to protect the unborn in your state,"" said Coleman, who said she's been trying to figure out how to crack down on out-of-state abortions since Planned Parenthood opened an abortion clinic on the Illinois-Missouri border in 2019.

A Supreme Court decision that undercuts Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion across the United States, probably would create a national landscape that encourages patients to cross state lines for abortions, with Democrat-led states moving to protect abortion rights as Republican-led states further limit them.

The trend has been apparent in Texas, where the majority of people seeking abortions since the state's six-week abortion ban took effect in September have been able to obtain the procedure at clinics in neighboring states, or by ordering abortion pills in the mail, according to a report from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. Demand for abortions has skyrocketed in Oklahoma, Louisiana, New Mexico and other nearby states. Planned Parenthood clinics in states that border Texas reported that patient traffic increased by nearly 800%, and independent providers reported comparable increases.

Since Planned Parenthood opened its clinic on the Missouri-Illinois border in October 2019, 10,644 Missouri residents have received abortion care at the clinic, according to Planned Parenthood. By early 2021, the last remaining clinic in Missouri was typically providing between 10 and 20 abortions per month, according to preliminary data from the Missouri Department of Health.

Coleman said she hopes her amendment will thwart efforts by Missourians to cross state lines for abortions. The measure would target anyone even tangentially involved in an abortion performed on a Missouri resident, including the hotline staffers who make the appointments, the marketing representatives who advertise out-of-state clinics, and the Illinois and Kansas-based doctors who handle the procedure. Her amendment also would make it illegal to manufacture, transport, possess or distribute abortion pills in Missouri.

Olivia Cappello, the press officer for state media campaigns at Planned Parenthood, called the idea ""wild"" and ""bonkers."" She called the proposal ""the most extraordinary provision we have ever seen.""

If enacted, the measure almost certainly would face a swift legal challenge.

Elizabeth Myers, an attorney for Texas abortion rights groups in a court challenge to the six-week abortion ban, said states cannot regulate activities beyond their borders. She drew a parallel to marijuana laws, which also vary from state to state: While Texas lawmakers can outlaw marijuana, and punish anyone who uses the drug within Texas borders, she said, they have no jurisdiction over a Texas resident who uses marijuana in a state where its use is legal.

""A state's power is over its own citizens and its own geographical boundaries,"" Myers said. ""These are limits imposed by the federal constitution and federal law.""

Coleman's proposal still may succeed in deterring out-of-state abortions, said Myers. Like the Texas law, the proposal itself could have a chilling effect, where doctors in surrounding states stop performing abortions before courts have an opportunity to intervene, worried that they may face a flurry of lawsuits if they violate the law.

Coleman rejects arguments that her law is unconstitutional.

""That's what they said about the Texas law, and every bill passed to protect the unborn for the last 49 years,"" she said.

Coleman prayed outside the clinic on the Illinois-Missouri border on the day it opened, she said. Since then, she said, she's been talking to ""anyone who would listen"" about legal strategies for decreasing the number of Missouri women who seek abortions in other states.

While Coleman says she has been happy to see the sharp decline in abortions in Missouri, she said she can't fully celebrate the success when so many women are obtaining the same procedure a few miles away.

""It's just tragic,"" she said of the number of Missouri residents who get abortions in Illinois. ""It feels very sad and heavy.""

Abortion clinics in states that support abortion rights are preparing for a surge of new patients if Roe is overturned. They are opening new locations and advocating for legislation that would allow them to accommodate more people. Lawmakers in several states have proposed bills this session that would allow nurse practitioners and nurse midwives to perform abortions, in addition to physicians, while others are planning to create statewide databases that will allow out-of-state patients to more easily plan their abortion care.

""We've got already half of states that have passed some kind of law to restrict or eliminate abortion access,"" said California state Sen. Nancy Skinner, a Democrat who has introduced legislation to help make California a ""sanctuary state"" for people seeking abortion access. ""We definitely are and intend to be a national beacon for reproductive freedom and reproductive justice.""

https://petapixel.com/2022/01/30/photographer-captures-the-brutality-of-the-ms-13-gang-in-el-salvador/,Photographer Captures the Brutality of the MS-13 Gang in El Salvador,"Tariq Zaidi is a British photographer who has spent three years between 2018 and 2020 studying and documenting the savagely violent gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and others operating in El Salvador.



Prior to becoming a photographer , Zaidi lived in Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina, working in event management or teaching for around four years and traveling across almost all of North, Central, and South America.

“When then-President Trump was calling Central American migrant caravans ‘criminals’ and the like, I wanted to explore what kind of life these people were leaving behind…” Zaidi tells PetaPixel. “I wanted to show the world just how dystopian El Salvador has become and how the extent, scale, and savagery of violence is unlike anything most of us have ever known.”

Giving Up a Cushy Job for the Passion of Photography

In 2014, Zaidi gave up an executive management position in an events business to pursue his passion for photography — of capturing the dignity, strength, and soul of people within their own environment. Since then, he has worked in 21 countries across four continents, mainly in the developing world.

In 2018, the British photographer visited El Salvador for the first time and started the project, but only after eight months of gaining the trust of local contacts through emails and phone calls. In that initial experience, he documented mainly wakes, funeral parlors, and prisons. He went back in 2019 and then finally in 2020 when he managed to get greater access to crime scenes and police work to round out his project.

The photographer focused on El Salvador because it had the highest murder rate of any country not in a war zone in 13 of the 22 years between 1995 and 2017. The murder rate spiked in 2015 and 2016 at 103 homicides per 100,000 residents, well above the second and third highest countries, Venezuela and Honduras (which had 90 and 57, respectively).

Spanish Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado named the country after Jesus Christ, literally “The Savior” in Spanish in the 16th century, but today the gangs have made life a living hell for the inhabitants.

Becoming the Eyes of the World in a Hostile Place

Zaidi was invited by Paul (name changed), the mayor of a small municipality outside of San Salvador, to see what he was doing to protect his community against the gangs.

“We got into the car and cruised around doing security checks, speaking to people about whether they’ve had any problems with gangs,” recalls the photographer. “He then got a call from another car saying that they had detected gang activity and to get ready for action. It was pitch black, and we were speeding down mountain roads around 2 a.m. in the morning. The other guys in the car wore balaclavas and had guns.

“Paul gave a gun to my fixer and tried again to get me to take a revolver. He said, ‘If we get in a firefight, they’ll rape the female journalist in the car and chop off her arms and legs before they get to you. Put down your camera and take this gun’.”

Zaidi wants his imagery to show how much the gangs control day-to-day life in this Central American country bordered by Honduras, and Guatemala. The extent, scale, and brutal violence are impossible for an outsider to imagine. It may even be dangerous to cross certain streets as a different gang may control the other side. When a driver enters a new neighborhood, he may have to flash his lights and roll down his windows to offer allegiance to the gang, lest he becomes a target of attacks.

Zaidi had to work hard with numerous authorities to gain photography privileges to prisons, police centers, and murder sites. He liaised with government officials, the police force, STO (Tactical Operational Section), and emergency services to join night raids and be one of the first to arrive on murder sites. He usually worked alone or with a fixer.

There were many challenges in making contact with victims and their families. The police would block access to photojournalists at murder sites, so the best alternative was to trawl WhatsApp and Twitter to reach crime scenes before the police did.

Often, Zaidi waited outside morgues to meet those who were grieving, like Suzy (name changed), who had just identified the body of her 25-year-old son Brian (name changed). She told me her son had been strangled by members of Barrio 18, a rival gang of MS-1, for not fulfilling the missions they had asked of him. The mother was understandably distraught, and the photographer talked for a while and stayed in touch. A few days later, she invited him to the wake.

When the documentary photographer talks to families who have experienced this violence—murders, disappearances, extortion, death threats—he understands that most people live out their days in fear. He wishes to amplify the voices of those Salvadorans who fight for fundamental human rights, security, and safer life for their children and families.

Coming Face-to-Face with MS-13

“I think it is important for the viewer of the book to see and perhaps even ‘feel’ the presence of a gang member up close and personal,” says Zaidi. “The portraits put a face to the story and the violence that is unlike anything most of us have ever known.

“The only way to meet them ‘safely’ is in prison. Even though, according to the former Minister of Justice and Security, Rogelio Rivas, incarcerated gang leaders are responsible for ordering 80 percent of all attacks in the country.”

Zaidi, who speaks Spanish, worked with a fully staffed admin team on the ground in El Salvador who helped get him access. He asked the various government ministries to grant permission to visit all possible gang-related (men and women) prisons in the country but was given access to only six.

“In 2018, after eight months of repeated requests and meetings, I was granted access to 6 gang prisons,” he says. “In 2019 and again in 2020, permission for prison visits was denied.”

Photographing inside prisons was important as that is the primary place to talk to and photograph gang members. Because of the way gangs work, it is impossible to contact them outside. These images inside prisons also show how President Nayib Bukele is dealing with gangs by boarding off cells or mixing gang members.

“When visiting Penal Center of Quezaltepeque, I was shown the ‘nicer’ parts of the prison only,” says Zaidi. “I knew there were special sections in the prison – high security and under the ‘extraordinary measures’ scheme which I wanted to see.

“Eventually, after a long discussion with the prison director and staff, I was granted 3 minutes in this area of the prison. The main reason given to me was that it was for my own security as there had been some murders inside the prison around the time I was visiting.

“3 minutes is not a lot of time, but I managed to make a few images showing this part of the prison and the conditions in which the prisoners were living.”

Publishing the Project as a Photo Book

Most of the images were made using a Sony a7 III mirrorless camera with a Sony 24-105mm lens. The electronic shutter has helped the photographer operate quietly and without drawing attention. He finds flash too intrusive and does not like the look/feel of flash unless used in a studio-type environment. He also does not use tripods.

Zaidi captured around 70,000 files between stills and videos in the three-year project and almost entirely in RAW. He keeps multiple hard drives on location to keep the images safe as there is not enough Internet bandwidth to upload to the cloud.

After he showed images from his first trip to photo editors from news agencies, they thought the work was strong and suggested that he keep working on the project. It was not till his third and final year that he was quietly confident a book should be made from this work.

The most challenging and most time-consuming part of the process has been the editing down of the 70,000 images to the final 100 to 200 photos that have been considered for the book. The book publisher did the post-processing and color management.

“I feel a tremendous and heavy responsibility with this work, for the people I worked with, my local team, the people I interviewed and photographed, and their families,” says Zaidi. “I worked very closely with the publisher in terms of balancing which images should go in the book – vs. which could go in but may create security issues with the person in the image or for their family.

“All images that we deemed to have any security concerns were not used in the book, even if they could have visually enhanced the work. Names and personal details have also been purposely omitted from the book to protect the person and their families. It was also essential to show gang members but without glorifying them in any way.”

The project was published in November 2021 as Sin Salida (“No Way Out”) by GOST Books.

Zaidi hopes to return to El Salvador and make a short video documentary to accompany the book and future exhibitions to provide a more holistic learning and viewing experience for those interested in understanding these issues in the country and Central America broadly.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2340123/substance-abuse-drug-rehabilitation-programmes-missing-despite-rise-of-addiction,Drug rehabilitation programmes missing despite rise of addiction,"The chronic disease that is drug addiction, like other diseases, can be managed and treated but the stigma and unawareness attached to it in the country has resulted in an inconcrete governmental effort to combat it.

For instance, as per official police department sources, currently, there are roughly 15,000 people fighting drug addiction in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P)’s capital Peshawar alone, but the rehabilitation centers for drug addicts in the province have a capacity to treat only 2,000 people.

According to the statistics of the provincial government, 11 centers are functioning in K-P - located in Peshawar, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Lower Dir, Malakand, Swat, Charsadda, Dera, and Kirk. None, however, exist in the tribal districts of Khyber, Mohmand, Bajaur, Orakzai, North and South Waziristan, and Kurram. As a result, the residents of these areas knock on the doors of the center in the provincial capital for treatment. Their worries do not end with a trip to Peshawar though, as according to the provincial Social Welfare Department, these individuals are either turned away or put on a waiting list due to lack of space.

The other option to fall back on, which many cannot rely on, is to spend millions of rupees at private centers. If they are lucky they end up securing a place at non-governmental organization (NGO) operated rehabilitation centers which albeit cheaper are still unaffordable and like other centers have marginal treatment efficacy rates. According to Aizaz-ud-Din, the Monitoring Officer of a NGO working on rehabilitation of drug addicts in Peshawar, the rate of complete recovery from drugs is only 32%.

One such case out of the countless in K-P of a lack of success with rehab is, Baisat, a resident of Chamkani, a suburb of Peshawar, who has been addicted to drugs for the last eight years.

“I have been treated three times but I cannot give up my addiction,” he said. Baisat, who recently did a three month stint in jail on charges of theft, has two children, but his family refuses to spend any further money on his treatment.

Aizaz-ud-Din’s center charges Rs600 per patient per day which includes food, medicine, counseling, and detoxification but is still out of the price range of many like Baisat’s family. Aizaz-ud-Din conceded that most of the patients like Baisat, who have already been treated, eventually come back.

Juvenile and female drug addicts

Unsuccessful attempts at rehab aside, K-P has a brewing drug-addicted juvenile problem at hand as well. According to an NGO report, the number of such children between 2010 and 2018, stood at more than 5,000 in Peshawar alone and has only risen ever since. As per sources, about 500 to 600 children contact rehabilitation centers annually, with ages ranging from 12 to 18 years and are mostly garbage and scrap collectors and beggars.

Similarly, the rate of addiction amongst women has risen ten-fold in the province but as per sources, only about 2% of women contact for treatment in private clinics or rehabilitation centers.

The problem is exacerbated due to the lack of a juvenile or women rehabilitation center by the government.

The Express Tribune found that due to the lack of centers, the provincial Social Welfare Department has no concrete data on the number of young and female substance abuse addicts. Ayesha Bano, a Member of the Provincial Assembly and Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education who also works for women’s rights in K-P, told The Express Tribune that a meeting had recently taken place with the Social Welfare Department in which the establishment of a center for women and juveniles was discussed in detail.

“Consultations are also underway with the department regarding separate arrangements for women in government centers in the province, efforts will also be made to set up a state-of-the-art rehab center for the juveniles in the province,” she informed The Express Tribune.

Patiala, January 31

Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) chief Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday set the ball rolling for his party’s electoral debut with an aggressive call to party workers to take on the mantle to save the state’s future from nefarious interests, while accusing the Congress of fighting these Assembly elections on his government’s achievements of four and a half years.

Addressing PLC workers after filing his nomination papers from Patiala Urban, the former chief minister trashed Charanjit Channi’s tall claims of delivering on the Congress promises in 111 days, pointing out that everything that he was claiming as his personal achievement “was accomplished by my government, including creation of jobs, action social welfare schemes, free bus travel for women and farmers’ debt waiver”.

Even in the sacrilege and drugs cases, in which he was accused of failing to take action as a pretext to remove him from chief ministership, it was his government that had initiated strong steps to take matters head on, pointed out Capt Amarinder.

His government, he noted, had fought hard, right up to the Supreme Court, to get the sacrilege cases back from the CBI, leading to 19 officers, including ex-DGP Sumedh Saini, being booked.

As for the drugs cases, the PLC leader declared that it was his government that successfully broke the backbone of the drugs mafia, leading to the arrest of more than 40,000, including many big fish.

But it would be naïve to believe that drugs can be completely wiped out anywhere in the world, and more so in a border state like Punjab where Pakistan was pushing in drugs almost every day, he added.

Pointing to the unequivocal support he had extended to the farmers during their agitation, the former chief minister said despite blockades at 137 places across the state, his government had taken no action as he was cognisant of the concerns of the farmers.

Lauding the eventual revocation of the farm laws, he noted that never had it happened before that the prime minister of a country hadapologised for any policy decision, as was done by Modi while withdrawing the legislations.

Promising to change the face of Punjab with the support of the government at the Centre, led by PLC ally – the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the former chief minister said with the Narendra Modi government set to remain at the Centre for at least another seven years, PLC could transform the state with their support if voted to power.

“Punjab’s economy is in a bad shape, it is reeling under huge debt, and needs financial support from the Centre,” he stressed, adding that the future of the state’s students, youth, farmers and others was at stake and need close Centre-state coordination to save.

Inaugurating his party office in Patiala, Capt Amarinder said, as in the past, he was leaving the fight for this seat to the workers here, while he would go into battle for PLC and its allies in other parts of the state.",Q1

On January 7, she received a PR box from Ben Affleck’s recent film, which hit select theaters on December 17. She shared its contents with her followers on Instagram Stories, revealing cans of Blue Point beer in addition to a miniature bowling set. “This is adorable from The Tender Bar,” Lopez said. “Oh, a little note to me on what the movie’s based on, all this stuff from the movie in here. Cute.”

She explained the relevance behind the bowling set from the film. “There’s a great scene in a bowling alley with Ben and the little boy [Daniel Ranieri],” Lopez added while opening the gift. “Ben plays his uncle, [and] they’re both amazing in the movie. If you haven’t seen it, you should. This is awesome. Thank you, Tender Bar.”

Directed by George Clooney, The Tender Bar is an adaptation of novelist J.R. Moehringer's memoir recounting his life in Long Island. In the film, Affleck stars as Uncle Charlie, the unconventional father figure of JR Maguire (Daniel Ranieri/Tye Sheridan) who shows him around his world of bartending.

In a December interview with Vanity Fair, the actor opened up about the ways he relates to his character. “There were a lot of similarities for me personally with this movie,” Affleck told the magazine. “My dad worked at a couple of bars … so I spent a lot of time being close to my dad at the bars.”

He continued, “I understand and kind of have a sense for the title of the memoir, and the movie is meant to be a little bit paradoxical at first blush. Like, how could there be this impactful, warm, nurturing environment at a bar? But I had a sense of that as a kid, and I totally connected with that, especially with my dad, in that safe space. There was a world of people there. It had a community there with people to talk to and who supported you.”

Affleck looked traditional beside her in a black overcoat, suit vest, trousers, and white shirt, paired with a long black tie.

J.Lo has been an avid supporter of Affleck on his recent projects, having joined him for other red-carpet events including one for Affleck’s other recent film, The Last Duel, at the Venice Film Festival in September. The two have been going strong long-distance while working separately on upcoming films—Lopez on The Mother based in Smithers, Canada, and Affleck on the sci-fi action thriller Hypnotic, based in Austin—though recently enjoyed the holidays together with each other’s families.

(AP) — Black Missouri school children no longer could be discriminated against for wearing natural hair under a bill advancing in the state Legislature. The House gave the measure initial approval Monday. The measure is aimed at helping kids who wear protective hairstyles such as afros, braids and twists to school. The bill was partly motivated by a New Jersey referee who told a high school wrestler to cut his dreadlocks in 2018. The bill sponsors say Missouri students have also been discriminated against for their natural hair. Another bill advanced Monday would require high schoolers to apply for federal college aid.

https://www.aldianews.com/leadership/entrepreneurs/6-places-eat-pa,Five PA restaurants make Yelp’s Best 100 list for 2022,"As most restaurants in the United States begin to reopen their doors with fewer restrictions, diners are also beginning beginning to marvel at the experience of eating out for dinner or lunch again.

To kick off 2022 and hopefully a year with less restrictions, Yelp has published its annual list of the 100 best places to eat, as voted by its users.

Reflecting the diversity of the platform's community, these rankings covers a wide range of eateries, from fine dining to street food trucks.

Participant Requirements

To determine what places would be part of the exclusive list for 2022, Yelp used data generated from the comments of its community and assigned ratings. The list was also filtered with the experiences of the owners and a trend expert to create a diverse list that holds true to the philosophy of the platform.

It is important to emphasize that one of the requirements applied by Yelp implies that dishes are affordable, meaning they don't exceed $30.

Cocina Madrigal, a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, tops this year's list that includes a wide variety of cuisines, including Afghan, Japanese, Honduran and Peruvian, among many others.

Across Pennsylvania, five places made it onto the list that celebrates food culture and the return of diners to in-person eating.

The Bakeshop on 20th (number 20 on the list)

“We are a small-batch bakery that specializes in recreating the flavors of your childhood using treasured family recipes,” the description of this cozy spot reads.

This Philadelphia bakery specialize in products like croissants, cookies, scones, sticky buns, and brownies. They also offer soups and breakfast sandwiches on their menu throughout the day. The most popular product on the menu is avocado toast. It is located at 269 S. 20th Street in Philadelphia.

Pho 75 (number 29 on the list)

“Heaven's cure for a hangover is served daily at our Vietnamese noodle shop which has the perfect formula: Easy diner atmosphere, friendly, fast service and huge bowls of delicious, steaming pho; yes, we do only one thing, and we do it well, but we do not accept plastic, so remember to bring cash,” the description reads of this Vietnamese restaurant, also in Philly.

Anytime you want a bowl of pho, this is the place to go. It's located in a shopping plaza just off Washington Avenue and is a can't-miss experience.

Gi-Jin (number 48 on the list)

Located in Pittsburgh, this restaurant specializes in hand-rolled sushi and gin, and is characterized by a balance of respect for Japanese technique, tradition, ingredients and moderation.

“Your experience will be fluid and effortless, with dishes that arrive at the table as soon as they are ready, with flavors that go from the lightest to the most daring,” reads the restaurant's own description.

It is located at 208 6th Street in Pittsburgh.

Frieda (number 66 on the list)

“At Frieda, we have one main goal: To create genuine connections between people of all generations and all social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds,” is the business mission of this restaurant that invites diversity in all forms.

Through seasonal menus, Frieda presents a European-inspired style of cooking, using ingredients sourced locally through partners like Lancaster Farm Fresh and The Common Market.

The restaurant is at 320 Walnut Street in Philadelphia.

Kooma (number 98 on the list)

Located in King of Prussia, PA, this sushi bar is characterized by offering unforgettable flavors and a fine presentation. Its ingredients are selected by hand and the chefs only use the freshest and highest quality products.

https://www.alternet.org/2022/01/now-every-day-in-arizona-is-january-6/,Now every day in Arizona is January 6,"Former President Donald J. Trump and his Republican allies are using three tactics in a nationwide, state-by-state strategy to control the outcome of future elections. All are on display in Arizona.

Tactic #1: Keep voters from voting

Arizona's latest voter restriction law will remove an estimated 100,000 eligible voters from its early voting mailing list. It won't begin deleting voters from the list until after the 2024 election. But Republicans have proposed new restrictions that could have a profound impact sooner, including new voter-ID requirements, severe limitations on the use of drive-up voting and ballot drop boxes, and requiring all voting to be in person on Election Day.

""We need to get back to 1958-style voting,"" Arizona State Rep. John Fillmore said, defending his proposals in a committee hearing on Jan. 26, 2022.

Ah, the good ol' days of 1958, when Arizona with its large Native American population imposed literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting, and about half of the Navajo voting-age population couldn't pass them.

Tactic #2: If the opposing candidate wins the popular vote, disregard It

Trump recently told the Pennsylvania GOP, ""Sometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate... We have to get tougher and smarter.""

He's putting those words into action.

In 2020, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs—a Democrat—was Arizona's top ""vote counter."" Now that she is running for governor, Trump has endorsed state Rep. Mark Finchem to replace her. Finchem addressed Trump's crowd at the ""Stop the Steal"" rally in Washington, D.C., on January 5, 2021, and attended the January 6 insurrection.

Gov. Doug Ducey, who is term-limited, signed the state's official certification of Biden's victory. To replace him, Trump has endorsed former Fox news anchor Kari Lake. She claims falsely that Trump won the election, advocates the imprisonment of Hobbs for unspecified election crimes, and demands that Arizona ""decertify"" Biden's electoral victory, which is impossible.

Republicans in Arizona are also working on a backup plan. They have proposed a law that would empower the state's legislature to ""accept or reject the election results."" If rejected, any voter could sue to request a new election.

Tactic #3: Bogus audits and investigations

After Trump lost in Arizona, his allies focused on Maricopa County, which accounted for 60 percent of the state's total. To its credit, the Republican-dominated Maricopa County Board of Supervisors withstood the pressure and certified Biden's 45,000 vote victory.

Nevertheless, in March 2021, the state senate's Republican president hired Cyber Ninjas to lead an outside audit of Maricopa County's 2.1 million ballots. The inexperienced firm's owner had touted Trump's election conspiracy theories and provided the ominous voiceover in ""The Deep Rig""—a movie claiming that Trump had won the election.

The state promised to pay Cyber Ninjas $150,000. Millions more poured in from outside sources, including pro-Trump fundraising groups led by his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump's election conspiracy-peddling lawyer Sidney Powell, and correspondents for the One America News Network.

The ""audit"" became a farce.

""It's clearer by the day: The people hired by the Senate are in way over their heads,"" said the Republican chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in May. ""This is not funny; this is dangerous."" In June, another Arizona GOP election official blasted the audit as ""insane from a competence standpoint.""

When Cyber Ninjas' final report made false, misleading, and inaccurate claims about the county's election process, Trump amplified them. He ignored the firm's conclusion: Biden's victory margin in the state had increased by 360 votes.

The mere existence of the bogus ""audit"" became fodder for Trump's talking points and spawned Republican demands for equally specious copycat audits across the country. By November 2021, a Monmouth University poll found that ""among Republicans, 32% say the so-called audit found evidence of fraud and 30% say it probably did.""

GOP State Sen. Wendy Rogers, a vocal supporter of Trump's Big Lie, seeks to operationalize the false claims. In December, she introduced a bill that would create a new bureau in the governor's office to investigate election fraud allegations. It would have the power to subpoena witnesses, conduct hearings, seek a court order impounding election equipment, and make prosecutorial referrals.

Moral: Even when Trump loses, he wins

In early January 2022, Maricopa County issued a detailed analysis demonstrating that Cyber Ninjas' report about its voting process made 22 misleading claims, 41 inaccurate claims, and 13 claims that were false.

""An empty piñata is a pretty accurate description of the 'audit' as a whole,"" the county tweeted.

On January 7, 2022, Cyber Ninjas shut down for good after a judge fined the company $50,000 a day for failing to turn over public records in accordance with a court's ruling in August.

But it was too little, too late. Trump still pretends that Cyber Ninjas somehow corroborated his Big Lie.

""If you look at the numbers, if you look at the findings in Arizona…,"" Trump told NPR's Steve Inskeep during a phone interview on January 11, 2022. ""This was a corrupt election… the findings are devastating for Arizona.""

When Inskeep asked Trump whether GOP candidates must embrace the Big Lie to get his endorsement, he launched into praise for Kari Lake.

""She's very big on this issue…,"" Trump said.

Without answering Inskeep's question, Trump continued his monolog of false claims and then hung up.

CHICAGO — Jason Van Dyke, the former Chicago Police officer convicted in 2018 of killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald will be released from prison next month after his release was approved by the Illinois Prisoner Review Board.

The board approved the former cop's release in September and Van Dyke will be freed on Feb. 3, WGN reported on Friday, citing court records. Multiple news outlets reported that McDonald's family was informed of the decision this week. Van Dyke was sentenced to 81 months in prison after he became the first Chicago Police officer in 50 years to be convicted of murder in connection with an on-duty incident. He was sentenced to a nearly seven-year sentence after prosecutors sought 18-20 years and defense attorneys asked for probation.

A jury convicted Van Dyke of second-degree murder and sixteen counts of aggravated battery in a trial that drew racial lines when a police dash-cam video was released showing Van Dyke, who is white, firing 16 times at the Black teen, who police said was carrying a knife.

Cook County Judge Vincent Gaughan handed down the sentence in what amounts to six-and three-quarter years. The judge said he based his decision on the more serious charge of second degree murder, and not the 16 counts of aggravated battery.

On Friday, Hunter told the Chicago Sun-Times that he says that the judicial system that sentenced Van Dyke needs to be overhauled.

“I’m hoping he’s learned the errors of his ways. I have always asked for justice and not revenge,” Hunter told the newspaper. “We got as much justice you could get with the players that were there at the time he was on trial. The system needs to be changed, it needs to be overhauled.” Jennifer Blagg, the attorney who represented Van Dyke until 2019 when he agreed not to appeal his conviction, told the Sun-Times that she hopes her former client can find privacy once he is released from prison next month.",Q1

Minnesotans unfurled banners and held up bright signs.

For the first time in nearly two years, typical goings-on at the state Capitol in St. Paul picked up as the Legislature started the 2022 legislative session on Monday, Jan. 31.

The pandemic and its impacts hung over lawmakers and visitors at the Capitol as they split over face mask use in the House of Representatives and debated extending worker compensation payments to those who got sick with COVID-19 on the job.

But many of the typical novelties were back on for the first time since 2020, as the building had loosened restrictions for lawmakers and visitors in attendance.

Supporters of a state equal rights amendment filled the Capitol rotunda to rally in support of ratifying the proposal in the Minnesota and federal Constitution.

Lobbyists and constituents filled the House and Senate galleries to watch the chambers gavel in and begin their work. And lawmakers got back to niceties such as exchanging treats and jokes on the House and Senate floors.

“Being in this place, being in the people’s house, being at a place where folks can gather to express their passions, this is what democracy is about,” Gov. Tim Walz said after he handed out trays of ""bipartisan"" lemon bars and Scotcheroos to legislators.

Walz said he hoped to start the session on a ""sweet note"" and took a dig of his own, noting, ""No one rejected them as Walz bars, so I'm glad of that.""

Legislative leaders of both partisan stripes said they were hopeful that lawmakers could tackle important issues this year. And they said while the Legislature was politically divided, legislators could work together.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Jeremy Miller, R-Winona, said he was hopeful that lawmakers there could stay focused on their top concerns: public safety, getting kids caught up in schools and getting relief out to Minnesotans.

“The election will take care of itself, our focus right now is on the 2022 legislative session and getting things done,” Miller said. “Let’s get serious about the issues that are in front of us, let’s stay focused on what’s best for the people of Minnesota.”

Miller and House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said some disagreements remained around who should be eligible for front-line worker checks but they hoped to get them out the door quickly.

""We should step up and do the right thing for these folks early in session,"" Hortman said.

They also said repaying the federal government for the state's unemployment insurance trust fund could also get done quickly. Without action on that front, Minnesota business owners could face a payroll tax hike to make up for the deficit in that fund.

Hortman said Democrats would like to move early in the session to spend $1 billion in hero paychecks to front-line workers and on paying back the federal government for the unemployment insurance fund. From there, lawmakers could debate how to use the rest in the coming months, she said.

Leaders also dug in on what they'd be willing to accept in terms of use for the state's historic $7.75 billion budget surplus.

Walz said he would block any tax relief for Minnesotans who make $20,000 or more a week and Democrats in both chambers said they'd also oppose targeting tax cuts to high-income earners.

Republicans, meanwhile, who'd said they'd prioritized permanent tax cuts, indicated that they would consider one-time tax relief: but only if that came in at a higher total than what Walz put forward.

The governor proposed sending out $700 million to Minnesotans that made below a certain threshold, which could make households eligible for up to $350.

“We might be OK with a one-time payment, but it’s got to be a heck of a lot bigger than what the governor is proposing and we’re not going to call it a Walz check,” Miller said. “That doesn’t even scratch the surface.""

Hortman said checks or other tax relief could be on the table for Democrats in that chamber.

""I think it is way too early to say how we get tax cuts back to Minnesotans,"" Hortman said. ""For the Minnesota House DFL, we're really focused on workers and we're focused on the people who need help the most, the people who are struggling from paycheck to paycheck.""

The House on Monday also moved ahead with a policy extending workers' compensation protections for those who become sick with COVID-19 while on the job, advancing the provision to the floor.

Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, introduced the proposal to extend workers' compensation for COVID-19 until May 31, 2023. The original legislation expired on Dec. 31.

He told the Labor, Industry, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee that 183,000 public safety, health care and other workers statewide are at risk of not receiving coverage if they get sick. Members of both parties on the committee raised concerns about moving forward before receiving input from the state’s Workers’ Compensation Advisory Council which is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the issue.

Still, the committee passed the bill along to the floor on an 8-5 vote on party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.

“This committee will always put workers and working families first as long as I am chair of this committee that will be our number one priority,” said committee chair Rob Ecklund, DFL-International Falls, before moving forward with the vote.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4480912,US expands travel bans on Chinese officials for persecution,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Monday expanded existing U.S. travel bans against Chinese officials whom it accuses of repressing ethnic and religious minorities.

The State Department said it is barring those targeted from traveling to the United States due to their involvement in crackdowns on freedom of speech and religion in China and abroad. The department did not identify which officials would be subject to the expanded ban nor say how many would be affected.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the sanctions are being applied to Chinese officials who “are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, policies or actions aimed at repressing religious and spiritual practitioners, members of ethnic minority groups, dissidents, human rights defenders, journalists, labor organizers, civil society organizers, and peaceful protestors in China and beyond.”

The move adds to visa restrictions originally imposed by the Trump administration over China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang as well as for repression of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and advocates for freedoms in Tibet.

“The United States rejects efforts by (Chinese) officials to harass, intimidate, surveil, and abduct members of ethnic and religious minority groups, including those who seek safety abroad, and U.S. citizens, who speak out on behalf of these vulnerable populations,” Blinken said. “We are committed to defending human rights around the world and will continue to use all diplomatic and economic measures to promote accountability.”

Just last week, the Justice Department announced charges against five men accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government in a series of brazen and wide-ranging schemes to stalk and harass Chinese dissidents in the United States.

The criminal cases, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, alleged longstanding efforts to dig up dirt on dissidents, intimidate them and stifle their speech.

It’s not the first time the Justice Department has brought charges for similar conduct: in 2020, prosecutors charged eight people with working on behalf of the Chinese government in a pressure campaign aimed at coercing a New Jersey man who was wanted by Beijing into returning to China to face charges.",Q1
http://www.tnledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=151896,Judge won't halt execution over intellectual disability,"VOL. 46 | NO. 12 | Friday, March 25, 2022

NASHVILLE (AP) — A judge on Tuesday dismissed a motion to declare a Tennessee death row inmate intellectually disabled, a move that would have prohibited his upcoming execution.

Senior Judge Walter Kurtz wrote that federal courts had previously determined Byron Black was not intellectually disabled and therefore was ineligible to have the decision considered once again. The 45-page decision comes despite agreement between Nashville's district attorney and Black's lawyers that he is intellectually disabled and should not be put to death.

Black is scheduled to be executed on Aug. 18 for his murder convictions in the April 1988 killings of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.

Black's attorneys had argued the 65-year-old should be spared under a 2021 law that made Tennessee's prohibition against executing people with intellectual disability retroactive, pointing out there is a different standard in place now than in 2004 — when the court found that Black didn't meet the now-obsolete definition of ""mental retardation."" Previously, Tennessee had no mechanism for an inmate to reopen a case to press an intellectual disability claim.

However, Kurtz ultimately concluded that the new state law does not apply to death row inmates who had previously received a ruling from a prior court.

""This Court fails to see how the federal courts' resolution of petitioner's intellectual disability claim can be seen as anything other than an adjudication on the merits under the legal and medical principles which are embodied in the most recent version of (Tennessee law),""Kurtz wrote. ""Given the above, the Court finds that Mr. Black had a full and fair previous adjudication on the merits of his intellectual disability claim.""

Black was convicted by a Nashville court in the deaths of girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her daughters Latoya, 9, and Lakesha, 6. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work release while serving time for shooting and wounding Clay's estranged husband.

Earlier this month, District Attorney Glenn Funk — Nashville's lead prosecutor — announced that he agreed with Black's legal team that the inmate was intellectually disabled and should instead face a sentence of life in prison.

Funk pointed to a newly changed conclusion by psychologist Susan Redmond Vaught, who was one of the state's experts in the 2004 determination, but has since said Black meets the new law's criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability. Another expert made the determination as well.

""Today's order says that even though the law has changed, the courthouse doors are closed to Byron Black,"" said Kelley Henry, Black's attorney. ""We will appeal this decision which, in our view, misinterprets Tennessee and federal law.""

Tennessee has five executions scheduled for 2022, including Black's. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the state has not put any inmates to death since February 2020, when Nicholas Sutton died in the electric chair. Black's execution had been set for October 2020, but the pandemic saw it rescheduled twice.",Q1

A lorry driver was accessing ""adult dating websites"" on his mobile phone shortly before causing a horror smash which killed three people on the A1(M).

Ion Nicu Onut was driving a 3.5 tonne Scania LGV, carrying fertilizer, when he ""ploughed"" into queueing traffic near junction 61 at Bowburn, County Durham, on July 15, last year.

The crash created a ""fireball"", and motorists, Paul Mullen, 51, from Washington , and Seaham couple Elaine Sullivan, 59, and David Daglish, 57, were tragically killed.

Onut, who was "" trawling the internet on dating sites looking for casual sexual partners"" at the time of the smash, was subsequently arrested and then charged with three counts of causing death by dangerous driving.

On Tuesday, the 41-year-old, of Woodstock Avenue, Galashiels, appeared at Durham Crown Court to be sentenced.

He had pleaded guilty to the charges at a previous hearing.

Romanian national

The court heard Onut, a Romanian national, was working as a HGV driver for CJ Hughes and Sons at the time of the crash.

He was, however, living in the Scottish Borders with his family, and on July 15 he began the day working down south.

He took regular stops as he made his way back up north and headed to the A19 before driving on to the A1(M).

Prosecutor, Nick Dry, said there had been a spillage of hydraulic fluid on the A1 at the time, and the hard shoulder had been closed off and warning signs were in use.

There was a 20-minute traffic delay and a 50mph speed limit was implemented.

As a result, the traffic had been reduced to “a crawl”, with the victims of the crash being part of the queuing traffic.

One motorist, who was travelling behind Onut’s lorry, became “concerned” at how the LGV was being driven.

It was “swerving” and “veering off” into the outside lane, the court heard.

Onut's driving was described as “erratic”, with the motorist travelling behind believing Onut may have fallen asleep.

But Onut continued driving, and failed to slow down before he “ploughed” into the back of the queuing traffic, which then “burst into flames”.

Mr Dry said the crash caused a “chain reaction” of collisions, and a “fireball” erupted.

One motorist called 999 and a passing nurse and Army servicemen stopped at the scene.

One man rescued Onut from his burning lorry cab and “dragged” him free.

Tragically, Paul Mullen, and couple Elaine Sullivan and David Daglish, “died instantly” at the scene.

Arrested

Onut was arrested but gave a 'no comment' interview, and the crash was investigated.

The weather conditions were described as “fine”, and the investigation established that the crash had been caused by Onut’s “failure to pay attention of the road ahead”.

Mr Dry said he was “oblivious to the stationary traffic” and was travelling at around 58mph at the time of the crash, with no sign of him braking.

One Vauxhall vehicle was “forced under” Onut’s lorry cab during the crash and was dragged along the carriageway.

The Vauxhall burst into flames and there was also a spillage of cement powder.

Other motorists also sustained severe injuries in the smash, with Onut’s lorry travelling around 100m from the point of the first impact.

Mobile phone use

Mr Dry said that Onut’s mobile phone was later examined, and revealed it had been used “extensively” during his journey.

His mobile phone showed that he had been using the internet throughout the day and that it was in “constant use”.

Mr Dry said the phone’s internet history showed Onut had been accessing “adult dating websites”, including “S**g Today” and “Mystic Match”.

He was using his phone at a time when his speed “never went below 50mph”.

The court heard that Onut bought £49 worth of “credits”, which enabled him to send messages and receive replies from “various females” on the sites.

Onut was even “editing his profile” during his journey and “directly preceding” the crash, he was “navigating” between both sites and profiles whilst using search functions.

Seconds before the crash, he was using the Mystic Match site, the court heard.

When police asked him about the internet activity, he made no comment.

Mr Dry added that Onut was “engrossed in his internet activity” while “in pursuit of sexual gratification”.

Onut was said to have “not braked at all” before the smash.

Family statements

During the hearing, the court heard statements from the victims’ families.

First to give a statement, was the son of Elaine Sullivan and David Daglish, Junior Sullivan.

He said that “no words can do justice to the pain and suffering” he now feels, and said he has served in the military, but that “nothing could prepare” him for being woken up by his pregnant wife and being told his parents had been killed in a car crash.

The daughter of Paul Mullen also gave a statement, saying he was due to be a granddad and was a ""devoted"" family man.

He was described by his family as being ""strong"" and was a man who ""seemed invincible"".

Apology

Richard Bloomfield, defending, said Onut had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and was of previous good character.

He added that apart from that, “there is not a great deal I can properly say”.

“He knows the seriousness of today and acknowledges it”, he said.

Mr Bloomfield added that Onut, “apologises” about the “devastation he has caused” and to the families who lost relatives and loved ones.

Jailed

Judge James Adkin, the Recorder of Durham, jailed Onut for eight years and 10 months, calling the incident ""catastrophic"".

He was also banned from driving for 14 years and five months and must take an extended test.

The judge added that there was a possibility Onut may be deported following his sentence.

Addressing Onut, the judge said he had been "" trawling the internet on dating sites looking for casual sexual partners"" before the horror smash.

https://theaviationist.com/2022/03/04/general-andrey-sukhovetsky-killed/,Reports: Russian Airborne Forces Commander Killed by Sniper in Hostomel,"Ukrainian sniper reportedly killed Russian Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky outside Kyiv.

Reports surfacing from Ukraine say that a Ukrainian sniper has killed a high ranking Russian officer in the city of Hostomel to the North of Kyiv. The reports surfaced in both Ukrainian and Russian social media and appear to be authentic. Russian media outlet Pravda acknowledged the news on Mar. 3, 2022.

Russian Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky was the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division in Novorossiysk for three years and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army.

Sukhovetsky was 47 years old and a “highly decorated veteran” who was appointed deputy army commander of the 41st division in October 2021. Maj. Gen. Sukhovetsky had completed combat deployments in the Chechen war, Abkhazia, and the intervention in Syria. He had participated in the traditional Russian Victory Day Parade in Moscow twice and also been awarded a special commendation for his participation in Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

The loss of a high-ranking general officer for the Russians is significant. And while this information originated from Ukrainian sources, Russian social media has corroborated the story before western sources confirmed them.

NEW – Russian commanders have been killed after they felt they had to move closer to the front lines, western officials say. Deputy Commander of the 41st combined arms Army killed by sniper fire. A divisional commander and a regimental commander also killed. — Gordon Corera (@gordoncorera) March 4, 2022

The news comes as reports suggest fierce fighting on the ground north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where a long convoy of Russian vehicles has been seen for several days.

A report from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry claimed that Ukrainian forces destroyed 20 Russian military vehicles in the area surrounding the Hostomel Airport [that has become famous for being the homebase of the only An-225 Mryia, the world’s largest cargo plane, that was destroyed in the fightings] on Thursday. Ukrainian sources claimed the fighting around Hostomel was being conducted by a Ukrainian special forces unit supported by partisans fighting against the Russian incursion.

Additional reports said that the capital city of Kyiv was hit by a Russian short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) strike overnight. Reports said one missile hit the central train station, where crowds of Ukrainians attempting to flee the capital city had been seen days before. Three more ballistic missiles hit either TV or radio stations in Kyiv according to the Ukrainian reports.

Intelligence experts have suggested that Russia is using its only Short-Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM) in service in Ukraine, the 9K720 Iskander-M mobile ballistic missile. The missile can deliver several different payloads including cluster munitions, high explosive and fuel-air explosives. One warhead that can be used on the Iskander-M produces an electromagnetic pulse to disable communications and radar capabilities.

The Iskander-M SRBM has a range of up to 500 kilometers with a minimum engagement range of 50 kilometers. It is specifically designed to evade anti-missile systems by flying a low trajectory where it is difficult to intercept.",Q1

from the more-of-this-please dept

It’s not often you see a cop face criminal charges for injuring or killing someone they’re attempting to arrest. It’s even rarer still to see a cop convicted. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is a unicorn. He knelt on George Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, choking the life out of the unarmed black man, who was suspected of nothing else than passing a bogus $20 bill at a local store. He did this for three minutes after another police officer told Chauvin he couldn’t detect a pulse.

Chauvin’s violence provoked protests around the nation targeting routine police violence that has gone unaddressed pretty much since law enforcement organizations were formed in the 1800s primarily to hunt down escaped slaves.

For this, Chauvin was convicted of murder and handed a twenty-two year sentence by a Minnesota judge who noted the officer’s actions abused his position of authority and were deployed with “particular cruelty.”

But what about the other officers present during Chauvin’s cruel and abusive display of force? Well, we have more unicorns to add to the list of anomalies. The three officers who watched and assisted Chauvin’s murder of George Floyd have all been convicted on federal charges.

Three former Minneapolis police officers were found guilty on Thursday of violating the civil rights of George Floyd, the Black man whose death at the hands of police in 2020 spurred protests against systemic racism around the world. The former officers, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, all were convicted of depriving Floyd of his civil rights while acting under government authority when they failed to give him medical aid. Kueng and Thao, additionally, were convicted of not intervening to stop their fellow officer Derek Chauvin from using excessive force.

Some justice finally. I mean, at least up until the appeals, during which anything could happen. The NBC News report notes each conviction contains the possibility of a life sentence but also points out sentences this lengthy are unlikely,

But, hey, we have the convictions! This is a good thing and will hopefully start moving towards being the new normal, rather than something that only happens when an entire nation starts burning following a killing of an unarmed black person by police officers. And these officers are still facing state charges for aiding and abetting the murder of George Floyd, which means these might not be the only convictions they’ll obtain for standing idly by while one of their own took the life of a Minneapolis resident.

If anything has the potential to change the law enforcement attitude that the people they serve are expendable, it’s convictions on serious criminal charges that will force them to rub elbows with people they’ve always considered to be less than human.

The path to these convictions ran through some truly gobsmacking defenses deployed by the accused officers. Officer Tou Thao actually claimed he didn’t believe George Floyd was being killed by Officer Derek Chauvin because other officers on the scene didn’t express any concern for Floyd’s wellbeing while Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck for nine uninterrupted minutes.

Thao testified that he never saw the officers reposition Floyd or begin rendering medical aid. Asked by his attorney Robert Paule if he found their lack of medical intervention “significant,” Thao said this shaped his view that Floyd wasn’t in any medical danger because of department policy that requires officers to begin CPR when someone in their custody or care doesn’t have a pulse. “If they are not doing CPR, then I assume he’s still breathing and fine,” Thao said. “It indicated that Mr. Floyd was not in cardiac arrest.”

Ah, the elliptical defense. Thao assumed Floyd wasn’t in medical distress because no officer had acted on Floyd’s repeated statement that he couldn’t breathe. Well done, Thao. Please remember that defense when your fellow prisoners deliver a savage beating and the guards claim they didn’t realize you were being injured because no other guard had attempted to determine whether you were in “medical danger.”

I am not here to praise the carceral state. I am only here to observe how rare it is for the justice system to deliver something approaching justice when it’s cops accused of criminal acts. And I’m also here to note with more than a little enjoyable schadenfreude that the cheerily dismissive platitudes offered by law enforcement officers (i.e., “if you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime,” etc.) now apply to some of their own. Let’s hope these unplanned field trips to the dehumanizing hellholes we ridiculously refer to as “correction facilities” will educate the cops that happen to pass through him and serve as a serious deterrent against future atrocities committed by officers.

http://www.capitalgazette.com/maryland/bs-md-ob-carlton-haywood-20220218-ntxkfu4skvglxkfcresinq3d34-story.html,"Carlton Haywood Jr., a health equity researcher who advocated for sickle cell disease patients, dies at 45","Dr. Carlton Haywood Jr., an assistant professor in the Berman Institute of Bioethics and in the division of hematology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, died Dec. 31 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Baltimore resident was 45.

A cause of death was unavailable.

Carlton Haywood Jr., son of Carlton Haywood Sr., a Ford Motor Credit Co. manager, and Harriett Haywood, a homemaker, was born in Atlanta, and due to the nature of his father’s work, was raised in Miami, Southfield, Michigan, Mobile, Alabama, Nashville, Tennessee, and Roanoke, Virginia, where he graduated from William Byrd High School.

“For the first three years of his life, Dr. Haywood screamed so often and so terribly that his parents, Carlton Sr. and Harriett Haywood, thought they must be doing something wrong,” according to a 2013 Baltimore Sun profile of him. “By 1979, when his sister Tammy was born, they had moved to Alabama, a state that mandated sickle cell testing for all newborns. She didn’t have the disease but carried some traits, so doctors suggested they test their son.”

The results were “devastating,” his mother told The Sun. “The doctors told us Carlton wouldn’t live through childhood. It was very, very difficult to deal with.”

Sickle cell disease affects approximately 100,000 Americans, and is most common among African Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Despite an unconventional childhood that was shaped by the disease, Dr. Haywood became a straight-A student, and was accepted to the University of Virginia, where he planned to study medicine. But early that first year, he came to realize that he didn’t like working in laboratories, and his adviser suggested another field of study.

“Intro to Bioethics changed my life,” Dr. Haywood told The Sun. “I loved reading about ethical dilemmas in medicine. It presented a whole new way of asking questions.”

“Think of the worst pain you’ve ever had — a broken bone or a migraine — and imagine it as a steady rainfall. Then it blossoms into a thunderstorm that lasts for hours,” said Hopkins bioethics professor Carlton Haywood Jr., pictured in 2013, on pain caused by sickle cell disease, which he battled since birth.

He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999 in religious studies and then obtained a master’s degree in 2003 from Virginia. He moved to Baltimore and completed a doctorate in health policy and bioethics in 2009 from the department of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“As a Ph.D. student, Carlton was awarded a competitive NIH-funded individual NRSA grant,” according to a Hopkins profile of Dr. Haywood. “He joined the faculty of the Berman Institute and the Department of Hematology with support from the Johns Hopkins Office of the Provost Mosaic Initiative.

“In recognition of his academic achievements, leadership, and numerous contributions to the field, upon graduation with his doctorate, he was also inducted into the Alpha Chapter of the Delta Omega Public Health Honor Society in 2009.”

Because he suffered throughout his life with sickle cell disease, Mr. Haywood became an advocate and champion for those who also suffered from it and worked diligently to improve their lives.

“Carlton brought a unique perspective to his health equity research, which was informed by his own experiences living with sickle-cell disease, and fervent desire to address the challenges that he and other patients faced,” according to the Hopkins profile. “His dissertation focused on patient-centered care and trust in the medical profession among adults with sickle-cell disease. This research was one of the very first studies to rigorously examine the construction of trust among patients with sickle-cell disease.”

His research was described by Hopkins as “groundbreaking.”

“His scholarship highlighted issues of extreme injustice, challenged assumptions, (such as a lack of interest in clinical trial preparation), and paved the way for improving quality of care for the sickle-cell population,” said the Hopkins profile. “In 2015, he was selected as one of the first recipients of the highly competitive Johns Hopkins University Catalyst Awards to examine how to improve the quality of nursing care for sickle-cell disease patients.”

Despite his own health challenges, Dr. Haywood traveled and lectured widely on sickle cell disease. He stressed that although it was an important public health problem, the research was underfunded.

Dr. Haywood’s work brought him numerous accolades, and in 2014, Ebony magazine placed him on its Power 100 list, which is “an annual celebration of the most influential and inspiring men and women in the African American community.” He was also one of three national sickle cell experts who testified before Congress.

Dr. Haywood served on Maryland’s Statewide Steering Committee on Services for Adults with Sickle Cell Disease. He was also a member of the National Human Genome Research Institute.

The Hopkins profile stated that Dr. Haywood would be remembered by his mentees, family and friends for his “brilliance, generosity, kindness, compassion and humility.”

Dr. Haywood, who lived at the Park Charles in downtown Baltimore, enjoyed collecting comic books, watching sci-fi and horror movies, and sipping pink lemonade.

Funeral services were held Jan. 29 at Gill Creek Baptist Church in Columbia, South Carolina.

Mr. Haywood is survived by his father, Carlton Haywood Sr. of Roanoke, Virginia, and mother, Harriett Haywood of Columbia, South Carolina; a brother, Atu Haywood of Houston; and two sisters, Tamara Haywood and Akiah Haywood, both of Columbia, South Carolina.",Q1
https://kesq.com/news/2022/01/20/palm-springs-quadruple-murder-trial-key-witnesses-expected-to-give-wednesday-testimony/,Undercover agents prepare to testify in Palm Springs quadruple murder trial,"It was a dramatic day Thursday in the trial for Palm Springs quadruple murder suspect Jose Larin Garcia, setting up crucial testimony that may come next week from undercover agents who spoke with the defendant at length after the crimes.

Before anyone took the stand, counsel for Larin Garcia shared he wasn't feeling 100 percent. The judge commented on his appearance, saying his eyes looked ""droopy,"" and his attorney said Larin Garcia was ""feeling warm."" He took a rapid Covid test that came back negative, and said he felt well enough to proceed.

Expected to testify were ""Perkins operation"" agents, undercover officers who posed as inmates at the Banning jail the day after the murders. They were trying to obtain recorded statements from the accused murderer.

The defense argued that because Larin Garcia invoked his Miranda rights, the right to remain silent, the undercover interview was illegal.

But the judge decided, based on cases that allowed statements made by suspects to undercover agents, that the Perkins operation was fair game.

The recordings, which are reportedly hours long and in Spanish, will not be played in court. But the agents will soon take the stand, likely on Monday – with their testimony highly crucial to the case.

It could reveal if Larin Garcia incriminated himself while speaking in the jail cell.

After a contentious morning working out the details, the jury was dismissed for the weekend. Courthouse officials said a juror was unable to return after lunch, and the trial is dark Fridays.

Wednesday, forensic experts gave testimony including a crime scene technician, a fingerprint examiner and a blood expert.

The defense argues blood spatter on Larin Garcia's clothing is the only evidence linking him to the murders, saying it's there because he was a witness and not the killer.

BACKGROUND:

Jose Larin Garcia, a Cathedral City man, is accused of killing four people (ages 17-25): Carlos Campos, Jacob Montgomery, Yuliana Garcia and Juan Duarte Raya nearly three years ago.

Jose Larin Garcia, 22

The four victims were all found shot and killed on the night of February 3rd, 2019.

Three of the victims were found inside a car that crashed at Sunny Dunes and El Placer roads. The fourth victim was discovered in the street on Canon Dr. few blocks away.

When police arrived on scene, they found Larin Garcia hiding under a truck. They say he appeared intoxicated and covered in blood.

Larin Garcia was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center for treatment. Security footage shows him running away from the property later that night.

Detectives have testified he then went to a friend’s house who he had buy him a one-way bus ticket to Florida using a fake name. Prosecutors say he was preparing to flee – shaving his head and beard to change his appearance. He was arrested waiting at the bus stop. https://973f2fb4ddf96c0e483df7c0fc14d511.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-38/html/container.html

Larin Garcia is charged with four counts of murder. He also faces a special-circumstance allegation of committing multiple murders, opening him to the death penalty if convicted.

WEEK 3 IN COURT:

The third week in this trial, jurors heard from John Olvera, the 18-year-old who the defense argues is actually responsible. Police investigated posts on his social media accounts that appeared to take credit for the murders, but Olvera testified in several instances he was publishing rap lyrics or ""fronting"" as a ""wannabe gangster.""

Department of Justice forensics specialist Nancy McCombs testified and said the multiple bullet casings that were recovered could have come from the same gun. No weapon was ever found in the investigation.

Prosecutors poked holes in testimony from one witness who changed his previous account on the stand, and Palm Springs police investigators testified about the evidence collected from the scene.https://youtube.com/embed/zyqjtgu2vhE&feature=emb_title

WEEK 2 IN COURT:

During the second week in court, the jury heard from Larin Garcia's mother, who says she received a call from her son on the night of the murders.

Two police officers who responded on the night of the murders also took the stand. One testified he saw a 'tall, thin' figure running near one of the crime scenes, but that person was never found or brought in for questioning. Larin-Garcia is not described as tall or thin. The court also heard from a family friend of Larin Garcia who helped him buy a one-way ticket to Florida the day after the murders. Larin Garcia was arrested before he could depart.

The court also heard from several witnesses including a neighbor, police detective and former friend of the accused. The friend shared that Larin Garcia had said he wanted to rob one of the victims prior to the killings.

WEEK 1 IN COURT:

During the first week in court, the prosecution delivered their opening statement. The defense then delivered their opening statement, arguing another man, John Olvera, is responsible for the four deaths.

Several witnesses were called to the stand, including a Palm Springs Police Department Dispatch Supervisor, several neighbors who heard gunshots or saw the victims' bodies, and individuals who knew the victims personally. The court also learned that 17-year-old victim Yuliana Garcia was pregnant at the time of her death.",Q1
https://torrentfreak.com/internet-freedom-day-how-blackout-protests-killed-two-anti-piracy-bills-170118/,Internet Freedom Day: How Massive 'Blackout' Protests Killed Two Anti-Piracy Bills * TorrentFreak,"Five years ago today the Internet went on strike to fight SOPA and PIPA, two anti-piracy bills. As part of the historic protests tech giants such as Google and Wikipedia stood by many smaller players in a massive ""Internet blackout,"" which helped to defeat the bills. Since then, January 18 has become known online as ""Internet Freedom Day.""

At the start of the decade several new bills were introduced in the United States, aiming to make it easier for copyright holders to enforce their rights online.

The proposals, including SOPA and PIPA, would’ve streamlined the shutting down of allegedly infringing domain names and threatened to increase liability for third party services, among other things.

Fearing broad Internet censorship, the proposals ignited a wave of protests led by various activist groups. But, what started as a small protest movement was swiftly elevated to mainstream news, when tech giants such as Google and Wikipedia joined in.

Exactly five years ago, following months of scattered protests, the opposition peaked into a massive Internet blackout campaign.

As a result, the balance of power tipped and Hollywood and the music industry were forced into retreat. Soon after the blackout, both bills were declared dead, a victory which is still frequently referenced today.

A year after the succesfull blackout campaign, January 18 was declared Internet Freedom Day. While the first celebration attracted international news headlines, it’s now become a relatively small event.

Still, many of the concerns that were brought up half a decade ago remain relevant today. Site blocking efforts and domain name seizures are still high on the agenda, and the same is true for search engine ‘censorship’ and liability for ISPs and other third party services.

What has changed is that, instead of tackling these issues through legislation, rightsholders are now focusing on individual lawsuits and voluntary agreements.

This means that for activists, Internet Freedom Day could still be relevant now, both as a remembrance and as a call to action. In any case, it’s worth noting that without the protests things could have been very different today.

Below are a few of the many ‘blackout’ pages that were up (or down) five years ago.

Wikipedia

Wikipedia was completely inaccessible for 24 hours, except the pages about censorship, PIPA and SOPA, of course.

Google

Google blacked out its logo to protest PIPA/SOPA and added a link to a resource page where people could take action.

Reddit

Reddit directed its users to a resource site where they could take action.

Imgur

Firefox

Firefox users were welcomed with a dark themed default homepage, alerting people about the looming PIPA/SOPA threats.

Craigslist

The online classified advertisements portal Craigslist directed the public to a resource site where they could take action.

https://apnews.com/fe7bbb8707328abc6fd49f3ad68ced3a,US returns billionaire’s plundered artifacts to Jordan,"JERUSALEM (AP) — American authorities have returned nine looted artifacts to Jordan that were seized from a U.S. billionaire collector as part of a landmark deal announced in December.

The artifacts were among 180 items seized by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office as part of an agreement with collector Michael Steinhardt to surrender trafficked artifacts and avoid prosecution. The deal capped a four-year investigation into Steinhardt’s possession of looted antiquities.

The Jordanian Antiquities Ministry and the U.S. Embassy in Jordan held a ceremony in Jordan’s capital, Amman, on Tuesday showcasing the objects that were “illegally smuggled from Jordan and obtained by an antiquities collector in the United States,” the embassy said in a statement.

“This is a testament to the United States’ commitment to help protect Jordan’s cultural heritage. With today’s repatriation of Jordanian antiquities, we are keeping this promise,” Ambassador Henry T. Wooster said.

The American and Jordanian authorities’ press statements did not mention Steinhardt by name, but seven of the artifacts that appeared in photos published by the ministry matched the description of Jordanian items in court documents.

Two ancient Jewish tombstones that were plundered from Jordan and bought by Steinhardt from an Israeli antiquities dealer did not appear in photos from the press conference. The director of the Jordanian Antiquities Ministry did not respond to request for comment.

Since the Manhattan District Attorney’s office announced the agreement in December, U.S. authorities have returned Steinhardt’s plundered artifacts to Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Libya, Iraq, and now Jordan. Steinhardt was not accused of plundering any items himself and has said he did not commit any crime. But the DA’s office said he “knew, or should have ascertained by reasonable inquiry” that the antiquities were stolen.

More than two dozen artifacts that had been plundered from Israel and the occupied West Bank are expected to be returned to Israeli authorities later this month, the Israeli Antiquities Authority said.

Of the 40 artifacts being repatriated to Israel as part of the deal, at least 22 are believed to have been plundered from West Bank sites, according to court documents. Steinhardt “has been unable to locate” nine of those pieces, and another three are on display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

The museum recently removed Steinhardt’s name from the display label for two Neolithic masks he had loaned.

The DA’s office said the artifacts from the occupied West Bank will be returned to the Israeli government “pursuant to the Oslo Accords,” the 1995 interim agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, which says the return of West Bank artifacts to the Palestinians should be resolved in a still-elusive final peace deal.

Jihad Yassin, a Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Ministry official, said that the materials that came from the West Bank should be returned to the Palestinians, and that his department was preparing to submit a report to UNESCO about the issue.

Steinhardt, 81, is a hedge fund founder and philanthropist who chairs the Steinhardt Foundation for Jewish Life. He is also co-founder of Birthright Israel, an organization that sends young Jews on free trips to Israel and a prominent patron of the Israel Museum and other institutions in the country.",Q1

https://www.q13fox.com/news/biden-administration-officially-withdraws-covid-19-vaccine-rule,Biden administration officially withdraws COVID-19 vaccine rule,"The Biden administration has officially withdrawn a rule that would have required workers at big companies to get vaccinated or face regular COVID testing requirements.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed the withdrawal Tuesday. But the agency said it still strongly encourages workers to get vaccinated.

In early November, OSHA announced a vaccine-or-test mandate for companies with at least 100 employees. The rule __ which would have impacted more than 80 million U.S. workers __ was originally set to go into effect on Jan. 4.

But numerous states and business groups challenged the rule in court. On Jan. 13, the Supreme Court halted the plan. In a 6-3 ruling, the court's conservative majority concluded that OSHA had overstepped its authority.

""OSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress,"" the court's majority wrote. ""Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here.""

The justices left in place a vaccine mandate for health care providers who receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding. That rule affects 10.4 million workers.

U.S. corporations have been split over whether to mandate employee vaccinations. United Airlines began requiring vaccines in August; the company says 99% of its workers have been vaccinated or have requested medical or religious exemptions. Tyson Foods, which also announced a mandate in August, says 96% of its workers were vaccinated by a Nov. 1 deadline.

But other big businesses, including Starbucks and General Electric, scrapped previously announced vaccine mandates for their employees after the Supreme Court's ruling.

OSHA indicated that the rule could return in some form. While it is no longer an enforceable standard, it remains a proposed rule, OSHA said. For now, the agency said it will prioritize the health care mandate.

David Michaels, an epidemiologist and former OSHA administrator who now teaches at The George Washington University, said the agency could consider a new rule that would include other measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces, such as requiring face masks, distancing, and better ventilation systems.

Yeah, not even close.

Team Biden on Wednesday canceled two major mineral leases, effectively killing the project and handing a major win to environmentalists. As reported by Mining.com, the U.S. Department of the Interior canceled the leases for Antofagasta PLC‘s proposed Twin Metals copper and nickel mine in Minnesota, throwing yet another Biden campaign promise under the bus — this one made to America’s miners.

Terrible yet disappointingly predictable news today: Joe Biden and his Democrat allies completely ignored science and banned mining. https://t.co/vvFEYXWUXE — Pete Stauber (@PeteStauber) January 26, 2022

As reported by Reuters in October 2020, then-candidate Biden told miners he would support boosting domestic production of metals used to make electric vehicles — we know how much Joe loves electric vehicles — solar panels, and other products “crucial to his climate plan.”

Just one problem.

As noted by Yahoo, electric vehicles (EVs) use a “ton” of copper — particularly when compared with “fossil fuel burning” vehicles. (Emphasis, mine.)

[Copper] is an essential component in EVs, and is used in electric motors, batteries, inverters and wiring. Also, the EV charging infrastructure is largely based on copper-based technologies. Copper is a key component of charging infrastructure and is found in cables, transformers and wiring to the electric panel. Importantly, usage of copper in EVs is up to 4 times more than in conventional cars. Per the Copper Development Association Inc., traditional cars have 18-49 pounds of copper, hybrid EVs contain approximately 85 pounds and plug-in hybrid EVs use 132 pounds. While battery BEVs contain 183 pounds, a hybrid electric bus and a battery-electric bus contain 196 and 814 pounds of copper, respectively.

Um, Joe?

According to Mining.com, the leases for the proposed mine in northern Minnesota had first been pulled by then-President Barack Obama’s administration in 2016. (Who knew?) But Donald Trump’s administration reversed that decision. Biden officials on Wednesday said Trump erred in giving the leases back, said U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as transcribed by Mining. com:

“We found the leases were improperly renewed in violation of applicable statutes and regulations, and we are taking action to cancel them,” [and to] ensure that no lessee receives special treatment.

Shockingly, Haaland didn’t elaborate on any “special treatment.”

Twin Metals, which is controlled by Chile’s Antofagasta, is convinced the decision to cancel the leases was based solely on politics and not science. Hmm. Politics vs. science. We’ve seen this movie for two years, haven’t we? In “another area,” I mean? Said Twin Metals spokesperson Kathy Graul:

We will challenge this attempt to stop our project and defend our valid existing mineral rights. We expect to prevail.

Best wishes to the efforts of Twin Metals, of course, but Biden has had his “climate change” sights on Minnesota copper mining since at least October, as reported by CBS Minnesota at the time.

The administration announced it had ordered a study that could lead to a 20-year ban on mining upstream from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Antofagasta hoped to build an underground mine in the area that would supply copper for electric vehicles, Joe’s favorite mode of transportation. Except for Amtrak, of course, but I digress.

Becky Rom of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters conservation group was thrilled by the administration’s latest “climate change” nail in the copper-mining industry coffin. Per Mining.com:

It is heartening to have an administration making decisions with integrity. Twin Metals leases should never have been reinstated in the first place, and this announcement should stop the Twin Metals mine threat.

And Joe “Existential threat of our time” Biden gladly folded up like a cheap suit.

By cancelling a pair of mineral leases near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness on Wednesday, the Biden administration granted a major victory to ecologists and wildlife advocates who’ve argued the mines would contaminate the preserve. https://t.co/0TF4vF8SNb — Outside (@outsidemagazine) January 28, 2022

Just one more problem. Consider the following headlines:

Forbes, June 2021: The Race for Copper, the Metal of the Future

Bloomberg, March 2021: The World Will Need 10 Million Tons More Copper to Meet Demand

S&P Global, October 2021: Energy Transition to Boost Demand for Copper, Nickel Over Next Decade

CNBC, July 2021: Why a Looming Copper Shortage Has Big Consequences for the Green Economy

Yet, as he did on Day One by killing Keystone XL, Biden now seeks to create a crisis in America’s copper and nickel mining industry. But fear not my fellow Americans, Joe can always resort to plan B.

As with the case when Biden killed Keystone and raced to once again make America energy-dependent, Joe can always beg Russia and China for copper and nickel.

On the first anniversary of the January 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol it is critical to remember the condemnation from the U.S. military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on January 12, 2021: “The violent riot in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 was a direct assault on the U.S. Congress, the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process. We mourn the deaths of the two Capitol Policemen and others connected to these unprecedented events. … As Service Members, we must embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution. Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath, it is against the law.”

Earlier, nine former secretaries of defense, all but two Republicans, said: “The time for questioning the results (of the presidential election) has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived.” Trump did not listen: “The President of the United States summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing” (Wyoming GOP Representative Liz Cheney).

About 140 Capitol police officers were injured by the mob using “flagpoles, bike racks and projectiles” (Washington Post). Some rioters had guns and crude bombs. More than 725 mob members have been arrested and charged, including six Wisconsinites. Many have pleaded guilty. However, Trump’s attempt to prevent Joe Biden’s being confirmed as president nearly succeeded. Trump did nothing to stop the violence for hours, while watching the riot on TV. It’s likely he hoped members of Congress would be assaulted, perhaps even Vice President Pence. All of this is a stunning refutation of the lies and perfidy of GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, GOP Senator Ron Johnson and 3rd congressional district (CD) GOP candidate Derrick Van Orden.

Van Orden, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, endorsed by Trump, is running for the open 3rd CD seat. He acts like a human flame-thrower, full of vitriol and character assassination. Opponents are disparaged as socialists. Van Orden is nothing like the decent capable legislators, including Democrat Al Baldus, Republican Steve Gunderson and Democrat Ron Kind, who have represented the 3rd CD in Congress. Worse, Van Orden improperly used campaign funds to travel to the January 6th insurrection “to stand for the integrity of our electoral system … .” Code for illegally overturning Trump’s presidential election loss and the will of most voters.

Voters should heed Admiral William McRaven, U.S. Navy (Ret.) who was in charge of the SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden. McRaven, also a SEAL, said: “Trump is actively working to undermine every major institution in this country. He has planted the seeds of doubt in the minds of many Americans that our institutions aren’t functioning properly.” McRaven also compared Trump to an “autocrat”.

Voters must reject a dangerous demagogue such as Van Orden to represent the 3rd CD.

Lake Tahoe Interagency Bear Team warns of bears coming out of hibernation

By Gustavo Sagrero

As the weather gets warmer, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Bear Team is warning people about bears coming out of hibernation and foraging through the area burned in the Caldor Fire.

The bears are eating grubs and termites, which are plentiful in the downed and decaying trees. More than 200,000 acres burned last year. During the evacuations last year, neighborhoods were abandoned. That led bears - who were already testing their boundaries with humans - to freely roam neighborhoods.

To keep them away, the bear team is urging businesses and residents to keep trash in bear-resistant containers, lock up dumpsters, and stop using attractants like bird feeders. It’s also reminding people that it’s illegal to feed bears.

New federal data shows the pandemic’s impact on the number of fatal workplace injuries. In some Western states, fewer people died at work. In Nevada, 37 were killed on the job. The annual report covers 2020, the most recent year for which data was available.

Matthew Insco of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that’s likely due to pandemic-related business closures.

“Nationwide, we looked at data from 2019 to 2020, and we actually saw an 11% decrease in fatalities,” Insco said.

Still, the rate of fatal injuries went up in Nevada, because the overall size of the labor force dropped. Same goes for Arizona and Wyoming, which was ranked highest in the nation with 13 deaths per 100,000 workers. Colorado, Nevada and Utah were at or below the national average.

Insco says the economy of each state influences mortality rates, too. Transportation-related incidents were the most common type of fatality.

UNR receives nearly $150,000 for drought research

By Gustavo Sagrero

The University of Nevada, Reno will receive about $150,000 from the National Science Foundation to come up with ideas to address drought in the region. The grant will create a “Nevada Water” partnership, pulling together public, private, tribal and nonprofit groups to work together on sustainable water projects.

Research looks at the impact of wildfire smoke on nursing homes

By Rachel Cohen, Boise State Public Radio for the Mountain West News Bureau

Elderly adults are particularly vulnerable to wildfire smoke. A research team at Boise State University is studying how these small particles make their way into nursing homes.

Two years ago, researchers, including assistant professor Luke Montrose, placed indoor and outdoor air quality sensors at four skilled nursing facilities across Idaho.

2020 was a record-setting wildfire year for the West, and especially California. And the smoke from those fires made its way to Idaho.

“Some facilities did really well, even when there was an outdoor event, to keep the air relatively clean. Other facilities were less so able to do that,” Montrose said.

Data from the sensors showed Montrose that all four facilities were affected by smoke, but some more than others. A new grant will help the team, which includes the university’s center for the study on aging, understand how things like HVAC systems or opening and closing windows affect smoke in a facility.

“There are things that we think we can learn from the facilities that do a good job, that we could then use to then help the other facilities do better,” Montrose said.

Montrose thinks the findings could apply to other buildings with vulnerable populations, including schools.

California calls for more local water conservation

By The Associated Press

Nearly all Californians will be asked to further cut back on their water use as drought continues in the nation’s most populous state. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed an executive order to require cities and local water districts to adopt stricter conservation rules. He’s also directed the state water board to consider a ban on watering of grass used for purely ornamental purposes.

Newsom administration officials say local officials are better poised than the state to dictate limits on water use because they understand community needs. Restrictions could include further limiting household’s outdoor water use or less frequently watering parks and other public spaces.

California considers letting election workers hide addresses

By The Associated Press

Some California election workers could keep their home addresses hidden from public records under a bill in the Legislature. The bill is in response to an increasing number of threats against election workers following the 2020 presidential election. It’s one of a number of proposals states are considering to protect election workers.

A survey of election workers from across the country found 1 in 6 have experienced threats because of their job. The bill cleared a legislative committee in the California Assembly on Monday. California also lets domestic violence victims and abortion providers hide their addresses.

https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/watch-candy-trailer-reveals-an-unrecognizable-jessica-biel/,Watch: ‘Candy’ trailer reveals an unrecognizable Jessica Biel,"The first trailer for Candy, a new Hulu miniseries featuring an unrecognizable Jessica Biel as the titular antagonist, teases a true story thriller of small-town murder and mayhem that would make the Coen brothers’ jaw drop.

Recommended Videos

Based on actual events that occurred in Texas in 1980, the story centers around the titular murderer, Candy Montgomery, and her victim, Betty Gore (Melanie Lynskey). Candy seemed to have it all, including a loving husband with a stable job, a daughter and son, and an idyllic house in the suburbs. So why did she kill her fellow church pal with an axe?

The miniseries comes from Mad Men scribe Robin Veith and Brand New Cherry Flavor writer Nick Antosca.

The true story was previously adapted into a made-for-TV movie back in 1990 for CBS called A Killing in a Small Town. Barbara Hershey won a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries for the role of Candy Morrison, whose name was lightly altered from the real-life story.

Today, we have a very different TV landscape in the form of streaming services, like Hulu, compared to 1990. As such, miniseries nowadays can sometimes have high production values like the ones seen in movies. That, combined with a stunningly different take by Biel from her typical roles, piques our curiosity for the kind of thrills that Candy might bring.

Candy, billed as a five-night event, comes to Hulu May 9.

The agreement was recently signed by Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď (OĽaNO) and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, but it still needs the approval of the parliament and subsequently the president.

The MPs are expected to continue in session until the debate is over, with the voting on the deal scheduled for February 9 at 11:00. It is not clear how many will support the deal, as some coalition deputies planned to vote against it. Moreover, the voting may be affected by Covid as some deputies need to be under home isolation, the Sme daily reported.

The parliamentary debate has been accompanied by several incidents from the very beginning, which include the blockade of the speaker’s desk and booing (mostly by far-right politicians) and protest held in front of the parliamentary building attended by several hundred people.

General prosecutor not allowed to speak

Originally, General Prosecutor Maroš Žilinka came to the session, expressing his will to read an address concerning the DCA. He is known as the critic of the agreement. During the interdepartmental review process, he submitted 35 fundamental objections to the draft and his office has rejected it as a whole.

Yet, the MPs did not allow him to speak to the plenum. He then left, evading journalists.

The employees of the General Prosecutor’s Office subsequently handed copies of his address to the journalists. Over 25 pages, Žilinka explains why the DCA is disadvantageous for Slovakia.

Opposition protest lured hundreds to downtown Bratislava Read more

He called the interpretation clauses attached to the agreement by both Slovakia and the USA insignificant, and even called the agreement on the stay of Soviet soldiers on the territory of Czechoslovakia after the 1968 invasion more advantageous than the current defence deal with the USA.

“A person’s own opinion and will are actually his honour,” he claimed.

Žilinka later wrote on Facebook that he wanted to ask the MPs to show their disagreement with the DCA.

Incidents caused by far-right politicians

The parliamentary discussion has been interrupted several times, mostly due to incidents initiated by the far-right MPs.

Members of the People’s Party Our Slovakia (ĽSNS) led by Marian Kotleba came to the speaker’s desk, carrying the Slovak flag, without covering their faces. The current valid rules stipulate that people are required to wear FFP2 respirators inside any building, apart from their own household.

Later, they were joined by the MPs for the junior coalition party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS), who brought and unfolded the Ukrainian flag. One ĽSNS MP subsequently snatched the flag and even snatched off the respirator from one deputy’s face. Another SaS MP was drenched in water.

The ĽSNS MPs then continued blocking the speaker’s desk, despite being ordered to leave the assembly hall by Speaker of Parliament Boris Kollár (Sme Rodina).

During the speeches of several MPs, including Defence Minister Naď, the far-right MPs were booing and blowing whistles, so it was not sufficiently clear what the MPs were saying. Some from the far-right were even listening to music played from their computers.

Responding to these incidents, Za Ľudí MP Juraj Šeliga said that he will propose at the March session the creation of a parliamentary guard to prevent similar incidents in the future.

“The behaviour of Kotleba’s MPs today is unacceptable,” he wrote on Facebook.

https://thecounter.org/common-swine-drug-under-review-fda-carbadox-carcinogen-phibro/,"A common swine drug, banned in Canada, Australia, and the EU, is now under review by the FDA","You may not have heard of an antibiotic called carbadox, but its usage in treating sick swine has been common in the U.S. since the ‘70s—despite the fact that it’s a likely carcinogen, shown to cause tumors in lab animals. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was seeking to ban carbadox back in 2016 at the tail end of the Obama administration, going so far as to announce that it intended to allow the drug maker to request a hearing on the matter. That never happened.

“Things pretty much just stalled during the next four years, as we had the new administration coming in,” said Steven Roach, Safe and Healthy Food Program director for humane farming nonprofit Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT). According to a spokesman for FDA, who answered questions from The Counter via email, the agency backed away from its original plan after it determined that the main concern about carbadox centered on the inadequacy of the method drug maker Phibro Animal Health used to measure carcinogenic residues in pork tissue.

So, on March 10, the agency held a public hearing on that measurement method. If FDA decides that method should be revoked, the agency will pursue yet another hearing—the next one to potentially ban carbadox use in hogs. The FDA spokesman said this could lead to the agency withdrawing approval of all new animal drug applications for carbadox’s use. This effective ban would put the U.S. in line with the European Union, Canada, and Australia, where carbadox has been disallowed for a number of years.

Carbadox is added to livestock feed to control diarrhea in young pigs after they are weaned from their mothers, as well as to promote their growth (despite a federal ban on antibiotic use for growth promotion, it’s allowed for carbadox). And though Phibro leaned heavily on the drug’s medical necessity at last week’s hearing, company marketing materials focus primarily on how carbadox helps fatten pigs rapidly. FACT, the only group to present anti-carbadox comments at FDA’s hearing, estimates that over 50 percent of U.S. hog farmers use the drug, while Bloomberg put that estimate considerably higher—90 percent. Although FDA explicitly disallows carcinogenic drugs in treating animals, a proviso allows their use if no residues of them are “found by an approved regulatory method in any edible tissues of or foods from the animal.” Phibro maintains that its continued use in hogs is essential to production, and to human health.",Q1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/3/hezbollahs-nasrallah-accuses-saudi-arabia-of-terrorism,Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah accuses Saudi Arabia of ‘terrorism’,"Beirut, Lebanon – Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has accused Saudi Arabia of exporting ISIL (ISIS) ideology and transporting cars rigged with explosives for suicide attacks to Iraq.

In a televised speech on Monday, he addressed Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdul Aziz.

“Your Majesty, the terrorist is who exported the Daesh ideology to the world,” Nasrallah said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIL.

“The terrorist is the one who sent thousands of Saudis to conduct suicide operations in Iraq and Syria, and it’s you.”

Nasrallah also slammed the kingdom for its close ties with the United States and for the military campaign it is leading in Yemen.

Nasrallah’s comments came in response to political opponents and critics in Lebanon who criticised the Iran-backed party for damaging ties between the cash-strapped country and Saudi Arabia.

“We didn’t attack Saudi Arabia. They were involved in the greater conspiracy that was destroying the region,” the Hezbollah leader said.

Following the speech, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati’s office said in a statement Nasrallah’s comments did not reflect the government’s position and a broad segment of the population. It added the government was committed to dissociating from regional conflicts, and urged all political forces to cooperate to get the country out of its economic crisis.

“While we call for Hezbollah to be part of Lebanon’s diverse affiliation, its leadership is in opposition to this trend with positions that first harm the Lebanese and secondly Lebanon’s relations with its brothers,” the statement read. “For God’s sake, have mercy on Lebanon and the Lebanese, and stop the hateful political and sectarian charge.”

Strained ties

Lebanon is struggling to resolve a diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, which have been critical of Hezbollah for their role in Yemen and other regional conflicts.

In October, the Gulf states withdrew their ambassadors, and Saudi Arabia banned all Lebanese exports, after a video surfaced of the then-Information Minister George Kordahi criticising the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman in a speech last week called on Lebanon to stop “the hegemony of terrorist Hezbollah over the Lebanese state”.

Hezbollah has recently come under scrutiny from key allies the Free Patriotic Movement, one of Lebanon’s most important Christian political parties, founded by President Michel Aoun.

Last week, Aoun indirectly criticised Hezbollah for straining relations with Gulf countries by “interfering in matters that do not concern”, as well as its military dominance as an armed group in Lebanon.

Tribute to Soleimani

Nasrallah’s speech marked the second anniversary of the assassination of senior Iranian military official General Qassem Soleimani.

Soleimani headed the elite Iranian Quds Force from 1998 until he was assassinated in January 2020 in a United States drone attack near Baghdad international airport.

“The assassination established a new stage of awareness, insight, and knowledge of the main enemy,” Nasrallah said, referring to the US, who he accused of “creating Daesh in Iraq and Syria”.

“The martyr Hajj Qassem Soleimani resisted the American occupation of Iraq, contributed to establishing the Iraqi resistance factions, and provided them with money, weapons, strength, hope, and confidence until the great victory and expulsion of the American forces from Iraq,” Nasrallah added.

The Quds Force, the foreign arm of the IRGC, played a key role in the fighting in Syria and Iraq and is responsible for spreading Iranian influence in the Middle East. Soleimani had played a critical role in militarily backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and strengthening ties with Hezbollah, Iraqi paramilitary units Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces), and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, dubbed the “Axis of Resistance”.

With Iran’s support, Hezbollah transformed into a regional paramilitary force that played a crucial role in supporting the Assad government in Syria and Iran-backed militias in Iraq. It is also a major political party with parliamentarians and ministers within the Lebanese government.",Q1

The guards — Tova Noel and Michael Thomas — had agreed to deferred prosecution deals last May that required them to admit their guilt with the understanding that charges in a federal indictment would be dismissed if they followed the rules of their agreement for six months.

They also were required to do 100 hours of community service.

Prosecutors last week requested the charges be dropped, and Judge Analisa Torres ordered the dismissal Monday.

Epstein, 66, was awaiting a sex trafficking trial when he took his life in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in August 2019.

The death, a major embarrassment to the Bureau of Prisons, touched off intense scrutiny of operations at the federal jail adjacent to two large federal courthouses in lower Manhattan.

It is currently closed.

In court papers, prosecutors said Noel and Thomas were at their desks just 15 feet (4.5 meters) from Epstein's cell as they shopped online for furniture and motorcycles and failed to make required rounds every 30 minutes.

The indictment alleged that both appeared to have fallen asleep for one two-hour stretch.

Their lawyers blamed their sleepiness on staff shortages that caused them to work excessive overtime.

In a release, attorney Jason Foy said that Noel, his client, had provided the government with ""truthful insight into the toxic culture, subpar training, staffing shortages, and dysfunctional management of the now closed Metropolitan Correctional Center. In exchange for Ms. Noel's cooperation, all charges against her were dismissed.""

He added: ""The short comings and mistakes made by Ms. Noel were a result of inexperience, lack of proper and sufficient training, and being put in a position to fail by the leadership of MCC and the Bureau of Prisons.""

""I think it’s indicative of our whole society in disarray and struggling,"" said Eric. ""This is too much for us, mentally and emotionally. We're failing. We’re struggling.""

The motive for the shooting is unknown at this time, and two people who left the home on Jan. 6 refused to talk.

Kistner was booked into jail and is accused of first-degree murder.

Thirteen years later, in 2001, Libyan national Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted of the crime and later released on compassionate grounds in 2009.Shortly after the Lockerbie bombing, one of the worst terrorist attacks in history, some families of the victims joined together to launch a campaign for truth and justice. Among them was Dr Jim Swire whose campaign has taken him to the sand dunes of Libya to meet face-to-face with Colonel Gaddafi, to 10 Downing Street to meet with successive Prime Ministers and to the corridors of power in the US where he worked with the American victims’ groups to mount pressure on Washington for tighter airport security, well before 9/11.The moving series will explore events from 1988 to the present day, while providing an intimate account of a man, a husband, and a father who pushes his marriage, his health, and his sanity to the edge.Jim and Kirsten Sheridan, said: “The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 was one of the world’s deadliest terror attacks that continues to have widespread implications for the meaning of justice in the US, Scotland and Libya.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghislaine-maxwell-has-been-convicted-what-comes-next/,Ghislaine Maxwell's been convicted. What comes next?,"Ghislaine Maxwell found guilty on five out of six counts, including sex trafficking of a minor

Ghislaine Maxwell is behind bars — the same place she's been since she was arrested in July 2020 — after she was found guilty by a New York jury on Wednesday of grooming minors for sexual abuse at the hands of her longtime associate Jeffrey Epstein.

Maxwell was found guilty on five out of six sex trafficking-related charges, and faces up to 65 years if she receives the maximum sentence. A sentencing date has not yet been set.

Maxwell's defense attorneys have already indicated that they plan to appeal the conviction. Bobbi Sternheim, part of Maxwell's defense team, said after the verdict that ""we firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence. We are very disappointed in the verdict. We have already started working on an appeal and we are confident that she will be vindicated.""

Maxwell still faces a second trial on two counts of perjury that were contained in her initial indictment, which allege that she lied under oath about Epstein's sexual abuse as part of accuser Virginia Guiffre's 2016 civil case against the wealthy financier.

The judge previously granted the defense's request to bring the charges into a separate trial. Each perjury charge carries a maximum of five years in prison if she's convicted.

Maxwell was convicted on charges that included conspiracy and transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, related to Epstein's alleged misconduct. She was acquitted on one count of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts.

Epstein, a convicted sex offender who had social ties to a wide range of business and political leaders, died in what officials ruled a suicide in his jail cell at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 2019.

The defense used a three-pronged approach to poke holes in the various statements the accusers have given to government officials over the years, and presented Maxwell as a scapegoat following Epstein's death. At the time of his death, Epstein was in custody awaiting his own trial on sex trafficking charges.

At Maxwell's trial, Sternheim told jurors that ""This case is about memory, manipulation and money."" The defense also highlighted how much money each woman was paid from the Epstein victims' compensation fund.

Maxwell's family said in a statement after the verdict that they ""believe firmly in our sister's innocence.""

""We are very disappointed with the verdict,"" the family said. ""We have already started the appeal tonight and we believe that she will ultimately be vindicated.""

A Ghislaine Maxwell Twitter account run by her brothers and sisters posted Thursday: ""Our next battle is when we go for the Appeal - watch this space.""

Survivors celebrated the conviction as a step toward justice. Annie Farmer, the accuser who testified and waived her right to anonymity at trial, said she was ""relieved and grateful that the jury recognized the pattern of predatory behavior that Maxwell engaged in for years and found her guilty of these crimes.""

""She has caused hurt to many more women than the few of us who had the chance to testify in the courtroom,"" Farmer said in a statement. ""I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it and demonstrates that no one is above the law. Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young.""

But other accusers, like Virginia Robert Giuffre, noted that others who helped enable Epstein's actions for years have yet to be brought to justice. ""I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served,"" she said. ""Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be.""

Giuffre was not a testifying witness nor a named victim in the government's case at this trial, but her name had come up several times in court.

On Wednesday, Maxwell defense attorney Christian Everdell requested additional time to confer with fellow defense lawyers Sternheim, Laura Menninger, and Jeffrey Pagliuca before offering the court a schedule for sentencing. Judge Alison Nathan did not specify how much time they had to file that schedule and has postponed the preparation of the presentence report until then.

What Nathan and defense attorney Sternheim did agree on, however, was ensuring Maxwell had access to a coronavirus vaccine booster shot. Judge Nathan assured Sternheim she had inquired that very morning and confirmed the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Maxwell will remain, has boosters available.

This week, as every graduation week since 1949, the great and the good of maritime strategy converged on Newport for the Naval War College’s Current Strategy Forum. Your humble scribe served on a panel that examined the question: “What do classic works of strategy have to teach us about America’s strategic predicament in the world today?” Herewith, I share with you a smoothed-out version of my remarks:

Classic works have a great deal to tell us: they furnish a starting point for assessing our situation, and they keep us grounded. These are both vital functions. Just ask Rudyard Kipling. In 1919 Kipling published a poem titled “Gods of the Copybook Headings.” Copybook headings were proverbs or maxims that British schoolkids used to copy over and over to practice penmanship. There was a heading at the top of each page, and the students would copy it over and over to fill the page. Therein lay wisdom.

Indeed, Kipling claims that common-sense truisms like “If you don’t work you die” outlast the false Gods of the Marketplace, or the Zeitgeist, or the latest Vision that grips a society or institution. If you lose touch with such permanent verities, he tells us, then “As surely as Water will wet us, [and] as surely as Fire will burn, / The Gods of the Copybook Headings [will] with terror and slaughter return!”

The poem is Kipling’s admonition to heed the wisdom of the ages, using timeless precepts to organize our thinking. And it’s his warning not to delude ourselves that we can repeal fixed, timeless facts of human existence. It constitutes his warning against yielding to fads.

How does this fit with the topic of our panel? Well, classic works of strategy reveal how the Gods of the Strategic Copybook Headings work. Treatises on strategic theory aren’t algorithms or how-to manuals. You can’t flip them open and run the checklist when some strategic problem confronts you. What they do is help us think about our strategic predicament and opportunities, and they anchor us in reality.

Like Kipling’s poem, the classics provide students of strategy with intellectual ballast. And they steady our temperament. Those steeped in the classics aren’t too beguiled by the latest thingamajig to emerge from a weapons lab, or by the latest Big Idea to come out of academia, or out of the business world. By and large, these things are superficial and fleeting. They shouldn’t buffet us too much.

Seldom are those steeped in the strategic canon gulled into thinking that technology, tactics or organizational methods will let us escape permanent dynamics of human conflict. Still less do they succumb to claims that History with a capital H has rendered basic facts about martial strife moot.

Which brings me to sea-power theory. In 1992 the American sea services published their first post–Cold War strategic directive, entitled “. . . From the Sea.” It’s a remarkable document. In the preamble, the sea-service leadership declares rather starkly that America owns the sea. We had won big. The Soviet Navy had vanished from the high seas, much as the Imperial Japanese Navy adorned the seafloor in 1945. With no one left to fight for command of the sea, we could afford to concentrate on projecting power ashore from this offshore safe haven.

The leadership thus sent a strong bureaucratic signal: that battle is passé. That History with a capital H had repealed the most basic fact about naval warfare, namely that you have to win maritime command if you hope to exercise command. It’s no accident that many of the capabilities we’re now scrambling to recreate—long-range anti-surface warfare, to name one—started to decay after 1992. Such atrophy was in keeping with the times, and with official guidance.

Kipling would shake his head at our presumption.

As would Captain Mahan and Sir Julian Corbett, our two sages of sea power here at the College. These were men who looked to history—to the age of wooden ships and iron men—in search of permanent things. They sifted through the past for enduring lessons to help naval officialdom shape future strategy.

Around here we often ask students whether they’re Mahanian or Corbettian, but that’s a false choice. Mahan and Corbett agree on a lot. Together they articulate a composite logic and grammar of maritime strategy that remains as compelling as it was when they wrote a century ago.

Now, Clausewitz teaches that international competition and war have a grammar all their own—the grammar of violent interaction between antagonists determined to get their way. But they don’t have their own logic. The logic of competition comes from policy—from national purposes.

So maritime endeavors are about purpose and power, policy and strategy. Mahan excels at explaining the purposes that drive nations to do business in great waters, while Corbett explains how to use sea power on the operational level to help fulfill national purposes. Mahanian logic, Corbettian grammar: you might almost call it a unified field theory of sea power!

Look at purpose. Mahan tells us the purpose of sea power is to assure commercial, political and military access—in that order—to vital theaters such as East Asia, South Asia and western Europe. To that end, maritime strategy is about amassing commerce, fleets of merchantmen and warships, and naval stations to support distant voyages. Commerce is king for Mahan.

And in case some rival tries to bar commercial, political or military access, maritime strategy is about building a battle fleet capable of fighting “with reasonable prospects of success” against the strongest foe it’s likely to encounter in the waters where it matters most. Winning command of the sea is the surest route to success in maritime strategy. Mahan is the theorist of the stronger navy.

And power? Corbett has little to say about the logic of sea power. His bosses—the likes of Queen Victoria and Admiral Jacky Fisher—knew why Britain needed a navy. But he has a lot to say about the grammar of sea combat. Corbett says he agrees with Mahan that seeking a decisive fleet engagement soon after the outbreak of war is the right course to pursue 90 percent of the time.

Nevertheless, he spends an inordinate amount of time delineating a strategy for that other 10 percent of the time—when we’re the weaker combatant and need time to build up strength and turn the tables on our opponent. This is what Corbett calls “active defense,” or sometimes a “fleet-in-being” strategy. (It’s also eerily similar to Mao’s concept of active defense, which has been and remains the core of Chinese military and maritime strategy.)

Contrary to popular lore, a fleet-in-being is neither inert nor passive. Its commanders try to balk a stronger foe, frustrating his endeavors through offensive tactical blows while searching out ways to make themselves the stronger contestant at the decisive place and time. Flipping the naval balance could mean concentrating scattered fleet detachments. It could mean building additional ships. It could mean finding seagoing allies, or fracturing enemy alliances. Or it could mean doing things that induce the enemy to disperse his strength or do dumb, self-defeating things.

So active defense is a restless, forward-leaning approach to naval warfare—even as its practitioners remain prudent about methods for prosecuting it. “True” defense, then, is about offense for Corbett. It’s about deferring the verdict of arms while positioning ourselves as the stronger antagonist. Rather than seek a decisive battle when the outcome is in doubt, Corbett counsels commanders to be patient—postponing a decision until the contest appears likely to go their way. He thus provides a complete guide to sea combat, spanning both weaker and stronger contenders, where Mahan provides only a partial picture at the operational level.

So there’s your unified, Mahanian/Corbettian copybook. Current or aspiring maritime powers should harness diplomatic, economic and military resources to open access to foreign theaters, and build fleets of merchantmen and warships to carry on and protect commerce there. Should someone oppose U.S. commercial, political, or military access by force, the navy should seek a decisive battle when circumstances appear promising.

If the U.S. Navy is the likely winner where it counts, when it counts, then commanders should seek battle early, as Mahan wants. If not, they should take their cue from Corbett, mounting an active defense until prospects for victory brighten. Either way, decisive battle is the eventual goal.

Only then can we exploit command of the sea. That’s the fallacy of “. . . From the Sea”: it assumed America could enjoy the fruits of command without fighting for command, and would do so more or less forever. It assumed History was on our side following the Soviet collapse—and would remain on our side. That was a dangerous assumption, and we’re coping with its fallout to this day.

No victory is permanent unless we make it so. Let us resolve never again to declare a holiday from maritime history—even if we win big in our next geopolitical competition, as we did in the Cold War and World War II. Great sea powers don’t get to take holidays, especially when maritime history is just beginning for ambitious, saltwater-minded rivals like China.

PLA Navy strategists read Mahan deeply, and have premised their maritime strategy in part on his teachings. Mahan and Corbett help China think about its strategic predicament—just as they help us think about ours.

To avert or manage challenges from the likes of China, let’s constantly improve our ability to fight and win, even if the likelihood of combat appears remote. In so doing we dishearten potential challengers while reassuring allies and friends. In short, let’s heed the teachings of the masters of sea power. Let’s stay on the good side of the Gods of the Copybook Headings—lest they return seeking their revenge.

https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/jeremy-williams-suspect-in-new-death-post-kamarie-holland-charges,Jeremy Williams Suspect In New Death Post-Kamarie Holland Charges,"Jeremy Williams was charged with the sexual assault and murder of 5-year-old Kamarie Holland in Alabama last month. He's now a prime suspect in the 2005 death of his own daughter in Alaska.

An Alabama man accused of killing and raping a five-year-old girl last year may also be behind a separate, unsolved child killing in Alaska dating back to 2005, authorities say.

Jeremy Tremaine Williams, 37, awaiting trial in the human trafficking murder of Kamarie Holland, was accused of the murder of his own infant daughter by police ins Alaska more than a decade ago — and now they are looking into the case again.

Police officials in North Pole, Alaska announced this week that they’d reopened their investigation into Williams’ involvement in the missing infant’s case, more than a decade after the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence, according to Georgia CBS affiliate WRBL.

At the time of the child’s death in 2005, Williams was living in North Pole, Alaska with the infant’s mother, who was an active duty U.S. Air Force member and local police officer. The child died of blunt force trauma, and the case was originally investigated by the Air Force.

Williams, however, was never officially charged in the child’s death. Alaska investigators, who reopened the case following the 37-year-old’s arrest last month, have again labeled him a prime suspect in the long-dormant case.

No further information was available regarding the newly reopened case this week. North Pole Police Chief Steve Dutra wasn’t immediately available to comment on the investigation when contacted by Oxygen.com on Friday afternoon.

More than 4,000 miles away, Williams — along with his Kamarie Holland's mother, Kristy Siple — are in custody in Alabama on capital murder charges in the December murder of Siple's daughter

On Dec. 13, Siple reported her daughter had gone missing from her Columbus, Georgia home. The Alabama mother told authorities she’d found her front door open and no trace of her daughter at the residence, the Montgomery Advertiser previously reported.

Later that day, Williams was arrested at a hotel in Phenix City, Alabama. After his arrest, investigators recovered the five-year-old’s body from a vacant property. Holland had been sexually abused, according to the Russell County Sheriff’s Office. Authorities suspect the little girl died from asphyxiation, but autopsy results are pending.

“This case is still ongoing and very early,” Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor told reporters in December. “There’s a lot of details that I’m not willing to disclose at this time because of the urgency in this case and potential other folks that we may be looking into as suspects or offenders alongside Mr. Williams.”

Siple was later arrested on murder and human trafficking charges in her daughter’s death. She’s expected to face additional rape, sodomy, kidnapping and production of child pornography charges, authorities said.

“The media’s making me look like I’m some evil person, but I’m not,” Kristy Siple had told WIFR in December prior to her arrest. “I’m a mommy, and I did not have nothing to do with this. She was my life. I lived for her daily.”

Following Williams arrest, Alabama investigators pointed out his history of child abuse, citing his potential past involvement in his daughter’s Alaska death.

“We have information where he was a suspect in a one-year-old's death in Alaska where he was a suspect but never charged because of not able to get enough evidence in that case,” Taylor added.

In 2009, Williams also was arrested for allegedly immersing a three-year-old boy’s lower body in boiling water. He was acquitted on those charges by a jury in 2012.

If convicted in Holland’s murder, Williams faces the death penalty, prosecutors said.

“This will be a case in which the death penalty will be sought if the facts continue to unfold as we’re seeing them,” Russell County Chief Deputy District Attorney Rick Chancey also said at a press conference.",Q1
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-potato-wart-announcement-1.6386556,Americans say P.E.I. potatoes to be allowed into mainland U.S. 'soon',"Marie Claude Bibeau tells CBC News: Compass the new export conditions are 'reasonable and based on science.'

'A matter of days' before U.S. border will reopen to P.E.I. potatoes, says Canada's agriculture minister

P.E.I. table potatoes will soon be allowed into the continental U.S. with some conditions, according to a news release Thursday from the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency will lift its ban on exporting P.E.I. table or eating potatoes — but not seed or processing potatoes.

""USDA has determined P.E.I. potatoes for consumption only may resume under specified conditions that will pose little risk of introducing potato wart disease into the United States,"" said the release from APHIS.

Shipments of fresh potatoes to the U.S. mainland have been banned for months, following the discovery of potato wart in two P.E.I. fields in October.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency halted shipments of potatoes to the U.S. in November, prompted by a U.S. threat that it would act if Canada did not. Canadian officials were concerned that an American action would be more difficult to reverse.

""We are confident that table stock potatoes can enter the United States with appropriate safeguards in place to ensure the U.S. potato industry remains protected,"" said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.

The U.S. will require P.E.I. potatoes, as well as the seed potatoes used to produce them, ""originate from fields not known to be infested with potato wart or associated with known infestations,"" the release stated.

Other conditions state that P.E.I. potatoes must be:

washed and sprout-nipped.

graded to meet the U.S. No. 1 standard.

officially inspected by the national plant protection organization of Canada and certified as meeting USDA requirements.

""APHIS will continue to work with Canada to increase confidence in its long-term management plan for potato wart, specifically to finish processing remaining samples associated with recent detections, to expand surveillance of non-regulated fields in P.E.I. and to continue its national surveillance program,"" the release added.

'A great start'

P.E.I. Potato Board chair John Visser of Victoria-by-the-Sea says he doesn't have details but the announcement sounds like ""relatively good news ... it's a great start.""

'It's definitely the first positive news a lot of growers have heard for a long while,' says P.E.I. Potato Board Chair John Visser. (CBC)

He said he doesn't know when Island growers will be able to begin shipping to the U.S. but hopes it will happen soon, as American buyers are anxious to have P.E.I. potatoes.

U.S. potato growers fear that potato wart in Prince Edward Island is far from under control. — U.S. National Potato Council

He'd like to see P.E.I. seed potato shipments cleared for export to the U.S. soon, too.

Visser said he and other growers still can't understand why the potato wart management plan that has been in place for years was deemed inadequate, saying growers ""have great faith"" in it.

""It's going to take a lot of work to get our reputation back, and also compensation for the potatoes that have been destroyed and the damage that was done,"" he said.

Eastern P.E.I. grower Boyd Rose says he is pleased but has mixed emotions about the news. He said he's hearing it could be days or weeks before Island growers can begin shipping to the U.S. again — he's hoping for next Monday.

He said even when the border does reopen, shipping the potatoes will be a huge challenge because it's difficult to get trucks to go to the U.S.

Rose said farmers will never make up for the last four months of lost sales, calling it a ""major hit ... a mental nightmare.""

Bibeau coming to P.E.I.

Federal Agriculture Minister Marie Claude Bibeau called it a ""very good step in the right direction. I think these are reasonable conditions and based on science.""

In an interview with CBC News: Compass, Bibeau said she spoke Thursday with Vilsack, who said it would be ""a matter of days"" before the border reopens.

Potatoes previously shipped to the U.S. were already being washed and sprout-nipped. She said the new U.S. requirements are ""a bit more specific about where the potatoes can come from."" She does not expect bags of potatoes will need to have added stickers indicating they are for eating only, as was the case when shipments resumed to Puerto Rico last month.

Bibeau said she will travel to P.E.I. this weekend to meet with potato growers and will work with them on a ""stronger management plan"" for potato wart.

U.S. growers 'dismayed'

The U.S. National Potato Council, the lobby group for American potato farmers, was quick to condemn the announcement as ""disappointing.""

""We are dismayed to learn that USDA is allowing P.E.I. table stock potatoes to resume shipments to the U.S. prior to completing soil tests for the destructive potato wart disease,"" a news release from the council said.

It said the frequency with which potato wart has been found on P.E.I., plus what it called a dramatic drop in the number of disease tests via soil samples, ""should make U.S. regulators question the prevalence of the disease on the Island.""

""Today's announcement by USDA overlooks the severity of the disease,"" the release said. ""U.S. potato growers fear that potato wart in Prince Edward Island is far from under control.""

'Long-awaited good news'

P.E.I. Premier Dennis King announced the border reopening in the legislature, calling it ""long-awaited good news.""

'It hasn't been easy for anybody,' P.E.I. Premier Dennis King said Thursday of the potato wart crisis that closed to U.S. border to P.E.I. potatoes. (P.E.I. Legislature)

He said some of the protocols to which P.E.I. potatoes will be subject are ""a little bit concerning.""

P.E.I. Opposition leader Peter Bevan-Baker also offered congratulations, adding ""the devil here is going to be in the details,"" noting the Americans' news release did not specify a date when the border would reopen and does not mention access to the U.S. for P.E.I. seed potatoes. He urged the government to look more carefully at its potato wart mitigation plan to ensure such a crisis doesn't happen again.

Puerto Rico reopened in February

Island farmers saw some relief last month when the border was reopened to Puerto Rico, a major customer.

The U.S. fresh potato market is worth about $120 million a year to P.E.I. farmers. Unable to find markets for that many potatoes on short notice, farmers have had to destroy an estimated 300 million pounds (136 million kilograms) of potatoes.

Potato wart was first discovered on the Island in 2000, which also led to a border closure. A management plan was developed in consultation with the Americans that kept the border open for 20 years.",Q1
https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/town-fines-80-year-olds-30k-federal-judge-is-not-pleased/,"Town Fines 80-Year-Olds $30K, Federal Judge Is NOT Pleased","A quote from Judge Steven Seeger of the Northern District of Illinois:

“If the reader is thinking that things have, at this point, gone completely off the rails, buckle up, because the ride is not yet over.”

Federal judges are not immune to hyperbole, but there’s zero lies in Judge Seeger’s statement. Every single allegation in the case of Cozzi v. Village of Melrose Park raises the bonkers bar another notch. By the end, it feels as if nothing about this case could’ve really happened except when you realize many of the allegations were recorded!

Sponsored Content 5 Cost Control Strategies To Manage Law Firm Spend Effective cost control isn’t just about saving money—it’s about creating a foundation for growth, efficiency, and exceptional client service. Read the blog now to power up your practice.

In an opinion handed down earlier this week, Judge Seeger grants in part and denies in much, much larger part the town’s motion to dismiss. The story begins with an elderly couple with a couple of lawn chairs that they use to meet with people at proper social distancing during the pandemic. And yet, village authorities decided lawn furniture was “unsanitary” for unspecified reasons and issued a pair of $500 tickets.

The couple’s adult son complained about the tickets and other mistreatment of his parents at public meetings. At which point… cops gotta cop.

That free expression led to an avalanche of tickets. The Village issued the Cozzis a $500 ticket nearly every business day from December 3, 2020 to March 3, 2021. Christmas Eve was no exception. The tickets would financially cripple the Cozzis, an elderly couple on a fixed income.

Now when Judge Seeger says “financially cripple,” he means it. Melrose Park issued 62 tickets!

Each ticket cost $500, so the Village tagged them with fines totaling about $30,000. And when it was all said and done, the Village slapped them with a lien on their house, for good measure.

What is it with the animus toward the elderly these days? This reminds me of that Michigan judge going after a 72-year-old cancer patient for not mowing his lawn enough.

Anyway, the Melrose Park saga continues. The Cozzis’ son also received a note from a cop about supposed parking violations and then a slew of parking tickets. And then this…

The police surveilled the home several times a day. Michael Cozzi received threatening text messages from unknown or restricted phone numbers. Someone broke his car window. And on one occasion, the Mayor of Melrose Park, Ronald Serpico, drove by and verbally threatened Michael Cozzi with violence.

I want to be crystal clear: all of these allegations are before Judge Seeger warns us to buckle up!

It’s only after that warning do we learn that the town demanded elderly people with health issues attend a hearing in person at the height of the pandemic and when they tried to get a continuance, slapped them with a default judgment on a bunch of the tickets. And then we learn that many of the supposed complaints were apparently fabricated — a FOIA request was returned with the statement that no responsive documents existed. And that many of the tickets were sequentially numbered — as in, no one else in town got a ticket in the meantime. And it’s not like the couple were the only house deviating from some kind of Stepford Neighborhood where no one has any personality:

The fact that the Village wasn’t ticketing anyone else wasn’t for lack of opportunities. The complaint is chock-full of pictures of other houses in the neighborhood. The surrounding lawns are adorned with used mattresses, a 15-foot skeleton with a Santa hat, garbage, and trampolines. There are reindeer, swans, candy canes, stars, pergolas, tchotchkes, and Christmas decorations at various degrees of garishness. Not to mention plenty of lawn furniture. What were those lawns missing? Tickets.

Then the violent harassment from anonymous actors rolls in:

All of a sudden, Michael Cozzi started receiving threats on his phone. He received texts from unknown or blocked numbers. One text told him to get out: “Wait till I see you. I’m splitting your curly wig, you dead beat C*nt. This is my neighborhood; you best get the f*ck out before we make you get out.” Another text – from a restricted number – threatened to kill him. And it threatened his elderly parents, too: Listen, you sheep head motherf*cker. I’m going to put a piece in the back of your motherf*cking skull. I’m going to f*ck your mother and your father. Get the f*ck out of Melrose Park before you catch a f*cking beating. Do you understand me, you f*cking c*nt motherf*cker? Do you have any idea who the f*ck you’re f*cking with? You’ll be dead, you motherf*cker. I’m telling you one time. Last f*cking time I’m going to call you, you piece of sh*t c*nt motherf*cker.

Before going further, let’s take a second to give Judge Seeger proper credit for wordsmithing this horrible account into a compelling, and at times even funny, narrative. I mean… he at one point writes of a particular alleged harasser, “he used the ‘f-word’ over and over, as a noun, a verb, and an adjective” and then hits the carriage return to write the single sentence paragraph, “It was recorded.” That’s positively smurfy writing.

And it’s not the first time we’ve given Judge Seeger a shout-out for his writing. About a week into the first lockdown, a party demanded an “immediate hearing” on a copyright claim and Judge Seeger… was not happy. The Judge is rapidly climbing the ranks of my favorite federal bench reads.

Now we come to the mayor’s comments when the couple’s son tried to speak at a public meeting. To frame what comes next, Judge Seeger writes:

That’s when Mayor Serpico completely lost it. He lost his cool. He lost his temper. And if he has any ability to express himself without using expletives, he lost that too.

There’s a recording of this which you can listen to here in this video by the Sun-Times. Otherwise check out Judge Seeger’s abridged account below:

Mayor Serpico spewed the following missive: “I’m going to tell you something, you’re really reaching me. So, do me a f*cking favor and sit down and shut the f*ck up. How’s that? You little f*cking pr*ck. Go on, shake your f*cking head. You’re nothing but a f*cking punk.” Michael Cozzi responded with a simple question: “What did I do to you?” Id. That innocent question sent Mayor Serpico into the next stratosphere. What he lacked in elegance – and in range of vocabulary – he made up for in directness: “You’re a jag off! You look like a f*cking shine on 15th [avenue] because you’re doing it to bust f*cking balls. That’s what your doing. So, go f*ck yourself. Go f*ck yourself!” Michael Cozzi then asked about his broken window. Id. That didn’t go over well. When it came to expletives, Mayor Serpico still had some gas left in the tank: “I give a f*ck about your window. Like I worry about your f*cking house when I drive past it. Now do me a favor and go sit down and shut up.”

With regard to the word “shine,” Judge Seeger notes in a footnote:

The word “shine” is a disparaging term for a black person. It comes “from shoeshine, for the fact they often shine shoes for richer white folks.” Shine, Urban Dictionary, https://www.urbandictionary.com/ define.php?term=shine (last accessed March 21, 2022). It was more common in the early 20th century. But apparently, it is still part of Mayor Serpico’s repertoire.

“The tirade may not have creative value, but it did have evidentiary value,” writes Judge Seeger. Indeed.

Describing the incident at the meeting, the opinion notes:

[The Mayor] told [the son] where to go, and then some. The Village told the Cozzis where to go, but they went to the federal courthouse instead.

It’s easy around these parts to get deeply cynical about law and justice and the federal judiciary. But sometimes there’s a story like this and a direct, scathing opinion like this. A court willing to dispense with the law’s embrace of a contrived, mealy-mouthed objectivity and just call out abuse. This may only be the motion to dismiss, but Melrose Park may want to read the room and start talking settlement.

Iran claimed responsibility for a missile barrage that struck Iraq's northern Kurdish regional capital of Erbil in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Iraq's Foreign Ministry summoned Iran's ambassador to protest the attack, calling it a flagrant violation of its sovereignty.

No serious injuries were reported, but the Kurdish K24 TV channel's studio and other buildings nearby were damaged.

Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard said on its website it launched the strike against an Israeli ""strategic center of conspiracy"" in Erbil, warning of more attacks.

It did not elaborate but said Israel had itself been on the offensive, citing the recent strike that killed two Revolutionary Guards. Israel did not respond to the allegations.

During a phone call to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi said his country should not become ""a stage for settling external scores.""

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US condemned the attack ""the strongest terms.""

""We will support the Government of Iraq in holding Iran accountable, and we will support our partners throughout the Middle East in confronting similar threats from Iran,"" Sullivan said in a written statement released by the White House.

""This attack targeted a civilian residence in Erbil, the Kurdistan Region’s capital city, without any justification,"" he added.

US working to help Iraq get missile defense capabilities

The Kurdish regional government denied that there were any Israeli centers in its territory.

Instead, it said Iran targeted the missiles at the United States consulate and instead hit areas around the compound.

But Washington seemed to dispute the claim, saying they had ""no indications the attack was directed at the United States.""

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington was trying to boost Iraq's defense.

""We are in consultation with the Iraqi government and the government in Iraqi Kurdistan, in part to help them get the missile defense capabilities to be able to defend themselves in their cities,"" Sullivan told CBS.

The German Foreign Office condemned the attack saying it should hamper the fight against ISIS.

""Attacks on diplomatic personnel, representatives, and facilities of the global coalition against Daesh are unacceptable. The perpetrators of this attack must be held accountable,"" it said in a statement.",Q1
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northeast-ohio-hospitals-place-hundreds-105725331.html,Northeast Ohio hospitals place hundreds of workers on leave for refusing COVID-19 vaccine,"The vast majority of Akron-area hospital employees have opted to roll up their sleeves and get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Still, Northeast Ohio hospitals have collectively placed hundreds of workers on leave for refusing to get the required shot.

A mandate issued by the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services and upheld last month by the U.S. Supreme Court requires health care workers to get at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Feb. 14 and the second of a two-dose vaccine by March 15.

Hospitals that don't comply with the federal mandate could face hefty fines.

On Thursday, Akron Children’s Hospital said 66 employees were not compliant with the vaccine mandate. Akron Children’s Hospital set its own deadline of Jan. 11 for the first dose.

Cleveland Clinic also said fewer than 450 of its 65,000 employees systemwide in the U.S. are on unpaid leave after not getting the vaccine. The Cleveland Clinic set a Jan. 27 date for workers to get at least one dose of a COVID vaccine.

Summa Health was the first hospital in the Akron area to set its deadline for employees and contractors to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 31 of last year or face termination.

In a statement, Akron Children’s Hospital Chief Operating Officer Lisa Aurilio said the 66 employees who still haven't complied with the COVID vaccine mandate represent less than 1% of the hospital's workforce.

A Children’s Hospital spokeswoman said no further information was available, including how many employees initially were put on leave Jan. 11 or when the leave-of-absences would become terminations.

“We are hopeful that number will decrease as additional employees have indicated a willingness to comply, and we are willing to work with them,"" Aurilio said. ""We are sorry to lose employees who have chosen to end their employment rather than comply. A vaccinated workforce is the best protection we can offer our patients, especially those who are most vulnerable, and is the best way to move beyond the pandemic.”

At the Cleveland Clinic, 751 employees systemwide initially were placed on an unpaid leave following the Jan. 27 deadline if they didn't have a COVID-19 vaccine or approved exemption, according to a spokesperson.

“We are proud that the vast majority of our caregivers chose to comply with the mandate,"" the Cleveland Clinic statement read.

The Cleveland Clinic hospital system includes Akron General, Medina Hospital and Mercy Hospital in Canton.

A Cleveland Clinic Akron General spokeswoman said the health system was not releasing a breakdown of employee vaccination rates per hospital.

Ohio is among 24 states to have the February and March deadlines. Several other states were part of a separate legal action that was not struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court and had until Jan. 27 and Feb. 28 to meet the original deadlines.

Other Akron region hospitals' progress on COVID-19 vaccinations

Here’s how other hospitals with operations in the Akron region are faring in meeting the Feb. 14 and March 15 COVID-19 vaccination deadlines:

Western Reserve Hospital in Cuyahoga Falls has a 96% employee COVID vaccination rate, up from 91.4% in mid-January, the hospital reported. In a statement, Chief Human Resources Officer Heather L. Milicevic said: “Western Reserve Hospital will be compliant with the Federal healthcare worker vaccination requirement by the February 14, 2022, deadline. All employees not currently vaccinated have received notice of the need to submit validation of either the first dose of a two-dose vaccination series or the single-dose vaccination by 12 noon on February 14, 2022. Those employees who have not complied with this policy will be placed on leave on February 14, 2022.”

Holli Cholley, chief nursing and operations officer for Bath-based Crystal Clinic Orthopaedic Center, with operations throughout Summit County, said the system would be compliant by the Feb. 14 deadline: “We are offering on site vaccine clinics and also assisting our staff through the medical and religious exemption process to ensure compliance. We currently are 91% compliant. Pursuant to the mandate, employees not compliant by the deadline, will be placed on a leave of absence by February 10, 2022, so that we can plan for and secure staffing to care for our patients as the federal deadline approaches.""

Cleveland-based University Hospitals, with offices throughout Summit County and a hospital in Ravenna, has not indicated how many of its caregivers are vaccinated. UH issued a statement, which reads in part: “We will comply with federal requirements and updated deadlines. Since the vaccine became available in late 2020, University Hospitals has encouraged our caregivers to get vaccinated, educated them on the benefits of vaccination, and made vaccines readily available. The overwhelming majority of our caregivers are vaccinated. We believe, consistent with the scientific consensus, that COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are the most effective way to protect our caregivers, patients and community from severe illness resulting in hospitalization and death.”

In a statement on January 3, community-based civil and human rights organisation The Sikh Coalition said that New York City resident Singh was physically attacked and berated near his cab at JFK International Airport here.

Singh had parked his cab at the Terminal 4 taxi stand when another driver blocked his vehicle. When Singh picked up a customer, he stepped out of his car to ask the other driver to move. The other driver attempted to hit Singh with his own car door; he then began repeatedly punching Singh in the head, chest, and arms, knocking off his turban, it said in a statement.

The other driver called Singh Â“turbaned peopleÂ” and shouted at him to Â“go back to your country,Â” according to the statement.

""I was shocked and angered to be assaulted for doing nothing but minding my own business. While working, no one should experience such hate. I am hopeful that the police can identify, arrest, and charge the person who attacked me so that I can move forward,Â” the Sikh taxi driver, identified only as Mr Singh out of respect for his request for privacy, has told The Sikh Coalition.

Singh filed a report with the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) immediately after the incident. The Sikh Coalition said it is currently working to ensure that the report Â“paints an accurate picture of the attack given the language barrier during the initial conversations.Â”

The organisation's staff accompanied Singh to a meeting with a detective to provide language assistance and legal support.

""We have every expectation that bias will be considered as a factor in this outrageous attack, given the evidence of what the other driver said and did to Mr Singh,Â” said Amrith Kaur Aakre, Sikh Coalition Legal Director.

Â“The Sikh Coalition is appreciative of all who have stepped forward to support Mr. Singh and called attention to his assault. As the investigation moves forward, we will work towards a just outcome that holds the attacker accountable for his actions, while also reiterating that the Sikh community remains an integral part of New York City,Â” Aakre said.

Navjot Pal Kaur had posted the 26-second video of the attack on January 4 on Twitter and it soon went viral.

Kaur tweeted, Â“This video was taken by a bystander at John F Kennedy international Airport. I do not own the rights to this video.

But I just wanted to highlight the fact that hatred continues to remain in our society and unfortunately I've seen Sikh cab drivers get assaulted again and again.Â”

Simran Jeet Singh, author and Director for the Aspen Institute's Inclusive America Project, had tweeted: Â“Another Sikh cab driver assaulted. This one at JFK Airport in NYC. So upsetting to see. But it's crucial that we don't look awayÂ…What I am sure of is how painful it is to watch our fathers and elders get assaulted while they're just trying to live an honest life.Â”

Â“For those who aren't Sikh, I can't put into words what it means to have your turban knocked off Â— or to see someone else's turban knocked off. It's visceral and gut-wrenching and just so disheartening to witness,Â” Singh tweeted.

India's Consulate General in New York had termed the assault on the Sikh taxi driver as ""deeply disturbingÂ” and said it had taken up the matter with the US authorities and urged them to investigate this violent incident.

The US State Department also said it was Â“deeply disturbedÂ” by reports of the attack on the Sikh cab driver at JFK International Airport, captured on video.

""Our diversity makes the US stronger, & we condemn any form of hate-based violence,Â” State Department's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) had tweeted.

Â“We all have a responsibility to hold perpetrators of hate crimes accountable for their actions, no matter where such crimes occur,Â” it had tweeted.

Singh has retained the Sikh Coalition to provide free legal guidance as the investigation into his attacker moves forward.

The organisation said that out of respect for Singh's Â“privacy (given that his turban was knocked off) and in accordance with his request that he not be publicly identified, the Sikh Coalition is not further sharing that footage at this time.Â”

It voiced concern that Sikhs in the United States continue to experience bias and hate-driven attacks on account of their visually identifiable articles of faith (including turbans) as well as perceptions about their country of origin.

According to the most recent FBI data, Sikhs remain in the top three most frequently targeted groups for religiously-motivated hate crimes and bias incidents nationwide.

In the Sikh Coalition's experience, taxi and rideshare drivers in particular are at a heightened risk of these kinds of violent attacks, it said.",Q1

Adam Cessna, 39, admitted at a hearing this week to filing bogus documents on behalf of a fictitious company to obtain nearly $100,000 from the Payroll Protection Program in June 2020. He was charged in late January.

U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Howe Hendricks accepted his plea agreement Wednesday to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

""Are you guilty?"" she asked at one point.

""Yes, ma'am,"" he replied.

Cessna is the second area resident charged this year with bilking the U.S. Small Business Administration's forgivable loan program with the help of ""others, both known and unknown,"" according to court documents.

A common thread between the cases is that both applicants obtained the money while working for Boeing Co. in North Charleston. They're no longer employed for the 787 planemaker, which appears to be a victim of circumstance.

Cessna's LinkedIn profile shows the Ohio native and Air Force veteran joined the company in 2012 as a manufacturing technician and that he was a program administrator from late 2015 until February.

""I was at Boeing for the last 10 years,"" he told the judge when asked about his work history. ""I recently left there.""

Assistant U.S. Attorney Amy Bowers said Cessna wired fake payroll and tax documents in April 2020 to apply for the SBA loan through an out-of-state bank. According to an online database, the money was supposed to help save 11 jobs at an automotive repair and maintenance business on Palmetto Hall Boulevard in Mount Pleasant called Adams Detailing. The $99,356 was deposited into his personal bank account.

Cessna, who waived his right to be indicted by a grand jury, faces up to five years in prison or a $250,000 fine. He will be sentenced later.

The other ex-Boeing worker who defrauded the loan program is Suzanne Weintraub, also of Mount Pleasant. She was charged about two weeks before Cessna with illegally obtaining more than $122,000.",Q1
https://www.veteranstoday.com/2022/01/14/deceased-nobel-peace-laureate-desmond-tutu-faces-zionist-reputational-firing-squad/,Deceased Nobel Peace Laureate Desmond Tutu Faces Zionist Reputational Firing Squad,"JEA: I did interview Miko Peled, “an Israeli General’s Son,” in 2018. The interview can be read here. Peled certainly has something to say about what is actually happening in Palestine.

…by Miko Peled

“I have been to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and I have witnessed the racially segregated roads and housing that reminded me so much of the conditions we experienced in South Africa under the racist system of Apartheid.” Desmond Tutu

According to the January 11 issue of Newsweek magazine, while speaking on Fox News, former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said, “The man was a rampant antisemite and bigot,” referring to Desmond Tutu.







The Guardian, writing about the passing of the archbishop, also mentioned Dershowitz’s absurd accusation. The piece says correctly that “[a] figure of Tutu’s stature drawing parallels between a system constructed on racism and the reality of Israel’s domination of the Palestinians, and calling for boycotts to end it, alarmed the government in Israel.”

The piece goes on to report that “[a]ll of this earned Tutu a particular ire from some of Israel’s defenders. The Anti-Defamation League accused him of antisemitism over his boycott call.” The report continues to say:

Citing at least half a dozen instances in which the anti-apartheid activist spoke out against Israel, ZOA president Morton Klein criticized Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law for hosting Tutu … and the University of Pennsylvania for inviting Tutu to be its commencement speaker.

Also chiming in was Yishai Fleisher, spokesman for the militant religious-Zionist settlers in Hebron. He posted on Twitter:

Tutu was a serious enemy of Israel because he used his clout as an anti-apartheid warrior to stick that ignominious epithet onto Israel. But underneath the nice guy facade he was [sic] religious antisemite, a supporter of the genocidal Hamas terror, and a serial liar.?

I am quite speechless that anyone could characterize Tutu as a racist. However, the claim that Tutu was an antisemite is not new. In 2003 the Forward reported: “The Zionist Organization of America has denounced two universities for inviting Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu to speak on their campuses.”

According to a piece in the Jewish Telegraph Agency, or JTA, from October of 2007, “Bishop Desmond Tutu had been slated to visit the University of St. Thomas next spring as part of a program that brings Nobel laureates to teach youth about peace and justice.”

However, in a strange chain of events, university administrators concluded that “Tutu has made hurtful comments about Israel and the Jewish people that rendered him inappropriate as a speaker.”

These administrators reached this puzzling conclusion “after consulting with Minnesota Jewish leaders.” One of these “leaders” was Julie Swiler, the public affairs director for the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, (JCRC), a Zionist not-for-profit that is charged with monitoring activities that show Israel in a negative light and acting to stop them.

Swiler told JTA that the university approached her organization for an opinion about Tutu, which led her to discover a speech Tutu delivered in Boston in 2002. “He compared the power of the “Jewish lobby” to Hitler, and Israeli policies to those of the South African apartheid regime.

What the archbishop actually said was:

People are scared in this country to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful – very powerful.”

He went on to say:

We live in a moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Pinochet, Milosovic and Idi Amin were all powerful, but in the end, they bit the dust.”

According to Swiler, “those comments go beyond legitimate criticism of Israel.”

Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), said that “Desmond Tutu is an antisemite who hates Jews and is obsessed with demeaning and smearing the Jewish state.”

Klein claimed that Tutu delivered a speech in 2002 at a conference that was sponsored by the Palestinian organization Sabeel, which Klein says is “a Christian Palestinian group that some have described as antisemitic.”

Sabeel is a peace-loving Christian Palestinian organization. The organization’s website states:

Sabeel is an ecumenical grassroots liberation theology movement among Palestinian Christians. Inspired by the life and teaching of Jesus Christ, this liberation theology seeks to deepen the faith of Palestinian Christians, to promote unity among them and lead them to act for justice and peace.

Weaponizing antisemitism

It is well known that the extent to which Zionists around the world use antisemitism as a tool to silence those who reject their racism, hate and violence know no boundaries. When public figures dare to stand for justice – even if, like Archbishop Desmond Tutu, they do not reject Zionism completely – they are immediately labeled as antisemitic.

After the success of the Zionist campaign to bring down the U.K. Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and demonize many of his supporters — many of whom were Jewish themselves – there is no reason to expect that these hate-filled lies about people who fight for justice will stop.

Like a bully with a loaded weapon, Zionist organizations in the United States and around the world will continue to feel entitled to call anyone they wish a racist, a bigot, and an antisemite. Their successes empower them and, since there is no one who stands up to them, there is no reason for them to stop.

South Africa

A few years ago I had the privilege of visiting South Africa to participate in the Israeli Apartheid Week, and it was during that visit that I walked down the famous Vilakazi Street.

While there, I was also invited to take part in a discussion that was broadcast live on SABC television. The discussion was between myself and an Israeli who was sent to represent Israel and the view that Israel is anything but an apartheid state.

At the 3:56 mark of the program, I was asked by the moderator to explain why Israel is an apartheid state, which of course, is quite easy to do. At 8:30 in, the moderator asked the other guest to explain how what I described is not apartheid.

This was followed by about 30 seconds of silence, confusion, and incoherent mumbling. When he was finally able to speak, it was clear that he was not able to answer the question.

People in South Africa cannot be fooled by Israeli propaganda; they know apartheid and they can see it even from the six thousand miles that separate Cape Town from Jerusalem. Furthermore, the two Nobel Peace laureates who lived on Vilakazi Street in Soweto and fought the apartheid regime in South Africa knew all too well that Israel is an apartheid regime.

https://www.azosensors.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2417,The Use of Pressure Sensors in Sleep Apnea Devices,"Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder that affects 3% to 7% of the population. As research into the disorder has increased in recent years, scientists are beginning to understand it as an important cause of medical morbidity and mortality.

Image Credit: tommaso79/Shutterstock.com

Continuous PAP (CPAP), bi-level PAP (BiPAP) and automatic PAP (APAP) machines are often prescribed to those with sleep apnea to keep the airway open by sending air pressure via a mask to prevent the recurrent collapsing or narrowing of the airway.

Now, new technology is enhancing the reliability and performance of PAP devices via the integration of a multi-range pressure sensor. The innovation will help manage the condition, potentially improving the quality of life of those diagnosed with sleep apnea, and perhaps even reducing mortality rates.

Sleep Apnea can be Fatal, New Strategies are Needed to Treat The Condition

Around 38,000 people in the US die from heart disease, with sleep apnea as a complicating factor each year. The condition, a fairly common sleep disorder, is characterized by the repeated stopping and starting of breathing while a person is sleeping. As a result, the brain can become deprived of oxygen.

Left untreated, sleep apnea can increase a person’s chance of developing many serious and life-threatening health conditions and illnesses. Sleep apnea increases a person’s chance of experiencing heart failure by 140% and coronary heart disease by 30% and has been associated with an increased risk of dementia. It has also been linked with depression, potentially due to the disruption it causes to the sleep cycle.

A CPAP machine is usually the most common treatment route for people with sleep apnea. Therefore, the efficacy of such machines is vital to ensuring the long-term health of those with sleep apnea and perhaps even protecting them from the illnesses associated with it.

Enhancing CPAP/BiPAP/APAP Devices with Pressure Sensors

This year, Superior Sensor Technology, a US producer of sensors and sensor-based systems for the industrial, medical and HVAC markets, released its new CPAP/BiPAP/APAP pressure sensors that promise to will significantly enhance the reliability and performance of PAP devices as well as simplify the manufacturing process.

The new technology launched by Superior Sensor Technology in October 2021 integrates two individual pressure sensors: one differential pressure sensor to measure airflow and a gauge sensor to measure airway pressure. The CP201, the inaugural product from the CP Series, is a first-of-its-kind dual sensor that incorporates both these pressure sensors.

The differential pressure sensor it includes supports four programmable pressure ranges 250 to 2.5k Pa (1 to 10 inH20), while the gauge pressure sensor supports four programmable pressure ranges from 2 to 6k Pa (8 to 24 inH20). Tests have demonstrated the system’s accuracy to be within 0.05% of the selected range, which translates to a Total Error Band typically within 0.15% FSS, placing it in an industry-leading position in terms of accuracy.

The CP201 offers to enhance CPAP/BiPAP/APAP devices via: reducing board space and design complexity, making the systems easier to manufacture and maintain; decreasing the number of components used to construct the device, which increases the reliability of the device and while reducing the likeliness of performance errors.

It also works on eliminating critical pneumatic noise with advanced digital filtering provided by the NimbleSense architecture, which improves the sensor output’s signal to noise ratio; streamlining the manufacturing process by allowing the same device to be incorporated into multiple PAP devices, and improving accuracy with the optional closed-loop control feature of the system.

Overall, the technology increases the accuracy and reliability of PAP devices used to manage sleep apnea while streamlining the manufacturing process. These enhancements could lead to better management of sleep apnea, thus enhancing the quality of life of those with the condition and possibly even reducing associated mortality rates.

New Technology Will Address the Increasing Prevalence of Sleep Apnea

While sleep apnea can affect anyone, specific populations are more susceptible. Age acts as a risk factor in developing sleep apnea, with elderly populations more likely to develop the sleep disorder.

As the elderly population increases as modern medicine help us to live longer, the number of people diagnosed with sleep apnea follows the trend.

As a result, manufacturers of PAP devices are increasingly being put under pressure to produce cost-effective devices with technological advancements. The new sensor-driven technology from Superior Sensor Technology offers a solution. The new CP Series enhances device performance and reliability while bringing down production costs with its streamlined design.

In the future, it is likely that we will see further developments in this technology, with the market for sleep apnea devices, predicted to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% between 2021 and 2028.

Shaking confidence in something can undermine its success — even when everything is working.

The people who lined up in some of the state’s grocery stores this week were there, in part, because last year’s winter storm and electric blackouts wrecked their confidence in the reliability of the electric grid.

The storm this week isn’t nearly as severe as the one a year ago. Electric companies were on high alert, and prepared in ways they weren’t last year. The state’s politicians, worried that a blackout would be as bad for their reelection chances as it is for the health of Texas residents, were much more diligent. So were the rest of us, which is why we were buying water and food and batteries.

The system is working like it’s supposed to. If it keeps going this way, we could regain our assurance that the people in control can keep the lights on when the weather is nasty.

If only all of us could do that with elections.

Failure isn’t the only way to shake public confidence. You can destroy confidence by attacking an election system that works, just because it turned President Donald Trump out of office.

“We all know who won in 2020,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told the crowd at a Trump rally in Conroe last Saturday, repeating the “Big Lie” that is the heartbeat of Trump’s post-presidency. Patrick and state Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller both let the crowd know they want Trump to run again in 2024. Both are themselves up for reelection this year, depending on the support of a Texas Republican Party still in thrall to the former president.

A fair number of those voters can’t believe they were outnumbered in the 2020 election, that the majority of American voters disagreed with them, and that the Electoral College produced the same result as the popular vote. Trump won in Texas, besting Joe Biden by more than 600,000 votes, or 5.6 percentage points. But nationally, Biden got 7.1 million more votes, and won the Electoral College 306-232.

For all of the keening about it, the election wasn’t all that close. But Trump and his supporters won’t let go, protesting the vote counting, launching an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, pressing forward with new voting laws spurred by unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and holding rallies — like the one Saturday — promoting the idea that any election they don’t win is corrupted.

At the rally, Trump raised that specter himself, saying Texas is “never, ever turning blue — that is, unless they rig the election.” To Abbott, he added, “Don’t let ’em do it, governor.”

When the 2000 presidential election results were questioned by the Democrats backing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, Republicans for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney pushed back hard — and successfully. Republican sloganeers turned out satirical versions of the Gore/Lieberman signs that instead said “Sore/Loserman,” and “Enough is enough.”

The 2000 election protest ended before the end of 2000, after the U.S. Supreme Court decided against allowing a Florida recount and Gore conceded. The Democrats weren’t happy about losing, but they didn’t storm the Capitol. The public wouldn’t have supported them if they had tried.

Here we are, a couple of decades later: same shoe, different foot.

This time, the sore losers haven’t given up. Some of them hold state positions in Texas, administering and defending the very system that produced Biden’s win over Trump, and that produced their own wins, too. The state’s top Republicans can rally with Trump and others and cry foul about the elections if they want. But they’re products of the same system they protest.

Protest enough election results, and people will start believing you. It erodes their confidence, just like confidence was eroded when the lights went off last February. The elections didn’t fail like the grid failed. They just didn’t produce the result the minority of voters preferred.

Messing with that is a dangerous thing to do, if your power depends on their confidence in your democracy.
